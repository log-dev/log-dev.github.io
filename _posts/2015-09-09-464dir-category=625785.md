The role (Role) that WordPress contains by default cannot be specified in detail. Introduce plug-ins that can classify this in more detail and distribute permissions.

### User Role Editor 소개

The User Role Editor can easily change a user`s role (except Administrator) with just a few clicks. WordPress has a default randomly selectable role: subscriber, editor, contributor, author, etc., but this plug-in allows users to add new roles as needed. In addition, authorization can be fine-tuned as capabilities can be added and removed in each role (including basic roles).

It is applicable to both existing and new users, and it can also be given features per user. Several roles can be assigned at the same time if desired. It also supports multi-site.

You can connect to your own WordPress and search the plug-in to the User Role Editor to install it.

### User Role Editor Usage

After installing the plug-in, the user has a menu called User Role Editor when they access WordPress`s Administrator panel.

- Select Role and change it capabilities: When you select the desired role in the Select box, the page automatically updates and displays a list of features for the selected role is displayed.
- Show capabilities in human readable form: instead of standard form forms such as wordpress `edit_page`, it is used to indicate functional names of forms in a format such as `edit page` that is easy for people to read. Hover the mouse over each function to indicate a different name.
- Show predefined capabilities: Displays the role functionality that disappeared as WordPress was updated.
- Update: Check/uncheck the function to be granted and use the update button to save the changes. If you are using a multisite, check and update Apply to All Sites to apply the changes to all sites.
- Reset: After installing the plug-in, use it if the role functions need to be restored after the first modification or before. Be aware that you will lose all of the user roles that have changed since WordPress was installed.
- Add Role: Use this button to create a custom role. You can also choose a new name and copy existing roles from a drop-down list. Latin alphabetic characters, numbers, and the "_" symbol must be used as role names, and if no role is selected, the Subscriber role is copied by default.
- Add Capability : Used to add new user functions. Latin alphabetic characters, numbers, and "_" symbols are used as names. To use the added features, you need to check the features and verify that they are present in the plug-in or in the `function.php` file of the active theme file.
PHP
` if (!current_user_can(`some_capability_you_added`)) {
echo "You don`t have permission for it!";
return;
}
`
- Delete Capability: Use this button if you need to delete the role function from the added function or old plug-in. At first, this button is created if functions are added with Add Capability, although it is not visible.

The User Role Editor allows users to grant additional features directly. If you open the user list and mouse over a user who needs to add features, you will see a link to "Capabilities".
