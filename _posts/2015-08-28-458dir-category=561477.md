This is a description of the other files included in the boiler plate.

### .gitignore

Boiler plates have `.gitignore` files that are at the level of basic project. As you may know if you have used Git, this allows you to specify files that will not be uploaded where they are used as storage. In other words, it is helpful to set up files that will not be reflected in the repository and to specify and exclude sources and directories that are different from the development environment or that are needed only in a specific environment.

Certain OS and certain editor files need to be `globalignore` to be applied to all repositories in the system.

For example, the home directory `.gitignore` adds the following to `~/.gitconfig` including files and directories that you want to ignore globally:

```git
[core]
excludesfile = ~/.gitignore

```

### .editorconfig

The `.editorconfig` file helps you and your team define and maintains a consistent coding style between other editors and IDE.

Basically, `.editorconfig` reflects the coding style of the file provided by default, but contains several basic properties that can be changed more easily to suit the needs of the user.

Plug-in installation is required to apply `.editorconfig` file properties to editors and IDE.

If the server configuration provided by the boiler plate is not used, the sensitive information shall not be disclosed.Access to the editorconfig` file should be blocked.

For more information, see EditorConfig project.

### Server Configuration

Boiler plates include `.htaccess` files for setting up Apache servers. If you do not use an Apache on the Web, download the server configuration file for your server.

The `.htaccess` file is used for:

- Rewriting URLs (rebuild URL)
- Controlling cache
- Authentication(인증)
- Server-side enclosures (including server side)
- Redirects
- Gzipping (compressed)

If you have access to the main server configuration file (usally called httpd.conf), you should add the logic for the main server configuration file (if you have access to the main server configuration file), if you have access to the main server configuration file. This is a commonly recommended method because accessing an Apache using a `.htaccess` file slows down.

To enable the Apache module locally, check https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-apache/wiki/How-to-enable-Apache-modules.

The use of `.htaccess` is:

- Allows cross-origin access to webfonts.
- CORS header for images when browser requests
- 404.html enable for 404 error document
- Create a better website experience for IE users
- Text encoding for `text/html` and `text/plain` to UTF-8
- enable rewrite URLs engine
- Force or delete `www.` at the beginning of the URL
- Blocking access to directories without default documents
- Block access to files that can expose sensitive information
- Reduce the risk for MIME types
- Forced compression (gzipping)
- It tells the browser whether a specific file should be requested from the server and whether it should be held as a browser cache.

When using `.htaccess`, it is recommended that all annotations be read at least once (the rules after `#`). There are plenty of options prepared.

### crossdomain.xml

A cross-domain policy file is an XML document that provides a way to process data across multiple domains from a web client (Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Reader, etc.).

- granting read access to data
- Allow clients with user request headers in cross-domain
- Grant privileges to socket-based connections

e.g.) If a client hosts content from a particular source domain and the content is a request to a domain other than its own, the remote domain needs to host a cross-domain policy file to grant access to the source domain and allow the client to continue transactions.

For more information, see Adobe`s cross-domain policy file specification.

### robots.txt

The "robots.txt" file is used to indicate what web robots can crawl on websites.

Basically, the file provided by the boiler plate contains two lines:

- `User-agent: *`: For all web robots, see the following:
- `Disallow`: Nothing is prohibited, so everything on the website can be crawled.

To prevent crawling to a specific page, you can specify a path (e.g. `Disallow: / Path Name`) after the `Disallow` indicator, or to prevent crawling for all content, you can set it as `Disallow: /`.

The file `/robots.txt` is not intended for access control and should not be used as such. Instead of recognizing it as a locked door, it is thought of as a symbol for "items that do not exist". URLs that are not allowed in the robots.txt file can be indexed without being crawled. The contents of the robots.txt file reveal the location of your personal content for potentially anyone to see. If you want to block access to private content, use appropriate authentication instead.

- How Google handles the robots.txt file

### browserconfig.xml

The "browserconfig.xml" file is used to customize the tiles displayed when the user locks the page to the start screen in Windows 8.1. Custom tile colors, custom images, or live tiles can be specified.

Basically, tile images for two positions are provided.

- `tile.png` (558x558px) : used for small, medium, and large tiles. This image is automatically re-aligned as needed.
- `tile-wide.png` (558x270px) : used for wide tiles.

When adding a site to a favorite, IE11 shows that it uses the same image.
