When you download various media (movies, animations, games, etc.) via P2P or Webhard, NFO files are sometimes included. Get a description of the NFO file and a viewer who can see it.

### What is an NFO file?

An iNFormation (NFO) file is a type of file that contains information about the file. For video media, it contains encoding and release information; for games or installation files, it includes installation methods or crack and cracker information. This is where the first distributor of the file writes down information about the file, so I recommend that you sometimes look through NFO files if they are not specified in the installation method.

You can open and view the file through the built-in notebook provided in Windows. Open Notepad, drag and drop the nfo file!

Of course, we have to bear the traces of meaningless typing with mysterious and violent texts appearing here and there like the picture above.

I opened the same file through NFO file viewers.

### Troubleshooting NFOPad

Q: I can`t connect the text file to the NFOPad!

A : Text files can sometimes be harder to connect to other programs than Notepad. If you can`t connect a text file using NFOPad`s connection option, try the following method: :

- Right-click the file in Windows Explorer to select "Connector".
- Press "Select Program..."
- Select NFOPad from the list or click "Browse..." to add it.
- Displays the "Always use the selected program when opening this file type" check box.
- Press "OK".

Q : Do I need to uninstall the previous version before installing the new version of NFOPad?

A: No, just make sure the NFOPad is closed and install it in the same folder.

Some people do art in ASCII.
