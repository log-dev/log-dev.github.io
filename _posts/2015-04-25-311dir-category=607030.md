Learn about the content elements located in the body of a web document. Note that these are the basic elements that make up the content, and that there are new attributes or elements added in HTML5.

### P Element

p The element presents a paragraph (Paraph).

```html
There is no paradise where you have fled and arrived.</p>

```

- Paragraphs may indicate the starting and ending points of the same topic.
- may contain a variety of factors, such as a, input element, etc.

### BLOCKQUOTE ELEMENTS

The blockquote element displays quotes in the form of blocks.

```html
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. The worlds leading conservation organization, WWF works...
</blockquote>

```

- The cited content is relatively special and needs to be quickly identified by the user. By default, browsers apply both indentation.
- Use the q element when quoting external content (source) and the internal content.

The cite attribute specifies the source of the cited content.

This property is defined as the property used by blockquote or the q element, but does not specify its purpose, and the browser still does not support this property.

### UL Element

The ul element displays an ordered list.

```html
<ul>
<li>One</li>
<li>Two</li>
</ul>

```

- Specifies the list type and is used with the child element, li.
- An unordered list simply lists the list items without ordering, and displays each list item using a bullet.

### OL Element

ol Elements display ordered lists.

- This element specifies the list type and is used in conjunction with the child element, li.
- Ordinal lists are used when ordering is important in a way that lists list items in order according to a certain criterion.

The type property specifies the type of order display. The order display is separated by numbers and letters, and the attribute values are as follows.

| Property Value | Description | Yes |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1 | Display by Numbers (default) | 1,2,3,... |
| a | Marked by the lowercase alphabet | a,b,c,... |
| A | Marked by the uppercase alphabet | A,B,C,... |
| i | Indication by lowercase Roman numerals | i,ii,iii,... |
| I | Marked by Roman numerals in uppercase | I, II, III, ... |

```undefined
<ol type="I">
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
</ol>

```

- HTML
- CSS

The start property specifies the starting number of the list. Property values must be numeric (integer) and are shown in the first list item. Specifying the starting number can also take advantage of the value property of the li element.

```html
<ol start="10">
<li>HTML</li>
<li value="100">CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
</ol>

```

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

If the start property of the ol element and the value property of the li element are duplicated, the value property takes precedence.

The reverse attribute is a newly added property in HTML5, which specifies the list in reverse order. By default, the list order is ascending, but the reverse property allows you to change the list order to descending order.

```html
<ol reversed="reversed" >
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
</ol>

```

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### LI Elements

The li element displays a list item.

- An item is a component of a list, and a list is a collection of items according to some criteria.
- It should be used in conjunction with the parent elements ol, ul, and menu.

The value property specifies the ordinal value of the list item. Ordinal value means the number of values representing the order. This property represents the order of list items, so it is only valid when used with the ol element.

```html
<ol>
<li>Grapes</li>
<li>Watermelon</li>
<li value="100">사과</li>
<li>Bae</li>
<li>Strawberry</li>
</ol>

```

The default value of the element ol is 1, and the value value can be used to set the start value.

- grape
- Watermelon
- apple
- ship
- Strawberry

### DL Elements

The dl element displays a definition list.

```html

</dl>

```

- Start and end of list <dl>
- Like an ordered list, items are listed in the order in which they are written, but the list is different in that it consists of two parts: the term and the description.
- Terms and descriptions do not always form one-on-one correspondence. One term can have multiple explanations, and vice versa, multiple terms can have one explanation.
- In HTML5, instead of the term "term"-description, the concept is extended to a relational list consisting of a set of zero or more names and values. The collection of names and values is defined as the definition of the terms and their definitions, the metadata attributes and their values, or any form of the names and values.

### DT Element

The dt element displays the definition term in the definition list.

- It is used only within the dl element and must be paired with the dd element.
- The definition list is used for the purpose of defining and explaining items, so the meaning of the subject and description may vary if the subject and description are changed. Therefore, the dt element must be in front of the dd element.
- The dt element can only contain text and cannot contain block-level elements such as the p and h elements.

### DD Element

The dd element displays the definition description in the definition list.

- It is used only within the dl element and must be paired with the dt element.
- The definition list is used for the purpose of defining and explaining items, so the meaning of the subject and description may vary if the subject and description are changed.
- The dd element can only contain text and cannot contain block-level elements such as p and h elements.

### HR Elements

The hr element exhibits horizontal lines, which represent visual changes.

```html
Once upon a time...</p>
<hr>
These days...</p>

```

- HTML5 has the meaning of a topic classification at the paragraph level. In other words, to enhance meaningful markups, hr elements are used to represent the boundaries between the subject and the subject.

### FIGURE ELEMENTS

The figure element is an element added to HTML5, which brings together pictures, illustration images, diagrams, code blocks, verse, and other forms of illustration to form blocks and include captions to clearly structure each other`s relationships.

- Since it can include child elements, various types of elements such as img, canvas, video, code elements can be grouped into the same theme.

| Internet Express | Firefox | Safari | Chrome | Opera |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| IE9 | FF4 | SF5, iOS4 | CH7, An2.1 | O11 |

### FIGCAPTION ELEMENTS

The figure element displays a caption for the figure element.

- The figure element can have only one figure capture element and can explicitly relate to each other by a parent-child relationship.

The figurecapture element is the title of the diagram and the alt attribute is the description of the diagram. In other words, the figure element is intended to display the title in the context provided with the chart, and the alt property is intended to display the chart in the absence of the chart.

```html
'<h2>Old HTML</h2>
="img src="book.jpg" alt="picture that cyclically represents the user experience course">
>Circular structure of user experience</p>

<h2>HTML5</h2>
<figure>
="img src="book.jpg" alt="picture that cyclically represents the user experience course">
£figcaption >Circular structure of user experience >
</figure>

```

### DIV Element

The div element displays document DIVision.

```html
<div id="wrap">
<div class="section">
<p>Contents</p>
</div>
</div>

```

- It is a general-purpose container that can bind contents without giving them any special meaning.
- It is useful when you simply need to divide the area for style sheets or script application.
- It can also include inline elements or text.

### PRE Element

The pre element displays pre-built text (PREformed text).

```html
<pre>
function sum(a, b) {
return(a+b)
}
</pre>

```

- Text is displayed in fixed-width fonts such as Courier, keeping spaces and ignoring wordwrap.
- It is used to express poems and computer codes.
