When you insert a video on YouTube in the iframe format, you sometimes experience a console error message. We look at the developer`s position on this and how to deal with it.

### Console Error Content

GET chrome-extension://boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd/cast_sender.js net::ERR_FAILED

The above error message was identified as an error occurring in Opera and Chrome browsers.(Unidentified because there`s no Safari browser for Windows)

### Causes of Occurrence

This error occurs when a document that inserts a YouTube video requests the required cast_sender.js file from Chromecast. Insert something when it meets certain conditions associated with Chrome`s extensions. Perhaps due to the lack of macanism such as such, related developers have not come up with appropriate measures.

### Countermeasures

- It is not an error in the document, so I just ignore it.
- Alternatively, install a chrome cast.
- If you are not satisfied with the installation of the chromecast, change the embedded to v from the YouTube address (e.g. `src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVCubhQ454c"). When changed, the UI changes to the old style as shown below, eliminating related errors.
