bind method

The function is invoked and executed immediately, but the bind method generates a Function object and returns it.

The bind method is divided into steps to create a new Function object and to call the generated Function object as a function.

It is supported by ES5.

In the first parameter, specify the object to reference with this when calling the Function object created by bind method as a function.

If not specified, it is considered a global object.

In the second parameter, specify the parameter to use when calling the Function object created by bind method as a function.

You can also specify parameters when calling the generated Function object as a function.

When you call a function object that you create with the parameters specified in the bind method, you merge the parameters that you specify and use as one parameter.

```js
var obj = {
value : 123,
get : function() {
return this.value;
}
};

console.log(obj.get()) // 123

var fnObj = obj.get.bind({value:456});
console.log(fnObj());
```
