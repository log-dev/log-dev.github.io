While using Windows for a long time, one day I looked into the folder on Drive C, and there were several folders created similar to _MEI42762. The pattern showed that the folder was increasing one by one a day, but it looked different from the occasional temporary files or by-products of Windows Update files that made the system messy.

Google found that it was a temporary folder created by Google Drive when Windows started. Currently, these folders are occurring in C:\ and are reported as bugs in Google Drive. However, there is no countermeasure yet, and it is necessary to use Google Drive by logging in and using it only when it is needed, and to repeat the shutdown. Temporary folders can be shut down and deleted from Google Drive.
