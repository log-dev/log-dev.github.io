Module Pattern

Before we look at the module pattern, let`s start with the term namespace.

Namespace refers to the creation of a single global object for an application or library and the addition of all functions, objects, and variables to the object without disturbing the global effective range.

For example, in a library such as jQuery, jQuery has a namespace and adds all the features within the jQuery name.

In other words, it gives the code a namespace and prevents name conflicts within the code as well as name conflicts with third-party code, such as another JavaScript library or widget that exists on the same page as this code.

We can use these Naispace patterns as patterns that collect only small functions, and we can mimic them as module patterns.

A module is a separation of parts of an entire application into independent code. The module is a collection of useful functions associated with it and, in large part, a library such as jQuery is also a module. And if you look at the jQuery API category classification, we provide APIs through css, core, ajax, etc., which also manages the category section by module and distributes the final build version. Of course, jQuery can be downloaded and used by users per module.

In JavaScript, the easiest way to implement a module is to use object literals.

```js
var module = {
key : 'value',
pulicMethod : function () {
}
}

```

The previous posting mentioned object literals as singletones. Just because the object literal representation is a single-toned pattern does not mean that it should not be a different pattern.

In other words, depending on what perspective the same code is viewed, it can be a different pattern. Object literals are either single-toned patterns in that they are one object, or module patterns in that they are independent modules.

The independent module must have all the internal variables and internal functions that it needs. As such, when you say you are creating an internal variable and an object with an internal function, you should use a closure.

The following is a code that implements a module pattern using a closure.

```js
var module = (function () {
/**
* --------------------------------
* Closure code implementing module pattern
* --------------------------------
*/
// Define members to be hidden
var privateKey = 0;
function privateMethod() {
return ++privateKey;
}
// Define members to be released (privileged methods)
return {
publickey : privateKey,
publicMethod : function () {
return privateMethod();
}
}
})();

console.log(module.publicMethod()); // 1
console.log (module.publicMethod()); // 2 (as a result of the closure')'
```

The module pattern is similar to a closure except that the return value is an object, not a function, and is automatically invoked. And there is a difference from the single-toned pattern in that it is a structure that can produce multiple instances.

When you execute the above code, the anonymous function is automatically invoked and the object returned by the anonymous function is assigned to the Module variable. /p>

Therefore, you can call module.publicMethod() as shown above. The code above is similar to singleton because it creates only one instance object.

However, you can create and use multiple instances by eliminating structures that are automatically called (self-invoking) as shown below.

Code that eliminates the auto-call structure.

```js
var Module = function () {
/**
* --------------------------------
* Closure code implementing module pattern
* --------------------------------
*/
// Define members to be hidden
var privateKey = 0;

function privateMethod() {
return ++privateKey;
}
// Define members to be released (privileged methods)
return {
publickey : privateKey,
publicMethod : function () {
return privateMethod();
}
}
};

// Create two instances
var obj1 = Module();
obj1.publicMethod(); // 1 출력
obj1.publicMethod(); // 2 출력

var obj2 = Module();
obj2.publicMethod(); // 1 출력
obj2.publicMethod(); // 2 출력
```

As shown above, when you define a Module function (immediate execution X) and call it up, you can create and use objects that are multiple instances.

Similar to a closure instance, but one difference is that the return value in the anonymous function inside returns an object, not a function.

### Advantages and disadvantages of module patterns

### To define a module default pattern:

```js
// 1. Set Namespace and Define Modules
var MyApp = {} // Global Object
MyApp.modules = {}

/*
2. Create a scope of disclosure (privileged method, etc.) and a scope of non-disclosure validity.
==> Return the object to be a module as an immediate execution function.
It contains an open interface to be provided to module users.
*/
MyApp.modules.libs = (function() {

// Private Properties
// Validity range (private member) such as var declaration and private method

// Public API (public, previlege member)
return {

};
}());
```
