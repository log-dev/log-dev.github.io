JavaScript Design Pattern - Namespace Pattern

The namespace reduces the number of global variables that your application needs, while avoiding name overlap without using excessive prefixes.

Although it is not embedded in JavaScript`s language grammar, namespace is a fairly easy function to implement.

### Namespace Pattern

The pattern of creating a single global object (ideally creating only one) and adding all of its functions to the global effective range, usually for applications or libraries, is called namespace patterns.

The following example is an anti-pattern.

```js
Before modifying: 5 global variables
// Warning: Anti-pattern

// 2 constructor functions
function Parent() {}
function Child() {}

// 1 variable
var some_var = 1;

// 2 objects
var module1 = {};
module.data = {
a : 1,
b : 2
};
var module2 = {}
```

To refactivate the above code, you first create an application-only global object, then MYAPP.

Then change all functions and variables to the property of this global object.

The following example is the result of refactoring.

```js
// After modification: 1 global variable

// Global Objects
var MYAPP = {};

// constructor
MYAPP.Parent = function() {};
MYAPP.Child = function() {};

// Variables
MYAPP.some_var = 1;

// Object Container
MYAPP.modules = {};

// Add the objects into the container.
MYAPP.modules.module1 = {};
MYAPP.modules.module1.data = { a : 1, b : 2 };
MYAPP.modules.module2 = {};
```

You can also choose the name of the global namespace object from the application name or the name of the library, the domain name, or the company name.

The naming convention is often capitalized on all global object names, so that code readers can notice it.(Note that this rule is also used to write constants.)

This pattern specifies a namespace for the code and prevents name conflicts with third-party code, such as JavaScript libraries or widgets that exist on the same page as this code, as well as name conflicts within the code.

It can be applied to a variety of tasks and is a highly recommended pattern. However, the following disadvantages also exist:

- Since all variables and functions need to be prefixed, the overall code amount is slightly higher and therefore the size of the files that need to be downloaded increases.
- Because there is only one global instance, any single part of the code is modified to modify the global instance. In other words, the rest of the functions are inherited updated.
- The overlapping and lengthening of names also results in long and slow search operations to determine the properties.

### Universal Naispace

As the complexity of the program increases and each part of the code is separated into separate files and optionally included, it is dangerous to assume that a code is the first to define a particular namespace or its internal property.

The property that you are trying to add to the namespace may already exist and the content may be overwritten.

Therefore, it is best to determine whether it already exists before creating a namespace or adding a property.

Take a look at the following examples:

```js
// Hazardous Pattern
var MYAPP = {};

// Improved pattern
if(typeof MYAPP === 'undefined') {
var MYAPP = {};
}
// or write shorter. or shorter.
var MYAPP = MYAPP || {};
```

This added verification can result in a significant amount of duplicate code.

For example, to define MYAPP.modules.module2, you will need to verify each step`s object and property, resulting in three duplicates of the code.

Therefore, it is convenient to create reusable functions that are responsible for the actual work of namespace generation.

You can create these reusable namespace generation functions as namespace() and use them as follows:

```js
Use the namespace generation function `//.
MYAPP.namespace('MYAPP.modules.module2');

// The above namespace function will return the following results:
var MYAPP = {
modules : {
module2 : {}
}
};
```

Now, let`s try to implement a namespace that can return the above results.

The following methods do not break existing code because they are not overwritten if the namespace exists:

```js
ar MYAPP = MYAPP || {};

MYAPP.namespace = function (ns_string) {
var parts = ns_string.split('.'),
parent = MYAPP,
i;

// initially remove duplicate global object names.
if(parts[0] === MYAPP) {
parts = parts.slice(1);
}

for (i = 0; i < parts.length; i += 1) {
// Create a property if it does not exist.
if(typeof parent[parts[i]] === 'undefined') {
parent[parts[i]] = {};
}
parent = parent[parts[i]];
}
return parent;
};
```

The above code can be used as follows:

```js
Assign a return value to the local variable.
var module2 = MYAPP.namespace('MYAPP.modules.module2');
module2 === MYAPP.modules.module2; // true
```
