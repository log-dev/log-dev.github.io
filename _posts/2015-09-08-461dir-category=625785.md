We`re looking at plug-ins that set access, and they`re one of the free plug-ins that many people recommend, so let`s look at them.

### User Access Manager 설명

A plug-in that lets you manage access to posts, pages, and files. Create a user group, insert the registered user, and set permissions for the group. From now on, the post/page will be accessible and writable only by designated groups. This plug-in is useful if you need a personal area in your own area or blog, or if you want others to be able to write anywhere, not just in your blog.

- creating and removing user groups
- Separated access settings for readers and editors - readers and editors are part of WordPress permission settings
- Set Access by User Group
- Access Settings by Post Category
- You can set the title of the post/page to be displayed if you do not have access.
- Post/page statements (content) to be displayed in the absence of access may be established.
- Optionally, login form (shown if you do not have access)
- You can set up comments (comments) that will be shown if you do not have access.
- Hide Full Posts/Pages
- Hide Page from Navigation
- Redirect to another page (shown if you do not have access)
- Recursive locking of post/page
- Restrict access to uploaded files
- Full integration into the Administrators panel
- Multilingual Support
- RSS Feed Protection
- Set access to IP addresses
- Plugin-API is used to use User Access Manager for plug-ins or to extend other plug-ins.

You can access your own WordPress and search the plug-in to the User Access Manager to install it.

### User Access Manager FAQ

Any post/page that is not in a user access group is accessible to all users. Posts/pages can be placed in groups by themselves, category or recursively (most pages).

This example provides an overview:

- Posts: Post1, Post2
- Users: User1 (admin), User2 (subscriber), User3 (subscriber)

Groups:

- Group1: Users: User2, User3 | Posts: Post1 | Role affiliation: subscriber
- Group2: Users: User3 | Posts: Post2 | Role affiliation: -

Access:

- Post1: User1 is accessible because it is an administrator, User2 belongs to a group and is a subscriber, and User3 is a subscriber (all subscribers in this group are accessible!)
- Post2: User1 is accessible because it is an administrator, User3 is accessible because it belongs to a group (no role has been given because only group members are accessible!)

- You can disable the lock file in the User Access Manager (UAM) settings.
- Media files on the post can be replaced. We just delete the existing link and re-insert it (a new task link is created).

### User Access Manager Usage

After installing the plug-in, a menu called UAM is created when you access WordPress`s Manager panel.

This menu allows you to set up users and user groups. This allows you to add user groups and set access rights for users in those groups.

Add user group :

- User group name : Enter the user group name to be created in this field, which is used as an identifier.
- User group description : field to enter a description of the group.
- IP range: When an IP address is entered in this field, it is included in the management of this group without logging in. The IP address range is written as the "From" to "To" address and uses ";" as the separator, and allows for non-range IPs. For example, 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.1;192.168.0.20-192.168.0.30
- Read access: To set read permissions, you can set only group users can be set.
- Write access: To set write permissions, only group users or all can be set.
- Role operation: You can set one of the role (authorization) settings provided by WordPress.

After adding a group, a new table is created as follows.

If you have an existing user, you can edit the user in the Administrators panel. User Groups are added to the edit, and you can select the group to place in Setup user groups. You can also specify groups when you add new users.

This is where detailed settings are made for posts, pages, files, and other access rights.

Post settings :

Set the behavior of locked posts

- Hide complete posts: Setting this value to "Yes" hides the post from users who do not have access. In other words, you see a message that the posts cannot be found as if they do not exist. Setting to "No" allows other messages to be printed according to the settings below.
- Hide post title: If this value is set to Yes, users without access will see the phrase entered in the "Post table" field below. Setting to "No" exposes the circle title of the post.
- Post title: Users who do not have access to this field display the values entered.
- Show post content before <--more--> tag: <--more--gt; Shows post content before the tag and after the phrase entered in "Post content" below. Without <--more--gt;, the entry in "Post content" is shown.
- Post content: If the user does not have access, this field displays what he or she has written. You can also add a login form by adding the keyword `[LOGIN_FORM]. This form is displayed in one post, otherwise a link is displayed.
- Hide post comments: Setting this value to "Yes" will show the value entered in the "Post comment text" below.
It is explained that but it works the opposite way. If yes, all comments are hidden.
- Post comment text: If the user does not have access, the text entered in this field will be shown.
- Allow post comments: Set to "Yes" to allow users to comment on locked posts.
It is explained that, but everyone succeeds in writing comments. Do you need any other settings?

Page settings :

Setting the behavior of a locked page

- Hide complete pages: Setting this value to "Yes" hides the page from users who do not have access. The page is also hidden in the navigation.
- Hide page title: If this value is set to Yes, users who do not have access to it will show the entered statement in the "Page table" field below.
- Page title: Users who do not have access to this field display the values entered.
- Page content : If the user does not have access, this field displays what he or she has written. You can also add a login form by adding the keyword `[LOGIN_FORM]. This form is displayed on a single page, otherwise a link is displayed.
- Hide page comments: Setting this value to "Yes" will show the value entered in the "Page comment text" below.
- Page comment text: If the user does not have access, the text entered in this field will be shown.
- Allow page comments: Set to "Yes" to allow users to comment on a locked page.

File settings :

Set behavior for files

- Lock files: When this value is set to Yes, it is locked by .htaccess and only users with access can download the file.

When enabled, the plug-in will overwrite the `.htaccess` file in the upload folder if it is already in use to protect the file. In addition, without an active permlink, the upload directory is protected by an arbitrary password `.htaccess`, and all existing media files inserted in the previous post/page will no longer work. Existing posts/pages should be updated (not required if permlink is enabled).

Authors settings :

Here you can find the setting for the author.

- Authors always has access to open posts/pages: "Yes" always gives the author full access to his or her own post or page.
- Authors can add content to their own groups: If set to "Yes", the author can restrict the content by adding it to the group.
- Minimum user role with full access: All users with the same or higher role specified here have full rights.

Other settings :

You can find all the other settings here.

- Protect Feed: Set to "Yes" to protect the entire feed.
- Hide identity categories: Set to "Yes" to hide empty categories that contain children or non-children.
- Redirect user: Sets what happens when an unauthorized user visits a post/page.
- Lock recursive: When set to "Yes", locks all child posts/pages on the post/page if the user does not have access to the parent page.
- Show admin hint at Posts: When set to "Yes", the phrase entered in the "Admin hint text" field below is shown after the post/page. Posts/pages provide hints about being locked when you log in as an administrator when you visit your blog.
- Admin hint text: A phrase shown after a post/page.

Initialize the User Access Manager.

- Reset User Access Manager: Set to Yes and press reset button.
