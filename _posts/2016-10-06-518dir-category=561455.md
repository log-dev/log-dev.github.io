There used to be a lot of tools to make ISO files bootable for Windows installation, but most of these programs were expensive or one of the various functions, so they were complicated and didn`t repeat the same process for a long time, so I forgot how to use them. The following is a formal documentation from Microsoft, and we`re providing some answers, so we think it`s a more stable approach, and it`s very simple.

### Windows USB/DVD Download Tool 소개

Windows 7/8 ISO files are created as bootable files by running the Windows USB/DVD Download Tool and copying them to a DVD or USB. Windows installation can be carried out on this generated USB or DVD.

Although official documents and download sites are different, they are linked to Microsoft.
