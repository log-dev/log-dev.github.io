The default phpMyAdmin setting in XAMPP is accessible only from localhost. For security reasons, learn how to modify them if they need to be opened.

### phpMyAdmin settings

If you connect to the domain/phpmyadmin, such as the image above, you will encounter a message that you do not have access. The exact address is located in xampp/apache/conf/extra/httpd-xampp.conf, which is a hint that it can be set up in `xampp.conf`.

```undefined
#
# New XAMPP security concept
#
<LocationMatch "^/(?i:(?:xampp|security|licenses|phpmyadmin|webalizer|server-status|server-info))">
Require local
ErrorDocument 403 /error/XAMPP_FORBIDDEN.html.var
</LocationMatch>


```

The line <LocationMatch:^(?i:(?:xampp|...)> lists the affected ones. This means that all of the above listed lists are only accessible from localhost under the influence of `Require local`, and show ErrorDocument 403 if not localhost`s connection.

If you delete the phpmyadmin part, you can access it.

```undefined
<LocationMatch "^/(?i:(?:xampp|security|licenses|webalizer|server-status|server-info))">

```

Let`s note that annotating the `Require local` part will allow access from the outside, but also release everything else.
