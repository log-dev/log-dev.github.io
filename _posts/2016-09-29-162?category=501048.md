Class-based (general language) versus prototype-based comparisons

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/267C213657EC8EDF3B)

### Class-based (general language)

```js
'/* Step 1: Define Class */
public class Prisoner {
public int setence = 4;
public int probation = 2;
public string name;
public string id;

/* Step 2: Define class constructors*/
public Prisoner(string name, string id) {
this.name = name;
this.id = id;
}
}

/* Step 3: Create Object */
Prisoner firstPrisoner = new Prisoner("Joe", "12A");
Prisoner secondPrisoner = new Prisoner("Sam", "2BC");
```

### Prototype-based (JavaScript)

```js
'/* Step 1: Define a prototype object */
var proto = {
sentence : 2,
probation : 2
};

/* Step 2: Define object constructors */
var Prisoner = function(name, id) {
this.name = name;
this.id = id;
}

/* Step 3: Constructor to Prototype Object */
Prisoner.prototype = proto;

/* Step 4: Create Object */
var firstPrisoner = new Prisoner("Joe", "12A");
var secondPrisoner = new Prisoner("Joe", "12A");
```

Both methods first created object templates. In class-based programming, these templates are called classes, and in prototype-based programming, they are called prototype objects, but both templates have the same purpose.

It acts as a framework for creating objects.

You created a constructor twice, and in a class-based language, you define the constructor inside the class so that you can clearly see which class the constructor belongs to when you create the object. JavaScript requires a step (step 3) to connect the two together because the object constructor is set outside the prototype. Finally, create an object.
