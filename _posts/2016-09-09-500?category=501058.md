Arrangement

Array is used to store a lot of data in sequence.

An array has a repository that has been assigned an index number called an element and can access the element in the array to read the assigned value.

When you need to keep a large amount of data, you can use an array to efficiently manage your data.

- A bowl that can hold multiple data in a variable or a piece of data that can handle multiple variables at once.
- Create with brackets [] and enter materials separated by commas inside
- Managing multiple variables as index numbers

### Create Array

Array can be created in two ways: `[]` or `new Array()`.

```js
var arr1 = [];
var arr2 = new Array();
```

assigning values to array elements

You can assign values through the index of an array element or create an array and assign values at the same time.

Here`s how to assign values to elements after you create an array:

```js
varray = []; // Create Array
array[0] = Data 1; // Add Data Element
array[1] = data 2;
array[2] = data 3;

var fruits = [];
fruits[0] = '사과';
fruits[1] = '배';
fruits[2] = 'Banana';'
```

Create an `[]array` and assign it to the variable fruits. The values are assigned to elements 0~2 index of the array through the variable fruits.

Because the index of the array starts at zero, you assigned an apple to index 0.

To assign values to an element at the same time as you create an array:

```js
'var fruits = ["Apples", "Pears", "Bananas"];'
```

After creating the array `[]`, the values were added to the three elements in order. And you assigned an array to the variable fruits.

Read value for array element

If you have assigned values to an array element by index, you can put the index in [] after the array to access the element and retrieve the values.

```js
var fruits = ["Apples", "Pears", "Banana"];

console.log(fruits[0]);
console.log(fruits[1]);
console.log(fruits[2]);

```

The number in the array symbol is called an index.

Obtain the number of elements in an array (check Array Length)

The number of elements added to the array can be obtained through the `length` property.

```js
var fruits = ["Apples", "Pears", "Banana"];

var len = fruits.length;
console.log(len); // total number of elements is 3'
```

You can define different types of elements in an array.

```js
var array = [273, "String", true, function() {}, {}, [273, 103]];
console.log(array); 
```

Methods in an array

Arrays can have many elements, so they need a means to manage a large number of elements.

There are many methods defined in the arrangement by that means.

- `join` – Return to String (Original Change X)
- `reverse` – change backwards
- `sort` – Array Alignment
- `concat` – Array Ear Attachment (Original Change X)
- `slice` – Partial Array Return (Original Change X)
- `splice` – Delete/Add
- `push`, `pop` – add/delete last
- `shift`, `unshift` – add/delete front

Object

JavaScript is an object-based language.

The object has a function or property.

For example, TV has features such as turn on, turn off, mute, volume up, volume down, etc.

Each object called TV has various functions, and all objects in the real world are called objects.

The programmatically approaching and grafting of objects in the real world is also described as objects in the programming language.

Therefore, JavaScript is an object-oriented language, and various objects exist and the arrangement corresponds to the object.

And JavaScript has many different functions, such as turning on the TV, which is called a method.

TV Objects

- `Method`: turn on(); turn off(); increase volume(); decrease volume();
- `Property` : Width; Height; Color; Weight;

### To create an Object

Objects can be created in two ways: `new object()` or `{}.

```js
var obj = new Object();

varobj = {}; // Create Object
// obj.a = Data 1; // Add Data Element
// obj.b = data 2;
// obj.c = data 3;
```

Add and Read Properties to Objects

You can add properties or methods regardless of the order of the object.

Properties and method names are user-specified, so they are the same as variables.

Use the `." operator when creating or accessing a property of an object.

```js
var person = {};
person.age = 30;
person.sex = '남자';
person.birthday = "12월 25일";

console.log(person.age); // The property name allows you to read the value of the property.
console.log(person.sex);
console.log(person.birthday);
```

It is also possible to add properties to an object as soon as it is created.

```js
var person = {
age : 30,
"Boy,"
"December 25th"
};

console.log(person.age); // The property name allows you to read the value of the property.
console.log(person.sex);
console.log(person.birthday);
```

You created the person object and added the property at the same time, and you created the object and you created the object `{}` Put the Property inside.

And the property is divided into commas (,).

To add and invoke methods on an Object

The method of adding a method to an object is similar to the property.

```js
var person = {
age : 30,
"Boy,"
"December 25th"
getAge : function () {
return this.age;
}
};

var age = person.getAge();
console.log(age);
```

Declares a function as a value.

This is what you should pay attention to here. where this points to the person object.

Invoking a method causes objects with the method to cross over through `this`.

That`s why `this` reads the value of the edge property and returns it.

These development patterns are frequently used in jQuery or JavaScript development.

Function

A function is a form of using or reusing a pre-built phrase.

It reduces repetitive tasks by prewriting phrases that are used primarily repeatedly and calling them when needed, which helps reduce development efficiency and the amount of code.

### Declare and recall functions

The function can be declared in the following ways:

```js
function send() {
console.log('transfer');
}
send();
```

In the code above, `function` means a declaration to use a function.

Send is the name of the function and can be defined by the user. You can think of it as the same meaning as the name of the variable.

The name of the function is followed by a `{}` next to the `()` and a syntax is written in it as an executable.

The execution statement is executed when the function is called.

factor value, parameter

You can set parameters within `()` while declaring a function.

You can pass over the factor value within the declared function `()` and pass the value through the parameter to the syntax in the function.

```js
var a = 10;
var b = 20;

function add(v1, v2) {
var sum = v1 + v2;
return sum;
}

var sum = add(a, b);
console.log(sum);
```

The function `add()` is declared and the parameters v1, v2 are handed over within the function `().

It passes the value of variables a, b to the factor value while calling the function `add().

When the function is called, the value of the factor passed over is received from the parameter and processed.

Return value

When a function is called, you can reverse the value to the syntax in which it was called.

It`s a return that plays that role.

The return value provides flexibility in developing the program.

jQuery 란?

The function of JavaScript is to define a set of execution statements within a function and then call them whenever necessary to use them.

JQuery is a library of JavaScript that makes it easier to use some of the inconveniences and challenges of JavaScript by providing these various functions to users.

The following are the improvements in the J-Query.

- Troubleshooting compatibility issues

JavaScript is less compatible (cross-browsing), and for this compatibility, J-Query helps each browser to consistently use different implementations.

- Easily and conveniently implement animation effects

To implement the animation effect with JavaScript, we had to use a lot of code, and it took a lot of time to develop it.

However, J-Query can easily implement animation and provides methods that support various effects.

- Easier navigation

The jQuery Selector takes and reflects the selector of the CSS, making it easy for users who are familiar with CSS grammar.

This API is convenient enough to access and use CSS quickly without experiencing it.

### Handling events

You can define an event as a response to a particular aspect of a user`s

For example, an event is an event that responds to several actions on a website, such as clicking or raising a specific element with a mouse, pressing the keyboard, or changing the size of a browser`s window.

And when an event occurs, executing a JavaScript execution statement is called an event handler.

That is, JavaScript code is executed when an event occurs.
