CSS designs often require multiple columns to be aligned at the same height. CSS3 is a simple problem to solve, but if you think of a browser that doesn`t support it, you`ll need a lot of thought, so let`s summarize how to solve it.

### Utilize properties that automatically align the height of a column

Some of the CSS attributes include automatically matching the height of a column between child elements of the same parent.

It`s a very easy task with flex properties. If `display: flex` is set for parent element that surrounds target element and the order of target element is set, it can be completed easily. However, the supporting grammar was replaced once in the middle, and cross-browsing problems occur due to problems that are not supported in older browsers.

IE will be able to determine whether to use this property on the assumption that it will work normally in accordance with the recently revised grammar from version 11 or higher, Android 4.4, and that the rest of the browsers are always up to date. For additional information on flex, please refer to the CSS Flex properties.

Although it is past the time to use `table` tag for design, CSS attributes that mimic the characteristics of this tag are still used. Although it is not a real table, if `display: table` is set to parent element and `display: table-cell` is set to child element, it works like a table in one row.

Because the `table` attribute works with IE8 and later browsers, this method can also be nominated if IE7 is not considered. However, it should be remembered that elements that have table properties, just like tables, may be subject to restrictions on CSS design.

### Using CSS Tricks

There are several CSS tricks that have been used from the past to the present to make the heat look the same in height.

If you use a fixed width, you can easily access it. It is to create a background image that seems to be divided into the background of the parent element or the `body` element and repeat it based on the y-axis. In fact, each child element has a different height.

One of the limitations is that it is difficult to respond to flexible widths like `width: 80%`, and several background images may need to be prepared to respond similarly.

```html
<div id="wrapper">

<div id="content">
<p>contentr</p>
</div>

<div id="side">
<p>side</p>
</div>

</div>

```

The CSS is simple and utilizes the floating property to set the width of the child elements to match the width divided by the background image. The `overflow` property is only used to clear the floating property, but it does not matter if other clear techniques are used.

```css
#wrapper {
width: 960px;
margin: 0 auto;
background: url ("background image").png") repeat-y;
overflow: hidden;
}

#content {
float: left;
width: 6200px;
}

#side {
float: right;
width: 340px;
}

```

It is almost similar to the above method, but can be used as a way for side elements to project background colors of parent elements instead of background images. However, there are restrictions on the assumption that the main element where the content will be located will always be higher than the side area and the use of margin elements should be avoided.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="266" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/uzugoer/embed/epvPzg?height=266&amp;theme-id=17120&amp;slug-hash=epvPzg&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=uzugoer&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_epvPzg"></iframe>

This method also assumes that the target element is always smaller than either. It is a way to expand height by using negative margin values and secure contents in the field of view by using padding values again. Setting the "overflow: hidden" of the parent element is important, and if it is not set, the extended element of the negative margin will be exposed according to the entered value.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="266" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/uzugoer/embed/Zbeqee?height=266&amp;theme-id=17120&amp;slug-hash=Zbeqee&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=uzugoer&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_Zbeqee"></iframe>

Let`s find out how to satisfy both cross-browsing and fluid height changes, regardless of whether the height of either column is high or low, although it is more complex as the last method using the background of the parent element.

This method requires two elements that surround children to separate the background of the main area from the background of the side area. Of course, if you use the background of the body element, you don`t need two container elements.

```html
<div id="wrapper">
<div id="inner">

<div id="content">메인</div>

<div id="side">사이드</div>

</div>
</div>

```

1. Float container elements (parent elements) and columns (child elements).

```css
#wrapper { float: left; }
#inner { float: left; }
#content {float: left; width: 80%; }
#side {float: left; width: 20%; }

```

The direction of the float is not important, only to take advantage of the fact that the plotted containers and content always have the same height. In other words, if the plotted `#wrapper` container and its children are plotted, they will all have the same height.

2. Specify the background color for each of the two containers.

```css
#wrapper {
float: left;
background: pink;
}
#inner {
float: left;
background: silver;
}

```

The background color of the side column is set to `#inner` and the background color of the contents that will appear on the main page is set to `#wrapper`. (The location of the background can change somehow depending on how you think about it.)

3. Adjust the inner container to hold the mark where the main and side are located.

```css
#inner {
float: left;
background: silver;
position: relative;
left: 80%;
}

```

Because `#wrapper`, which is a container outside of a stack, is covered by `#inner` container, there is no background color of contents. To solve this problem, `position: relative` is given to inner containers and only move the width of side columns so that they can be seen. In this example, the width of the side column was 20%, so it was moved 80% and excluded from the screen.

4. Return the main and side columns to their original state.

Move the inner container to restore the skewed area and return it as much as it is moved.

```css
#content {
float: left;
width: 80%;
position: relative;
right: 80%;
}
#side {
float: left;
width: 20%;
position: relative;
right: 80%;
}

```

Similarly, `position: relative` is given and internal containers are moved back as long as they are moved. This ensures that the screen is in its normal position.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="266" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/uzugoer/embed/avJRKG?height=266&amp;theme-id=17120&amp;slug-hash=avJRKG&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=uzugoer&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_avJRKG"></iframe>

It is important to understand the principles of this method, only to show one example. Using this, one can devise methods such as changing the width of one side of the column only (margin use) while keeping the width fixed.

### Leverage Scripts

MatchHeight - As discussed in the height uniformity between elements, you can also use plug-ins to match the height of columns or write directly related code. It would be a way to obtain the height values of the desired elements and set the height to the height of the high side after comparison. However, when using scripts like this, if there are elements that dynamically change in height or insert, the code will need to be updated or the delay time added according to the situation.

Regarding this, please study the method presented in Make Sidebar Same Height as Content Div to be Equal.

There are other methods other than those mentioned above, but most of them solve problems within the above methods. It seems that it will be unified in a simple way using the flex attribute at a time when a little more time has passed and support for older IE is not considered.
