RHEL6 employs anacron in the execution of routine tasks. It is also applied in his public distribution, CentOS6.

### anacron

Anacron is not intended to run a task at the exact time, but rather to run daily, weekly, or monthly tasks at the "appropriate timing".

RHEL5 used the cron task to run regular tasks every hour, or every day, every week, and every month. Specifically /etc/cron.hourly/, /etc/cron.daily/, /etc/cron.Place shell scripts running tasks in directories such as weekly/, /etc/cron.monthly/ or earlier.

In RHEL5, /etc/crontab is set as shown below.

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
MAILTO=root
HOME=/

# run-parts
01 * * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.hourly
02 4 * * * root run-parts /etc/cron.daily
22 4 * * 0 root run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
42 4 1 * * root run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

```

If the server is down and restarted, cron is likely to have a backlog of tasks that did not run during the interrupted period, and if a guest OS, RHEK5, starts working on a single physical server in a server virtualization environment by Linux KVM, the load on the physical server is likely to be concentrated.

Due to the above problems, it is necessary to change the setting of /etc/crontab to distribute the working time.

To avoid this problem, RHEL6 has been changed to run regular daily, weekly, and monthly tasks using anacron instruction rather than cron. As default, the setup file of RHEL6`s anacron command is located in /etc/anacrontab.

```bash
cat /etc/anacrontab

# /etc/anacrontab: configuration file for anacron
# See anacron(8) and anacrontab(5) for details.

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
MAILTO=root

# the maximal random delay added to the base delay of the jobs
RANDOM_DELAY=45

# the jobs will be started during the following hours only
START_HOURS_RANGE=3-22

#period in days delay in minutes job-identifier command
1 5 cron.daily nice run-parts /etc/cron.daily
7 25 cron.weekly nice run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
@monthly 45 cron.monthly nice run-parts /etc/cron.monthly

```

The cron task is run regularly by the resident daemon crond, but anacron is not a daemon. If there is a task that requires execution at the timing when someone explicitly executed anacron command, it executes the task.

When a task is executed, it writes the date of the last task by writing down the date in the file /var/spool/anacron/ <job-identifier> specified as `job-identifier`.

```bash
ls -la /var/spool/anacron

Total 20
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 2013-05-28 01:54 .
drwxr-xr-x. 8 root root 4096 2013-05-28 01:54 ..
-rw-------. 1 root root 9 2013-07-04 03:09 cron.daily
-rw-------. 1 root root 9 2013-07-02 18:21 cron.monthly
-rw-------. 1 root root 9 2013-07-02 18:01 cron.weekly

```

```bash
cat cron.daily
```

When anacron is re-executed, the task is re-executed if the date `period in days` or higher has elapsed from the last task execution date. In the above case, three run-parts commands will be executed exactly daily, weekly, and monthly.

Anacron is executed in RHEL6 using cron operation. The anacron command is executed at 0anacron every hour by shell script 0anacron below /etc/cron.hourly.

```bash
 cat 0anacron

#!/bin/bash
#in case file doesn't exist
if test -r /var/spool/anacron/cron.daily; then
day=`cat /var/spool/anacron/cron.daily`
fi
if [ `date +%Y%m%d` = "$day" ]; then
exit 0;
fi

# in case anacron is already running,
# there will be log (daemon won't be running twice).
if test -x /usr/bin/on_ac_power; then
/usr/bin/on_ac_power
```

It should be noted that in this method, the execution interval for each task is fixed, but the execution time of the task is not specifically fixed. For example, running a server that has been stalled for a long time will run all tasks at the first 01 minute timing. It is also intended to specify the time zone to allow the task to run as `START_HOURS_RANGE`.

It is only allowed to run from 3 a.m. to 22 a.m. above. At this point, the task actually runs after as much time as specified in `delay in minutes` at the time when the task with anacron is attempted to run, and the task is distributed.

The characteristics of cron and anacron are as follows.

- The task is executed at the specified time in units of days, hours, minutes, and seconds of the week.
- There is no function to rerun tasks that are not executed, such as when the server is stopped at a specified time.
(need to wait until the next specified time)
- There are multiple job settings such as /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/ or less, and crontab files for each user.
- The daemon process (crond) resides and runs the task at a specified time.

- Specifies the interval at which the task runs on a daily basis.
(The frequency of execution at least once a day is not fixed, and the time of execution cannot be specified explicitly.)
- Only /etc/anacrontab can be set, but no one can set the job except the root user.
- The execution timing of the task is randomly added to the extended time.
- Prepare a separate configuration to run the anacron command on a regular basis because the daemon process does not exist.
(The command to execute anacron at every 01 minute of cron is added by default.)
- If the server is suspended for a long time, the necessary work can be done immediately after the server runs.
