### Introducing Poedit

Poedit is an editor that translates applications or sites (using gettext). Thanks to a non-distracted approach, it helps transform quickly and easily.

- You can create translations for any software or website that uses Gettext. Gettext is widely used in many programming languages and many projects.
- Gettext can sometimes be tricky. Although it can cause problems by adding `%` by mistake, it checks and warns about these common problems.
- Poedit comes with built-in translation memory to help translate quickly. We remember past translations and make suggestions for similar texts and learn frequently used strings.

### WordPress Translation

I bring the PO file that I want to translate. WordPress native language files exist in wp-content/languages, and plug-in language files often exist in their plug-in directories, such as lang or language.

We proceed with the assumption that there are parts that we want to install and modify the Korean version of WordPress.

- Call in wp-content/language/ko_KR.po.
- Use the Ctrl + F key to find the desired word.
- Translation: Put the phrase you want in the part.
- After saving, verify that the MO file has been created. If it is not automatically created, check "Automatically compile MO files when saving" in File > Preferences and try to save them again.
- If WordPress is already uploaded in your web account, try to overwrite the PO file and MO file in the same location.
