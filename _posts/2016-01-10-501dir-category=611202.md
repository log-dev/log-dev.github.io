If an upgrade to Windows 10 fails for some reason, it will be blind. From worrying about the old data to blaming yourself for the old windows. And the resentment against Microsoft. I gathered information about the error solution.

### To verify the error code:

Windows notifies you of the error code when an error occurs. The following is an example of an error code that occurred when I experienced a Windows 10 upgrade failure.

During the upgrade, it was restored to the previous Windows as shown below.

The error code 800706FB was known, but no search results were found.

> I created more than about 30Gb of free space on the HDD and upgraded again, and the Windows 10 upgrade was successful without errors. The space required by Windows 10 is about 3Gb of free space, but after successful upgrade, when I looked at the Windows.old file, it occupied as much as 20Gb of space. Shouldn't we expect the amount of free space that Windows.old will create?

### Error Resolution

Typically, Windows 10 upgrades and installation errors are provided, but errors do not occur within that scope. Search by the search term "Windows 10 upgrade error" and you will encounter a variety of errors.

If other error codes occur, please refer to the article in the Windows 10 installation error summary.
