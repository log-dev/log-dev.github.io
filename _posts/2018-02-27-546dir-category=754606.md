Learn how to change the color of the WSL terminal. We`ll also use ColorTool, which simplifies the way and provides basic Windows terminals.

### WSL terminal like Ubuntu.

The Ubuntu distribution terminal (console) used as WSL is used to switch interfaces by matching colors and fonts like Ubuntu. In fact, if you open the terminal while installing WSL, it is a command prompt (CMD) on Windows, so if you are using native Linux, the transition of the interface is more immersive.

Terminals running on Windows can change settings using features provided by Windows.

If you change the default value rather than the attribute, the CMD window as well as the WSL terminal will change, so let`s choose according to the symbol. Here, we only want to change Ubuntu WSL, so we run Ubuntu WSL registered with the Windows app to change the terminal only.

When the window opens as shown below, enter the Color - Screen Background - Slot - RGB color value.

Enter the RGB values for each slot as shown below.

Ubuntu is distributing official fonts, so it may be possible to download and install them, but font changes are not normally made in terminals (console) such as CMD, PowerShell, and WSL. It is not saved and changed to the terminal roll base of Hangeul Windows.

Related issues are being addressed at https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/757. This is a problem that occurs in language systems that use certain locales, such as Korean, Chinese, and Japanese, and there are alternative ways to change the registry. In relation to this, information can also be obtained through search, but it seems better to just install and replace mono-type fonts that Windows acknowledges before the patches are formally addressed. Download and install the font of Bitstream Vera Sans Mono below.

Select the properties in the terminal and select the Font tab. Try selecting the desired font and size, exit the terminal, and try running it again. If a font is not recognized by the Windows terminal, it changes back to the default font at re-execution.

The terminal that completed the change is as follows.

### Windows Console Colortool

Microsoft is officially deploying Windows Console-related tools.

Let`s go to the downloaded folder and open the CMD window.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/9990AF495A8AA76114)

If you type `colortool` and call help, you can see that it is in the same usage format as `colortool.exe [Option] schema name`.

```undefined
C:\MyConfig\colortool> colortool

Usage:
colortool.exe [option] <schemename>

```

The colortool folder is enclosed with the schema folder in it `xxxx.You can see the files called `termcolors` by typing the xxx part under the schema name.

```undefined
colortool.exe deuteranopia
```

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/995594445A8AB5A315)

If you find the schema you want, you can save it by pressing the right mouse > property at the top of the terminal and clicking OK in the floating window. As you saw above, let`s change the font.

In the above example, the CMD window was accessed and set by Windows Explorer, so if the setting is stored only for CMD, Win + R and `cmd` input, and a shortcut icon is created and executed separately, the CMD must be applied separately. When this is annoying, using the colortool option `-b` will change the default value and the current terminal, so everything that runs the terminal will be applied collectively.

```undefined
colortool.exe -b solarized_dark
```

As you can see in the scheme folder, `xxx.Other schemas work in the form of `termcolors`. For example, the schemas provided by iTerm2-Color-Schemes can also be downloaded and placed in the Schemes folder. Many other places that use color schemes will also find themed schemas.
