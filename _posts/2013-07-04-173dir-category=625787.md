### Enable numeric permalink

If a number (`/archives/%post_id%`) is used as a permalink on a website, the Apache setup file must be modified as follows:

```undefined
vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

# Control access to UserDir directories. The following is an example
# for a site where these directories are restricted to read-only.
#
#<Directory /home/*/public_html>
# AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
# Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec
# <Limit GET POST OPTIONS>
# Order allow,deny
# Allow from all
# </Limit>
# <LimitExcept GET POST OPTIONS>
# Order deny,allow
# Deny from all
# </LimitExcept>
#</Directory>
<Directory /home/*/public_html>
AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec
<Limit GET POST OPTIONS>
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Limit>
</Directory>

```

### Apache to Php Interworking

For php interaction with Apache, modify the file /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf as follows:

```undefined
vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf

# Uncomment the following line to allow PHP to pretty-print .phps
# files as PHP source code:
#
AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

```

### Using .htaccess

The .htaccess file must be changed to AllowOveride All in the < or WordPress directories.
