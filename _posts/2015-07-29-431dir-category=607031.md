It seems that translating into Korean has made it more difficult. The backface-visibility property allows you to modify awkward CSS effects.

### Introduction to the backface-visibility property

This property is associated with 3D transforms, which determine the visibility of the back of a three-dimensional appearance. That is, when a deformation is applied to show the back of an element, it can be hidden or shown with this attribute. Most people would want to hide it because of its awkward flashing effect.

```css
div {
-webkit-backface-visibility: hidden; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
backface-visibility: hidden;
}

```

- Hidden: Hidden behind
- visible : default, showing the other side

You can see the differences in the examples below. If you look closely, you will see unwanted glitters or other side of `visible`.
