Flexbox Overview

Until just a few years ago, `float` and `position` alone allowed some layout to be implemented.
However, as we moved beyond the desktop era and into the mobile era, the need for a more flexible layout mechanism has grown.
The resulting modern layout includes Flexbox, Multi Columns, and Grid.
This chapter covers the Flexbox layout module.

### CSS Flexible Box Layout Module

The Flexible Box module, also known as flexbox, provides space allocation and strong alignment between items within the flexbox interface.

Designed as a one-dimensional layout model for.

What exactly does Flexbox layout mean and what are the advantages?
The most basic model that forms this layout is related to flex containers.
The content of this container is called flex items, and the most basic function of this flex item is its ability to "flex" size.
This means that you can adjust the length of the horizontal or vertical depending on the space, and you can adjust the size based on the ratio to the available space.
Another impressive feature of flex items is that they can set visual order and direction.
Simply put, the flexbox layout module is not restricted to accessibility because it allows flex items to appear in any order or direction we want and operates independently regardless of the actual marked-up sequence.
The flex box module also has the ability to control alignment.
The width and spacing can be equal, the height of the hem can be equal, and the vertical alignment can be easily controlled.

Here is the status of flexbox support:

display:flex - configuring flex formatting environment

When this property is applied to an element, these display values create a new flex formatting context for the content and the content becomes a flex-item.

In other words, if `display:flex;` is set on the parent element, the parent element becomes a flex container and the child element is recognized as a flex item.

Remember, when you configure the flexbox layout module, you must assign this property to the parent element that surrounds the content (flex item).

And when the container element becomes a flex box, all the flex items that are children are arranged based on the default flow and row.

As mentioned earlier, flexbox`s content (flex items) can be located in any direction, can be dynamically changed, or can be automatically sized and positioned within the available space.

flex-direction - orientation, flow, visual ordering

Flex items are placed based on rows and can be changed via the `flex-direction` property.

The attribute `flex-direction` controls the flow direction of an element, that is, whether the flex items should be aligned (arrayed) in the right, left, down, or up directions. The default value of the attribute `flex-direction` is `row`, which allows flex items to be listed based on the Western way of writing (left to right, top to bottom).

The default value is `flex-direction:row;`, so it is placed relative to the row without any additional definition, and the other property values are as follows:

- row : default, list from left to right. (→)
- row-reverse: list from right to left. (←), i.e. reverse.
- column: List items vertically from top to bottom. (↓)
- column-reverse: list items vertically from bottom to top. (↑)

flex-wrap

`flex-wrap` is a property that controls how flex items change heat, that is, whether the flex item is wrapped or wrapped.
When this value is applied, the items are not divided into multiple columns, and the items are all wrapped in one column by adjusting the width.

It can be useful if the width of the parent is smaller than the total width of the flex items (usually overflowed in CSS).

Because the default value is nowrap, the flex container overflows when it is smaller than the nubber sum of the flex items.
This means that as the number of items increases, they are lined up in a single line. (white-space: similar to nowrap)

![image](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flexbox-wrap.png)

The attribute `flex-wrap` values are as follows:

- nowrap : Specifies that flex items are not broken by default.
- Wrap : Allows flex items to heat multiple lines in a container.
- Wrap-reverse: The main spindle is positioned upside down in relation to the cross-axis while maintaining it.
- initial : Sets this property to default value.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

flex-flow - shorthand

This property is a short property that specifies the `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap` values that we learned earlier.

`flex-flow` can specify two factors (parameters) in any order, and it is possible to omit either of them.

Typically, the following order is recommended:

```css
.flex-container {
display: flex;
flex-flow: direction wrap;
}

```

### flex container flow axis (axis)

![image](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/t-80/llflex2-02.png)

To understand the flex box in detail, you need to learn about the axis.

This axis is required to align and has an intersection axis with the main axis.

By default, the direction value of `display:flex` is row (row). Therefore, the main axis is set as the reference point of the row.
In other words, the main axis is the main axis.
On the other hand, cross axis is the axis that crosses the main axis.

The main axis is the main axis start, the center, and the main axis end, which are called `flex-start`, `center`, and `flex-end`.

There are also start, middle, and end points for the cross-axis. The cross axis is also referred to as `flex-start`, `center`, and `flex-end`.

In other words, whether it`s the main axis or the cross axis, there are start, middle, and end points.
However, when flex-direction is changed to column, there is a difference between these axes.

When the column is changed, the cross axis becomes the main axis when the row is turned, and the main axis is changed to the cross axis.
This is why the attribute `flex-direction` is more important.

With the advent of flex, flex-direction and placement (start, center, end) are more flexible than before, and this is called a modern layout.

justify-content - content sorting

As you can see from the meaning of `justify-content`, it is important to align the contents, which is the alignment of the main spindle.

This means that the alignment to the main axis exists separately because it is an alignment to the main axis.

In other words, the value of the default flex-direction works under the assumption of row, which means that the progression of the flex item is listed from left to right (→), and from top to bottom (↓).

Let`s follow up on the alignment of the cross-axis and first look at the `justify-content` attribute values.

- flex-start : By default, sort flex items from the beginning (left) of the flex container.
- flex-end : Aligns flex items from the end of the container (right) to the starting point.
- center : Center the flex items in the center of the container.
- space-between : The first of the flex items aligns to the far left, the last to the far right, and the others arrange the space between them at regular intervals. In other words, the space between a and b is divided into the space between b and c.
- space-around : Applies the same as space-between, but does not align the first and last items with the left and right ends of each, but distributes them evenly around the sorted items.
- space-venly : This property allows you to allocate to a completely even space.
- initial : Follow the default values for this property.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

align-content

If `justify-content` is placed on the main axis, `align-content` is placed on the alignment of the cross axis.

It is the property of arranging flex items in a single batch (group), not individually sorting each of them.

```css
.flex-container {
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
flex-wrap: wrap;
width: 200px;
height: 400px;

/* Alignment to cross-axis */
align-content: flex-start;
/* align-content: flex-start | center | flex-end | space-between | space-around | space-evenly | stretch */
}
.flex-item {
flex: 0 0 50px;
}
```

- Flex-start: The alignment of the cross-axis places flex items in chunks from the top of the container. The free space is shown below these columns.
- center : Center will be centered around the vertical direction for the intersection axis.
- flex-end : aligns with the bottom of the container for the cross-axis. The free space is displayed above these columns.
- space-between, space-around, space-venly : aligns with `justify-content` but with the cross-axis.
- stretch : By default, adjust the height of the items to the same height as the container (unless the flex item height is defined).

### Center Placement Settings

align-items

The property `align-items` can be controlled and placed by associating the alignment of the cross-axis of the flex item with each item.

The property values for `align-items` are as follows:

- stretch : Default; adjusts all flex items to match (equal height value) to each other.
- flex-start : Places the flex items at the beginning (left) of the flex container, but the height of each item depends on the amount of content in each item.
- flex-end : Same rule as flex-start, but places flex items down the container.
- center : Center each item is centered by vertical because it distributes the same space between the top and bottom of each item.
- baseline : Arranges all flex items around the baselines specified in the content. The baseline may vary for each item.

flex item (child) element properties

The flex properties identified above were those used as defined in the flex container.

Let`s learn by reminding that the attributes to be identified are the layout attributes for flex items, which are defined and used in flex items.

### flex-** (single attribute) and flex (shorthand type)

You can specify the width of each flex item and specify the free space allocated between each item, which you will learn about these properties.

```css
.flex-container {
display: flex;
}
.flex-item {
flex-grow: 1;
flex-shrink: 0;
flex-basis: 150px;
/* Shorthand (order important)*/
flex: grow shrink basis;
}
```

flex-basis

In CSS, element widths are defined as `width`, but flex items can be defined as widths using `flex-basis`.

That is, the `flex-basis` property defines the width value and sets the initial size of the flex entry. The remaining space is then distributed based on the glow/shrink factor.
This property also specifies the default value for the flex item and defaults to auto.

flex-basis DEMO VIEW

flex-grow

`flex-grow` is a property that can be defined to increase the width of a flex item.

This property takes a positive, integer value and controls how much of the remaining space should be distributed to the specified flex items.

In other words, `flex-grow: 1;` 1 automatically increases the width of the flex items by distributing them evenly based on the width of the flex container.

`flex-grow: 0;` by default means it does not stretch to the width of the flex container.

flex-grow DEMO VIEW

flex-shrink

`flex-shrink` is a property that can be defined to reduce (reduce) the width of a flex item as opposed to `flex-grow`.

`flex-shrink` behaves similarly to `flex-grow`, which is user-defined, has five flex items, has 100 pixels wide defined in each item, and 600 pixels wide in the flex container.

In this case, the sum of the width of the flex container is larger than the sum of the flex items, so each flex item has a width of 100 pixels.
However, when the flex container becomes smaller than the sum of the flex items, the width designated for each item is ignored and each flex item is reduced based on the width of the flex container.

In other words, if the sum of the width of the flex item is larger than the flex container, if `flex-shrink: 1;` is defined, the flex item will be divided equally based on the width of the flex container.

flex-shrink DEMO VIEW

flex shorthand

The attributes `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` can be specified as shorthand, which are abbreviated attributes.

You can use the flex property to define the expansion, reduction, and initial default width at once, and importantly, keep the order you created earlier.

The default value for flex is `flex: 01 auto;`.

```css
.flex-item {
/* flex-grow is required and the rest is optional */
flex: flex-grow [flex-shrink] [flex-basis];
}
```

The `flex` property, values are as follows:

- flex-grow : Specifies an incremental number for the width that the flex items will occupy. The default is 0.
- flex-shrink : Specifies a decreasing number for the width that the flex items will occupy. The default is 1.
- flex-basis : Specifies the length of the item.
- Auto : 11 is the same as auto.
- Initial : 01 auto is the same.
- None : It`s the same as 00 auto.

### Set Item Order

The flex-flows that allow you to specify these two short attributes in the preceding text allow you to effectively control the order and direction of the flex items.

However, when it comes to visual order, there is a more controlling attribute called `order`.

order

The `order` property works in a similar way to the `z-index` concept because it accommodates integer-based values.

However, it determines where the flex items should appear in the flow of the element, rather than forming a layer.

All flex items are listed (arrayed) in the order in which they are written to the source (markup order) if the flex items share the same `order` value by default.

These tasks have been implemented very hard with `float`, but the numerical values applied to `order` can be very flexible in placing.

![image](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flexbox-order.png)

```css
.flex-container {
height:200px;
flex-flow: row wrap;
}
.flex-item {
display:flex;
flex: 1 0 50px;
justify-content:center;
align-items:center;
}
.flex-item:nth-child(1) { order:2; }
.flex-item:nth-child(2) { order:0; }
.flex-item:nth-child(3) { order:-2; }
.flex-item:nth-child(4) { order:1; }
.flex-item:nth-child(5) { order:3; }
.flex-item:nth-child(6) { order:0; }
.flex-item:nth-child(7) { order:-1; }
```

order DEMO VIEW

align-self

Finally, `align-self` is a property that can be set in flex items.

Looking back on what we learned earlier, we looked at the `align-content` and `align-items` properties as properties that can be set in parents, which are flex containers.

`align-content` was used to control the group of items and `align-items` was used to control individual items.

`align-self` is similar to `align-items` which is set to parents.

If `align-items` is set up to control the children collectively, `align-self` is set up only for the children themselves.

That is, auto is the default as the property that you control when you set it up on your own.

Another important point here is the properties that address alignment to the cross-axis, as do the `align-content` and `align-items` properties.

```css
.flex-container {
height:200px;
flex-flow: row wrap;
}
.flex-item {
display:flex;
flex: 1 0 50px;
justify-content:center;
align-items:center;
}
.flex-item:nth-child(1) {}
.flex-item:nth-child(2) {}
.flex-item:nth-child(3) {
flex:1 0 20px;
height: 100px;
align-self: stretch;
}
.flex-item:nth-child(4) {}
.flex-item:nth-child(5) {}
.flex-item:nth-child(6) {}
.flex-item:nth-child(7) {}
```

The value of the align-self property is as follows:

- stretch : Adjusts all flex items to match (equal height value) by default.
- flex-start : Places the flex items at the beginning (left) of the flex container, but the height of each item depends on the amount of content in each item.
- flex-end : Same rule as flex-start, but places flex items down the container.
- center : Center each item is centered by vertical because it distributes the same space between the top and bottom of each item.
- baseline : Arranges all flex items around the baselines specified in the content. The baseline may vary for each item.

### Finishing the flex modern layout module,

Flexbox is new, exciting, and innovative. Most of all, it`s a module that CSS must have today in order to become a comprehensive tool for responding to movement and implementing web pages.

And it`s time for IT workers to take a step closer to this modern layout module before it`s too late, when multiple browsers, except IE, are now supporting the flexbox and removing the vendor-prefix.

I hope that it will be an opportunity to recognize that it is no longer a next-generation technology to postpone and apply it to your project in various ways.
