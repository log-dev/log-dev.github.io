Elements and attributes associated with forms are the main means of interacting with users. First, learn about the basic structure that makes up the form.

### FORM Element

The form element indicates the range of form (FORM). A form is an area consisting of different types of controls for user input (W3C is called a control for input fields, buttons, etc.), where the starting and ending points of the form are defined by the form elements.

As interactions take place in both directions, there have often been situations in which data has to be collected from users, and control is designed to do so. And it is the form where these controls are gathered.

```html
<form>
...
</form>

```

- Form elements are block-level elements, so you can specify the entire document as a form, or you can specify multiple forms within a document.

The action property specifies the execution application. An execution application is a server or program that processes the entered data. To send data here, the browser must know the location of the transfer (URL), which uses the action property.

```html
<form action="http://www.example.com/addresscheck.html/">
</form>

```

The accept-charset property specifies the accepted character set encoding. Typically, a character set applied to HTML documents is applied. In some cases, however, the characters entered in the form may not be represented as character sets applied throughout the document. In this case, the accept-charset property can be used to apply the appropriate character set.

```html
<form accept-charset="utf-8">
</form>

```

The enctype property specifies the encoding type. This property allows the browser to know what type of encoding it should be when sending input data to the server, which specifies one of three types of encoding:

```html
<form enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
</form>

```

- `entype=`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` : Encoding all characters before sending to the server is specified when the form contains text data (default).
- `entype=`multipart/form-data` : is used to transfer non-character files, such as file upload controls.
- `entype="text/plain" : encoded in plain text.

The method property specifies the HTTP method. The HTTP method refers to a method for sending and receiving data between clients and servers, which is mainly used by GET and POST methods.

```html
<form action="http://www.example.com/form.html/" method="post">
</form>

```

- GET method: The entered data is sent by the URL, so if it is not encrypted, the URL alone can tell what data it entered. It is relatively less secure than the POST method and has limited data that can be transferred.
- POST method: It is a method of processing data on the server side while transferring input data into the HTTP Body. Because HTTP Body can contain more information than URLs, POST methods can transmit more data than GET methods, and are relatively secure.

The name property specifies the form name. This property is required when referencing forms in a script.

```html
<form action="http://www.example.com/form.html/" method="post" name="profile_new">
</form>

```

The novalidate property is a newly added property in HTML5, which specifies non-validation. When this property is specified, the data entered in the form is not checked when it is sent to the server.

```html
<form action="http://www.example.com/form.html/" method="post" name="profile_new" novalidate="novalidate">
</form>

```

### FIELDSET Elements

The fieldset element displays a set of related form fields (form FIELD SET). A set of form fields refers to a group of related controls within a form.

```html
<form>
<fieldset>
...
</fieldset>
</form>

```

- Form can be effectively stratified.
- The legend element shall be used together.

The form property specifies the form to which the fieldset element belongs. Specifying this property allows the relationship between a particular form and a fieldset element to be explicitly linked. This connection makes it easier for the browser to interact with the two elements and allows the two to maintain a relationship even if the fieldset element is outside the form element. In particular, it is an effective property when one fieldset element must relate to multiple form elements.

```html
<form id="user">
...
</form>
<p>The fieldset below is outside the form element, but still part of the form</p>
<fieldset form="user">
<legend>Registration</legend>
...
</fieldset>

```

### LEGEND Element

The legend element displays the title (LEGEND) of the fieldset element. When multiple controls are tied using the fieldset element, it is necessary to tell what nature or purpose this batch is, and use the legend element.

```html
<form>
<fieldset>
<legend>Privacy:</legend>
<label>이름: <input type="text"></label><br>
<label>주소: <input type="text"></label><br>
<input type="submit">
</fieldset>
</form>

```

- With this element, a border line appears around the area bound by the fieldset element.
- This element must be used in conjunction with the parent element, the fieldset element, so the first child element of the fieldset element must be the legend element.

Please refer to the foam elements below.
