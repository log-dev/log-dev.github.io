Recently, a lot of `box-sizing: border-box` is used to facilitate the calculation of box models, which only works with IE8 and later. Learn how to support this in older browsers.

### Box Sizing Polyfill 소개

IE7 This is a polyfill required to implement box-sizing of CSS in lower versions.

### How to Use Box Sizing Polyfill

Upload the boxsizing.htc file to the server and add code to apply only to IE7 and earlier versions.

```html
<!--[if lte IE7]>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/ie.css">
<![endif]-->

```

Create an i.css file.

```css
* {
behavior: url(경로/boxsizing.htc);
}

```

You should be careful about the path, but you should write the relative path of the HTML file.

When writing box-sizing, we also apply *:before, *:after to PSudo-element, but we do not support IE7 or below, so we do not need it.

The server must have a setting for content-type for the .htc file.

```undefined
AddType text/x-component .htc

```
