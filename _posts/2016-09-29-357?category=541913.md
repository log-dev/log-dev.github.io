Rem

You`ve probably considered using a more flexible measurement unit.

But if you haven`t fully understood when you`re going to use the rem unit and when you`re going to use the em, please understand through this article.

### Rem Vs Em

Both em and rem are variable units that are flexible in length, converted to pixel values by the browser according to the font size set in the design.

If you specify a value of 1em or 1rem, it can be converted to 16px to 160px by the browser, or to a variety of other values.

Converted to 160px

On the other hand, the value of px is recognized by the browser as an absolute value, so literally 1px is always exactly 1px.

Adjust (drag) the slider shown in CodePen below to see how the rem and em values are converted to different pixel values.

On the other hand, you can also see that the size is fixed when it is clearly designated in px units.

See the Pen

a big question

Em and rem units make the design flexible, allowing you to increase and decrease the size of the components rather than just staying in a fixed size.

This flexibility makes it much easier to cope with the different development situations encountered during the development period, and allows browser users to manually configure the best environment for reading as they resize the entire site.

Important differences

Both em and rem have similar properties, bringing this flexibility, and the biggest question here is, when should we use the em value and when should we use the rem value?

The difference between em and rem is the determinant that the browser considers when converting it to a px value.

These differences are important clues to where each unit should be used.

First, you need to have a clear understanding of how the units of rem and em are actually applied.

Then let`s look at where we need to use the em or rem units.

Finally, you will learn the practical application of each commonly used unit during design operations.

### How is the rem unit converted to a pixel value

When you write rem units, the converted pixel size is based on the font size of the page top element, or html element.

The font size of this top-level element multiplied by the number specified in rem is the last converted value.

For example, if the font size of the top-level element is 16px, 10rem is 160px. In other words, 10 x 16 = 160.

Converted to 160px

### Formula in which em units are converted to pixel values

When you write em units, the pixel value that is converted is multiplied by the font size of the element you specify.

For example, if a font size of either div is 18px, 10em equals 180px.

That is, the calculation is 10 x 18 = 180.

Converted to 180px (or set to approximate)

Important Things to Know

It is often misunderstood that the em units are directly related to the font size of the parent element.

In fact, according to the W3 specification, it is directly related to the font size of the elements actually used.

The font size of the parent element may affect the em value, but if so, it is only because of style inheritance.

Let`s look at why and how this actually works.

### Effect of style inheritance on em units

When working with em units, you may encounter some complicated situations related to inheritance.

This is because all elements automatically inherit font sizes from their parent.

So the only way to reverse the effect of this inheritance is to specify the font size by using units that are not affected by inheritance, such as px or vw.

The font size of the element in which the em unit is used determines its converted value.

However, the element may have inherited the font size from the element directly above it, and so may the element above it, the font size may have inherited the font size from the element.

As such, the em value is influenced by the font size of all parent elements.

Let`s take a look at the example.

Follow the steps below and follow them directly from CodePen.

By following this, you can see the actual pixel value of the em unit converted with Chrome Developer Tools or Firefox for Firebug.

Example of em inheritance

Assuming that the font size at the first end of the page is specified as 16px (usually the default), and 1.5em as padding is specified for the embedded div, the div inherits a font size of 16px from the top element.

So the padding value is converted to 24px.

Calculation: 1.5 x 16 = 24

See the Pen

So, what if we create another div that surrounds the first div and designate its font-size as 1.25em?

See the Pen

The enclosing div inherits the font size of the top-level element, 16px, and multiplies it by 1.25em, the font-size set for itself.

So the font size of the div will be 20px.

Calculation: 1.25 x 16 = 20

The original div is now not affected by direct inheritance from the top-level element, but instead inherits a font size of 20px from the wrapped new parent element.

The padding value for div set to 1.5em is now 30px.

Calculation: 1.5 x 20 = 30

If you specify an em-based font size for the original div, this rate of increase will be greater, and below is an example of specifying 1.2em.

See the Pen

The innermost div inherits a font size of 20px from its parent, and then multiplies its 1.2em setting to display a new font size of 24px.

The padding value of the div set to 1.2 x 20 = 24.1.5em changes to 36px this time to match the new font size.

Calculation: 1.5 x 24 = 36

Finally, to take a closer look at how the em unit is proportional to the font size of the element actually used (regardless of its parent), we will look at how the 1.5em padding value changes if you specify a font size 14px that is not affected by inheritance in the div.

See the Pen

The padding value is now reduced to 21px.

Calculation: 1.5 x 14 = 21. You can see that the font size of the parent element is not affected at all.

Because of these complex characteristics, you can see why you need to understand to effectively manage em units.

### How browser settings affect font size for HTML elements

By default, the font size of the browser is usually set to 16px, but it can be changed from 9px to 72px by the user.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/211A2B4A573D465C2C)

Important Things to Know

The font size of the html element at the top, unless it is explicitly overwritten by specifying a fixed value, will inherit the value set in the browser.

Thus, the font size specified in the html element determines the rem value directly, but the font size may have been passed from the browser settings in the first place.

Therefore, the font size setting specified in the browser affects the value in all rem units used in the design, and so do all em units affected by inheritance.

If the font size of HTML is not specified, the browser settings will be effective.

Unless overwritten, the html element inherits the default font size set in the browser.

For example, suppose the html element at a particular site does not have a font-size value set.

If the user has set the default font size of the browser to 16px, the font size of the top-level element will be 16px.

In Chrome Developer Tools, you can view the values inherited by the element in the Show inherited properties item on the Computed tab.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2458374B573D470219)

In the view above, 10rem will have a 160px value.

Calculation: 10 x 16 = 160

If the user grew the font size of the browser to 18px, the font size of the top element would be 18px.

The 10rem is now converted to 180px.

Calculation: 10 x 18 = 180

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/26504E4C573D474117)

### Effect of browser settings on HTML font size set in em

If you specified an em-based font size for the html element, the converted pixel value is a multiple of the font size specified in the browser.

For example, if the html element on the site is specified as a font-size value of 1.25em, the font size of the top-level element is 1.25 times the font size set in the browser.

If the font size of the browser is set to 16px, the font size of the top element will be 20px.

Calculation: 1.25 x 16 = 20

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/276A6547573D47B236)

In this case, 10rem equals 200px.

10 x 20 = 200

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2570174D573D482538)

However, if the font size of the browser is set to 20px, the font size of the top element is converted to 25px instead.

1.25 x 20 = 25

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/241B7C47573D486A0C)

And 10rem will be the same as 250px.

10 x 25 = 250

Summary of em and rem differences

The following summary can be summarized as follows:

### Why rem??

The greatest advantage of the rem unit is not just returning a consistent size regardless of the inheritance characteristics of the element.

Rather, the main reason is that by using the rem unit instead of where the px unit was written in the past, all components placed on the site according to the font size you set up provide a way to respond appropriately.

For this reason, the main purpose of using rem units is to ensure that the site layout is properly adjusted to the variable text size, no matter what value the user sets the default font size of the browser to.

At first, we proceed with the design according to the default font size of the browser, 16px.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2678B84E573D4A2E18)

But if you use the lim unit, even if you increase the font size, the layout will remain intact, and the text will not be crushed in a very tight space that only fits the small text.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/211A7750573D4ADA14)

Browser Font Size 34px

Also, even if the user reduces the font size, the entire layout will also decrease, and there will be no mishaps where the text that looks very small will appear to be filled in the wasted white margin.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/217F2A4E573D4B5A1A)

Browser Font Size 9px

There are many reasons why users change the font size setting, but it can be adjusted to the optimal use environment due to poor eyesight or various sizes of equipment used and the appropriate usage distance.

If you respond appropriately to these user settings, you can provide a much better user experience.

Important Things to Know

Occasionally, a designer may have implemented a rem-based layout, specifying a fixed px unit with the font-size of the html element.

The reason for this would be to change the font size of the html element and grow the overall design or make it smaller.

However, if you do this, the html element will ignore the font size that the user has set in the browser, so this is a way to avoid it.

If you ignore the user`s settings, you lose the ability to have an optimized content interpretation environment from the user.

If you still want to change the font size of the html element, you should instead specify the font size as em or rem so that it can be maintained at a constant rate of the browser font size you specify.

This allows you to enlarge or shrink the design as you change the font size of the html element, and at the same time, the effect of your browser settings can still be maintained.

### Why Rem??

The biggest advantage of the em unit is that it has characteristics that vary depending on the font size of other elements besides the html element.

For this reason, the main purpose of using em units is to use them when the special circumstances of the design elements require the corresponding variability.

For example, it is recommended to use the em values when setting padding, margin, and line-height around each item that belongs to the Move Site menu.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/26314B49573D4D842E)

Menu with 0.9em font size

Thus, if the font size of the menu changes, it does not affect other surrounding layouts, and the space around the menu item changes proportionally.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2711054E573D4DD31C)

Menu with 1.2em font size

As we`ve seen in inheritance earlier, it`s very difficult to constantly manage the fluctuations in em units.

For this reason, it is recommended that you use the em unit only when necessary.

### Practical Use

It can be a bit of a debate among web designers, and the recommendations can be different, but the following are my recommendations.

When to use em units

Use where the size should change based on the font-size of a particular element other than the top-level element.

Typically, the only example of how to write em units is when an element is sized is not specified as the default font size.

As you`ve seen in the previous example, the menu items, buttons, and titles of the design components will have their own font sizes specified.

If we change the font size of these, we will hope that the size of all components will be changed proportionally.

The setup properties corresponding to these instructions include margin, padding, width, height, and line-height, of course, the element used must not be specified as the default font size.

One more thing to tell you is that when you use em units, make sure to use rem units for font size of specified elements so that you can avoid ambiguous situations due to inheritance and change size symmetrically.

If possible, please do not use em units in font size.

Usually, the font size, especially the title, is used a lot of em units, but it will be easier to manage the design if you just use the rem units.

Often the title uses em units instead of px units because of their properties proportional to the normal character size.

But the lim units have the same properties.

If you change the font size of the html element, it will be changed according to the title size.

Test by changing the em font size of html elements directly in the following CodePen.

See the Pen

Except for a few exceptions, few would want the font size to change under the influence of other elements other than those specified in the top-level element.

An example of an em-based font size is a drop-down menu, but usually the font size of the menu item in the second step is based on the font size of the menu in the first step.

Another example is that when you size the font icon used for a button, you need to match the size of the button text that you have together.

However, most elements of web design do not require this requirement, so typically, when specifying font sizes, you will only need to use the em units in special circumstances.

### If you need to write a unit of rem

Use where the size of the font set up in the browser must change, except for the reason why the em units described above should be used.

These include height, width, padding, margin, border width, most font sizes, shadows, and so on, basically every part of the layout.

In other words, we recommend using lim units where the size should change.

the trick

When configuring the layout, it is easier to think in pixels and convert the results to rem later.

If you use a preprocessor such as Stylus/Sass/Less, or a postprocessor such as PXtoRem plug-in in PostCss, you can automatically calculate the conversion of pixels to rem.

If not, you can use PXtoEM by yourself to convert it.

Always recommend using rem Media Queries.

When configuring a design that needs to change in size at a constant rate by using the units of rem, it is important to write the units of rem when using media queries.

This will automatically adjust the media queries you create to the appropriate layout, responding correctly to the font size of your browser.

For example, if a user grows letters very large, the layout will have to be reduced from two column shapes to one column, even for small screen-sized handheld devices.

If the layout switching point has a fixed pixel width, only the screen size has its effect.

However, if it is a turning point based on rem, it will respond to different font sizes.

### When both em and rem should not be used

Width of multi-column layout

Multiple columns in a layout should usually have a %-based unit to respond fluidly to unexpected screen sizes.

If there is only one column, it will normally work smoothly even if you specify a rem value for max-width.

For example:

```css
.container {
width: 100%;
max-width: 75rem;
}
```

This will change the size of the column to be fluid, but at the same time, it can prevent the writing in it from becoming too wide to be uncomfortable to read.

When the size of an element must never change,

In a typical web design, changing size of layout components does not often lead to inappropriate situations.

However, sometimes you may have to specify a fixed value to prevent the size from changing.

If you need to consider something before specifying a fixed size value, the layout will be broken if the size of that element changes.

However, there are not many cases like this, so please review again to see if it is really necessary before taking out the px units.

### at the end

Let`s summarize what we`ve explained so far.

- The units of rem and em used in the design are converted to pixel values by the browser based on font size.
- The em units are based on the font size of the specified element. The unit of rem is based on the font size of the html element.
- The em unit can be affected by inheriting font sizes from all parent parent elements.
- The rem unit has the attribute of inheriting the font size set in the browser. Use em units where the font size of other elements should change, rather than the font size specified in the top-level element.
- I recommend that you use the rem unit where you don`t need to write the em unit and the size should change depending on the font size setting of the browser.
- If you don`t have to use em units, including font size designation, please use rem units.
- Please also use the rem units for media queries.
- Do not use em or rem for the width of the multi-column layout, but use % instead. If the size changes, do not use both em and rem if the layout of the element cannot be prevented from being broken.
