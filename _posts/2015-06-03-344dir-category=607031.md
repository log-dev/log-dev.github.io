### float

Specify how and in which direction the box flows. This property does not apply to elements with locations.

```css
.left {float: left;}
.right {float: right}

```

- Left: Float the element to the left.
- Right: Float the element to the right.
- None: Do not float the element. This is the default.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.cssFloat="left"

```

The inherit value is not supported below IE7. IE8 requires !DOCTYPE. IE9 to support normally.

> When configuring the layout with float, it often encounters unexpected problems, so please refer to solving the float layout problem.

### clear

Specifies aspects of an element that cannot be adjacent to another element. The float property returns the changed flow to its original state. Once the flow changes, all subsequent elements are affected by the flow, so the clear property should be used in the appropriate location.

```css
img {float: left;}
p.clear {clear: both;}

```

- left : Remove the flow of the left side.
- right : Remove the flow on the right side.
- Both: Remove the flow from side to side.
- none : default allows left and right flows.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.clear="left"

```
