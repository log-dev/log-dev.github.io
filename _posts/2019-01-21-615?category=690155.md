Understand about CSS box model and how to set size of box using properties that make up box such as `margin`, `border`, and `padding` and numerical properties such as `width` and `height`.

To manipulate the layout (placement) of HTML elements using CSS, you must have an understanding of the box model.

# CSS Box Model

## Understanding block vs inline vs inline-block properties between elements

To understand the box model, you need to know about the `block` element, the `inline` element, and the `inline block` element.

block level 요소 (Flow Contents)

Block boxes can be included or included in other block boxes, and can be set width / height.

If you do not include content inside, the height is 0.

By default, the width value is applied as auto, increasing by the width of the parent region that contains you.
Therefore, the next sibling element created later in the markup is located below that element.
Simply put, it usually means a line-breaking element.

section, article, aside, header, footer, nav, main, hx, div, o, dl, dt, dd, ul, ol, p, audio, video, blockquote, canvas, fieldset, figure, figcaption, footer, form, table, tfoot, hr, nos

inline 요소 (Phrasing Contents)

Inline boxes can be included or included in other in-line boxes, but cannot contain block elements.

Width / height is not possible, and it will have as much height and width as the content contained inside.

In other words, you can only have as much width as the content you contain (such as text).
The user`s random assignment of the width property is not reflected.
Therefore, on the markup, the next sibling element sticks next to the right on the basic flow.

inline-block element

Inline block boxes are basically rendered on the screen like inline with inline properties, but they can be set width/height like block boxes (such as ``<img>, ``input>, `` and ``button``).

By default, it only has as much width as it contains, but users can set the width by randomly assigning the width attribute (like an inline element). This is the difference from the inline element.
For example, in situations where layouts need to be placed side by side, think of situations where you need to apply the width attribute to each element.
A simple example is horizontal navigation. Of course, listing only a element is horizontal, but the width property does not apply.
This is because the `a` element is basically inline.
However, if you set `a` element to inline-block, unlike the block setting, you can set items by giving the width property while maintaining the horizontal layout.

## margin-box, border-box, padding-box, content-box

The box consists of an external space box (margin-box), a border-box, an internal space box, and a content-box.

The inline box can set margin and padding space in the left/right direction, but not in the up/down direction.

margin, padding

`Padding` is the property of specifying the outer margin of an element by `margin`.

The property `margin` is as follows:

- margin : abbreviated properties of margin properties
- margin-top : specify top spacing outside element
- margin-right : Specifies the right-hand interval outside the element
- margin-bottom:Specify lower spacing outside element
- margin-left : Specifies the left gap outside the element

```css
margin: 10px 5px 15px 20px; (top right bottom left)
margin: 10px 5px 15px; (top right-left bottom)
margin: 10px 5px; (top-bottom right-left)
margin: 10px; (top-right-bottom-left)
```

The `padding` property is as follows:

- padding : abbreviated properties of padding properties
- padding-top : specifying top spacing inside element
- padding-right : specifying the right-hand gap inside an element
- padding-bottom:Specify the bottom spacing inside an element
- padding-left : specifying the left-hand gap inside the element

```css
padding: 10px 5px 15px 20px; (top right bottom left)
padding: 10px 5px 15px; (top right-left bottom)
padding: 10px 5px; (top-bottom right-left)
padding: 10px; (top-right-bottom-left)
```

border

The property used to apply a line (boundary) to the `border` element.

The border property is an abbreviated property that gives a border effect to an element and can declare all border properties at once.

The properties of border-color, border-width, and border-style can be declared all at once, and only style-color or style-width, such as {border:solid #ff0000;}, is acceptable.

Instead, you must declare the style property no matter what value you give.

Border properties, values are as follows:

- border : specify width (bold) of border
- border-(top|right|bottom|left)-width : specify width of border (bold)
- border-(top|right|bottom|left)-style : Specifies the style of the border
`dotted` : Dot (dotted line) border designation, `dashed` : dash symbol (-) border designation, `solid` : general line border designation, `double` : border designation with two lines
- border-(top|right|bottom|left)-color : specify border color

```css
.selector {
border-(top|right|bottom|left)-width
border-(top|right|bottom|left)-style
border-(top|right|bottom|left)-color
border: width style color
border-top: width style color
border-right: width style color
border-bottom: width style color
border-left: width style color
}
```

outline

`outline` is a line surrounding the outside of an element, and if `border` is applied to an element, `outline` is created outside of that.

outline properties, values are as follows:

- outline : abbreviated (shorthand) properties of outline properties
- outline-color : Specifies the color of the line outside the element
- outline-style : Specifies the style of the line outside the element
- outline-width : specifies the width of the line outside the element

The outline can only be style-color or style-width, such as `{outline:solid #FF0000}`, but you must declare the style property that you gave any value instead.

Because `outline` is not a part of an element`s domain, giving `outline` to any element has no effect on `width` and `height`.
That is, the outline does not include the thickness of the outline in the width and height boxes.

## CSS Dimension

Dimension is the dimension of the height and width of the space, etc.

In CSS, you can define width and height with the following properties:

- width -- box (element) width
- height -- Box height
- min-width -- Minimum width that the box (element) can have
- min-height -- Minimum height that the box (element) can have
- max-width -- Minimum maximum width a box (element) can have
- max-height -- Minimum maximum height that the box (element) can have

```css
.selector {
width: value;
max-width: value;
min-width: value;
height: value;
max-height: value;
min-height: value;
}
```

### Box Sizing

Defining the exact width and height values for an element is very important when aligning the layout.

If the element is applied with inner margins and lines and the element width and height values are incorrectly calculated, the layout may not be aligned as intended.

## overflow

The property of controlling (controling) the overflow of boxes (element) determines how to render the parent box to the screen when the child box crosses the parent box.

In other words, it specifies how the content in the box (element) is expressed, such as whether to scroll through it or not to show the overflow.

overflow properties, values are as follows:

- auto : Specifies that the region of the parent box automatically generates scrolling if any part of the child box is out of the child box
- visible : default, specifying that all deviations from the area are visible without being short
- hidden : hide out of the area and make it invisible
- scroll : hide any deviations from the area but create scrolls for viewing
