Prototype-based programming

One of the most important reasons to call JavaScript an object-oriented language is that it enables the extension and reuse of prototypal inheritance.

Prototype-based programming is a programming technique for creating new objects using prototypes that are prototypes of objects. These newly created objects also have their own prototypes, and using the prototype of this new object, we can create another new object, and we call this method of extending the object into the structure a prototype-based programming language.

Because the term prototype used in JavaScript is largely divided into two, it is important to distinguish between the two.

It is divided into the prototype object that the prototype property points to and the prototype link that represents the prototype of the object that created itself.

ECMAScript also calls these prototype links an implicit prototype link.

### Prototype of JavaScript

Every object in JavaScript has a hidden connection to the circular object that created itself. The prototype of the object used to create itself is called a prototype.

The end of this link is the prototype object of the object because all objects in JavaScript are scaled based on the prototype of the object.

The dictionary meaning of prototypes is original and circular, and the meaning of prototypes in programming languages is not much different.

In other words, the person who becomes the parent of an object to be created is called a prototype.

In languages such as Java and C++, Class can be interpreted as a prototype of JavaScript.
