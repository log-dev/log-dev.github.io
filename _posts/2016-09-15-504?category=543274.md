HTML Elements Used Mostly in Practice

HTML Elements is created within the `body` tag, and the tags used in the body area correspond to the structure that represents the web service.

### Headings – h1~h6

The heading tag is used for the main title of the document, and the higher the importance of the title, the lower the `hx` value.

In other words, the title, the title, the title, the title, the title, the title, the title of the title. You can configure to .

```undefined
"<h1>Privacy policy guidance</h1>
<h2>The items and methods of collecting personal information</h2>
<h3> collects personal information </h3>
```

### Paragraphs – p

Use to express a paragraph in a sentence, and if you need to use a new sentence, try to declare a new p-tag.

It is usually used with heading tags.

```undefined
<p>This site was created for personal purposes.</p>
Visitors to <p>Please leave a guest book.</p>
```

### Lists – dl(definition list), ul(unordered list), ol(ordered list)

Use to create definitive lists, ordered lists, and numbered lists (lists).

The definitive description has the tags `dt` (definition-list term) and `dd` (definition-list description) as its children.

And `ul` and `ol` have `li` (listed item) as their children.

```undefined
<dl>
<dt>Noun</dt>
<dd>Words that represent the name of a thing</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Commercial medicine list</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cold medicine</li>
<li>Disinfectant</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ranking of real-time spikes</h3>
<ol>
<li>IU</li>
<li>Afterschool</li>
</ol>
```

### Links – a, image map

Use to express link elements. anchor hypertext reference="url"

```undefined
<a href="#" target="_blank">페이스북</a>

<img src="planets.gif" width="145" height="126" alt="Planets" usemap="#planetmap">
<map name="planetmap">
<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,82,126" alt="Sun" href="sun.htm">
<area shape="circle" coords="90,58,3" alt="Mercury" href="mercur.htm">
<area shape="circle" coords="124,58,8" alt="Venus" href="venus.htm">
</map>
```

### Images - img

Use to represent foreground images and src(source) is to define where the resource is, meaningfully.

And alt (alternate text) is the creation of an alternative text to replace (express) the image.

This is essential for web accessibility, and if it is a meaningless image, it can be left blank, that is, blank.

However, the `alt` property cannot be omitted.

```undefined
<img src="smiley.gif" width="42" height="42" alt="Smiley face"> 
```

### Tables – table, tr, th, td, caption, col 등..

Use to represent table data.

```undefined
<table summary="">
<caption></caption>
<col width="20"><col>
<thead>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tfoot>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tfoot>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
```

- tr(table row)
- th(table heading): Cells with header information
- td (table data) : cells with data information
- The title of the table must be provided as `caption`.
`captions` are declared immediately after `table` elements.
If the title of the table should not be expressed in UI, it can be hidden by applying blind style.
- `summary` is intended to summarize the structure and contents of tables in an environment where it is difficult to see them at a glance.
The title of the table must be provided as `caption`, and `summary` optionally provided as needed.
If the title of the table is not represented in the UI, it can be hidden by applying a blind style

### div, span, em, strong

The `division` element is used to divide the blocked area.

The `span` element is a word for a short area and is mainly used to express designs between inline elements.

It also defines the forms that are in the body within the p, div tags.

The `strong` element is used to express letters with strong emphasis.

`em` (emphasized text) indicates a weak emphasis, i.e. weaker emphasis than strong.

```undefined
'<div>Left paragraph</div>
<div>Right paragraph</div>

<span class="ico_help">도움말</span>

<strong>strong emphasis</strong>

£££ £££ £££ £££ £££ ££££
```

### Forms – input, select, textarea, button

Form elements are used to express user input forms.

Form elements are responsible for enabling Web documents to interact with each other, and the `form` tag displays the range of forms.

A form is an area consisting of different types of controls for user input (W3C is called a control for input fields, buttons, etc.), where the starting and ending points of the form are defined by the form elements.

A form element is a block-level element that can also specify a whole document as a form or multiple forms within a document.

In other words, you can understand that this is a bowl for sending information that you have entered.

```undefined
<input type="text">

<select>
<option>Seoul</option>
<option>Incheon</option>
</select>

<textarea cols="5" rows="15"> </textarea>

<button type="button">도움말</button> 
```

```undefined
<form method="get" action="http://www.example.com/addresscheck.html/">
<fieldset>

</fieldset>
</form>
```

- For `form` tags, form tags, etc. that are part of `fieldset` elements are designated.
- Specifying this property allows the relationship between a particular form and a fieldset element to be explicitly linked.
- This connection makes it easier for the browser to interact with the two elements.
- The fieldset element displays a set of related form fields (form FIELD SET).
- A set of form fields refers to a group of related controls within a form.
- Form can be effectively stratified.
- The legend element shall be used together.

The `action` property specifies the execution application.

The execution application requires the browser to know the location of the transfer (URL) to send the data to the server or program that processes the entered data, and uses the `action` attribute to do so.

At the front end, even if you do not know the property value for `action`, you should leave the property value blank and define it.

`method` defines a data transfer method, usually defined by developers, so it is common to write it down as an empty value.

```undefined
'<legend>Recommended (Accessibility) </legend> to use the legend of the form group (the title of the form)'
```

- `legend` element indicates the title (LEGEND) of `fieldset` element.
- Tell `fieldset` what kind of content it is and create it just once after the fieldset element.
- Make sure to use fields and legends in html, and use xthml optionally, but do not omit it if accessibility is considered.

INPUT Element

The `input` element displays the input area (INPUT field) on a web page.

That is, the input area is where the control for data entry or editing is located, and the type of input control is specified by the type attribute.

Thus, the attribute value that specifies the type of input element represents the type of input controller, which creates the shape of the specified input control.

Some attribute values also affect mobile, so they print out convenient keyboard keyboards.

```undefined
<input type="text" name="" id="">
```

- `type="text" : The attribute text is the default value of the input element, and a text field is created to allow text to be entered.
- The vertical size of the text field is fixed and only the horizontal size can be set.
- The size is determined by the number of characters and the default size is 20.

```undefined
<input type="submit" value="">
```

- `type="submit": The property value submit is made with a transfer button.
- The transfer button only serves to send the form to the server, but how and where it is sent is determined by the form element.
- The button name is specified by the value property, which, if not specified, displays the name that the browser specifies.

```undefined
<input type="reset" value="">
```

- `type="reset": Reset property value is made with an initialization button. Initialization returns the value entered in the form to the initial value.

```undefined
<input type="button" value="">
```

- type="button" : property value button is created.
- There are no basic functions for various purposes, and client-side scripts such as JavaScript are required to execute the function.
- The text entered as a value property is the button name, which appears above the actual button.

```undefined
<input type="button" value="">
```

- `type="button" : The property value button is created.
- There are no basic functions for various purposes, and client-side scripts such as JavaScript are required to execute the function.
- The text entered as a value property is the button name, which appears above the actual button.

```undefined
<input type="password" name="" id="">
```

- `type="password" : A password field is created when the attribute value password is specified.
- It is indicated by a star or circle symbol so that it is not read on the screen.

```undefined
<input type="file" name="" id="">
```

- `type="file" : File upload control is created when the attribute value is specified as file.
- The File Upload Control is a control for selecting files on a local computer and consists of a text field where the file name is entered and a button for calling the File Explorer.
- The accept property allows the browser to configure a file upload control so that only specified file types can be found.

```undefined
<input type="checkbox" name="nation" value="korea" checked="checked">한국
<input type="checkbox" name="nation" value="japan">일본
```

- `type="checkbox" : A checkbox is created when a property value is specified as checkbox.
- The check box is an input control to determine whether it is selected or not, and the input state is divided into selected and unselected.
- The check box is a control for multi-selection and can be configured as multiple check boxes.
- At this time, the name property is required to inform the browser that it is a check box related to each other.
- The checkd property makes it selected.

```undefined
<input type="radio" name="rdo" id=""> 고양이
<input type="radio" name="rdo" id=""> 강아지지
```

- `type="radio" : Radio button is created when the attribute value is specified as radio (radio button originating from the car).
- A radio button, like a check box, is a control to check whether it is selected or not. However, only a single choice is made that does not support duplicate selection.
- This means that they are used to select one of several items, which must be mutually exclusive.

Label Element

- `label` element indicates control label (LABEL).
- A label is a title or name used to identify an item or file.
- Since its use is only visually represented, `label` elements should be used so that browsers can know the relationship between labels and controls.

```undefined
"<!-- explicit label -->
<label for="userName">이름 : </label>
<input type="text" name="" id="userName" value="김재희">

[!-- Implicit label -->
< implicit label <input type="text" name=""></label>
```

for properties

The for attribute specifies the control associated with the label.

And methods that provide labels to controls are largely divided into implicit and explicit methods.

Implicit Label Declaration Method

- This method places controls within the label element.
- In other words, the control within the label element is considered relevant without having to disclose it.

Explicit Label Declaration Method

- This method uses the attribute for to accurately specify the id value of the control.
- That is, to clarify the fact that labels relate to certain controls.
- Clarifying means that mechanical connections are possible.
- This allows the browser to handle the associated controls being selected even if the user clicks on the label, and allows the relationship between the label and the control to be easily connected, even if they are separated from each other.

```undefined
<label for="member">
<span>members</span>
<input type="text" name="" id="member">
</label>
```

This approach to label processing has the advantage of having the text as a member act as a label text, grouping it into `span` elements, applying styles independently of this element, and improving accessibility to screen readers.

select

```undefined
<select name="" id="">
<option value="">html</option>
<option value="">css</option>
<option value="">javascript</option>
</select>
```

- It is called Select Box, Combo Box, and it is used to select from several items.
- `select` and `option` elements are used together.
- The `select` element displays the selection control and the option element displays the option item.
- It is usually used when there are many restrictions on space and is designed by the planning team.
Or you can express it with a radio button.
- Selection controls are controls for selecting OPTION elements and are designed to make option lists available like menus, similar to drop-down lists.

option

- The option element displays the OPTION list.
- The option list is a collection of items that users can choose from.
- It cannot contain any other elements and may only contain text.

selected="selected"

- The selected property specifies the preselected option.
- The list of options is listed on a certain basis and provided with the first option selected by default.
- If you want to change these default choices, you can specify the selected property.

value

- The `value` property specifies the value sent to the server.
- If this property is not specified, the marked-up text in the option element is sent to the server.

size property

- The `size` property specifies the size of the selection control.
- This size refers to the size of the display area where the option is exposed.

```undefined
<select>
<optgroup label="Swedish Cars">
<option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
<option value="saab">Saab</option>
</optgroup>
<optgroup label="German Cars">
<option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
<option value="audi">Audi</option>
</optgroup>
</select>
```

optgroup element

- `optgroup` element indicates Option GROUP.
- An option group is a group created by a group of one or more options.
- If the number of options is high, grouping similar options improves convenience.
- `optgroup` element consists of parent element and option element is composed of child element.
- Specifying `label` properties results in a label for an option group.

```undefined
<textarea name="" id="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
```

- The `cols` property specifies the number of characters that can be entered in the vertical row, and specifies the width of the text area in the number of characters, which defaults to 20.
- If the text area is over 20 characters, the width of the text area that was originally stored remains the same as the scrollbar was created.
- The maxlength property specifies the maximum number of characters a user can enter.
- If this property is specified, no more characters are entered when the maximum number of characters is exceeded.
- Since users do not know whether or not to limit the number of characters, it is recommended that they provide a phrase that tells the maximum number of characters around the text area.

```undefined
<iframe src="http://www.daum.net" width="500" height="400"></iframe>

```

- An eye frame can be seen as a page in a page.
- It is often used to insert other content within a page.
- Eyeframes are not recommended, but there are also projects that are frequently used by developers and development environments.
- The design cannot be customized because it is a different service page (for security reasons).
- It is possible within the same domain.

address

```undefined
