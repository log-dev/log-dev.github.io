Design Pattern

JavaScript does not provide the ability to create and manage libraries on a linguistic level.

However, design patterns can be used to create independent, reusable JavaScript libraries.

The issue of how or style code is written is a problem that can occur in any language, regardless of the particular language.

As for design patterns, design patterns refer to code patterns, such as solutions presented by several people to solve specific issues that arise during the programming process.

Module

Programs evolve from small and simple to large and complex.

In the process, various techniques are used to increase the recyclability of the code and to facilitate maintenance.

One of them is to separate the code into several files. The effect that can be achieved through this is as follows.

> Frequently used code can be made into separate files and recycled whenever needed (similar to the reuse of functions).
Improving code improves the behavior of all applications using it.
You can quickly find the logic needed for code modification. (Split the module into a file and you'll find it quickly)
By loading only the required logic (files), memory waste can be reduced.
Because once downloaded modules are stored by a web browser, they can save time and network traffic when loading the same logic. (Browser only)
