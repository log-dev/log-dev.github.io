There are several server monitoring tools available in Ubuntu. Among them, let`s take advantage of server monitoring using the module provided by Apache.

### mod_staus

This module monitors server health in Apache. In Ubuntu 12.04, status.conf and status.load are installed in /etc/apache2/mods-available.

It will be activated by default.

```bash
sudo a2enmod status

```

Set the IP to be connected by adding `All from IP address to be allowed` as shown below.

```undefined
sudo vi /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/status.conf

<Location /server-status>
SetHandler server-status
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Allow from 127.0.0.1 ::1
# The same network bandwidth was established with IP addresses to allow access.
Allow from 192.168.0.0/24
</Location>

```

Devices with IP set to Allow from: access to http://serverIP/server-stauts via a web browser.

If x-winidow is installed, run a web browser on the server to access http://localhost/server-staus

Sometimes it is necessary to access through an external network, but in case the IP of the access location is inconsistent, the server can be accessed by accessing ssh and running linx after installation.

installing linx

```bash
sudo apt-get install lynx

```

Lynx Approach

```bash
lynx http://localhost/server-status

```

### mod_info

It provides various information about Apache.

info.conf and info.load are registered in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled.

```bash
sudo a2enmod info

```

```undefined
sudo vi /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/info.conf

<Location /server-info>
SetHandler server-info
Order deny,allow
