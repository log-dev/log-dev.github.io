The first JavaScript (JS) was introduced in early 2000. Unlike now, the perception of JS was not good, and it was difficult to find related knowledge. Compared to other programming languages, loose grammar and unsupported functions were compared and dismissed as low-level languages, and related books that started with such perception were terrible.

> Above all, it was a time when there was no concept of web standards, so if each browser was troubled with different support, it would naturally move away.

Another interest in JS was the emergence of jQuery, which reduced the convenience of DOM manipulation and the burden of cross-browsing. In addition, with the advent of Google`s V8 engine-equipped browsers, jQuery plugins and various libraries have emerged as they encounter a significantly improved environment. Since then, the period of envy while peeping at developers` ideas has continued until recently.

My current situation is that I have only changed the structure of the DOM, processed through Ajax, and coded the degree of event connection while using jQuery, and is only seen in low-level utilization that fills key functions with a usable library. What we`ve learned so far is that whatever it is, if it exists on the web, we can mimic ideas by attaching code fragments to plugins with similar functions.

As these things were repeated, things that theoretically could not be understood even if they were learned were repeated by necessity, so they naturally grasped the principles and were able to catch a glimpse of the developers` thoughts. Still, the understanding of grammar and abbreviated notation that existing developers have used conventionally confuses me with the difficulty of source decoding, but there is no denying that it is time to remind me of JS`s basic concepts that have faded in my head.

Although JS is learned by jQuery, it is time to peel off the jQuery and return to the pure JS. JS, which is expanding to various applications and servers, is JS, not jQuery. Using jQuery in many ways cannot ignore performance issues, and considering the current trend of abandoning support for older browsers, the problem of cross-browsing is naturally solved.

I decided to study JavaScript again.

I want to take a step forward by expanding my understanding of abstract objects, modularity, promise, etc. and utilizing them in practice. It is also planning to use various front-end tools that are being developed as JS, and it will build servers with Node.js and conduct various tests. I think it will pass like that this year...
