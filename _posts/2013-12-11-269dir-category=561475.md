### How do I set it up?

The best way to set up a Pavicon with cross-browsing in mind is to place the Pavicon file under the name favicon.ico at the root of the web service directory. If the file favicon.ico is located in the sub-directory without placing it in the root directory, the image path should be informed (created in the head) as shown in the syntax below.

```undefined
<head>
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/img/favicon.ico">
</head>

```

### Size and type of file

Prepare icon files with sizes 16x16 and 32x32. Icon files can be accommodated in a single file because they can be matched to multiple sizes. If you prepare files with images such as png, each browser will suffer from different compatibility.

### Mobile Response

On iOS 2.0 and later and Android 2.1 and later devices, it is inserted as follows.

```undefined
<link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" href="path/to/favicon-152.png">

```
