Preparing settings for WordPress...

The moment you try to access the remote using Xftp and copy the required files to another folder!!

Paste has not been activated.

I ran to the website of NetSarang and put in an inquiry regarding this.

Any answers that you return after a while will be copied from the original remote from FTP or SFTP.

So download it locally and put it back on the remote folder you want!

That is, there was no original command.
