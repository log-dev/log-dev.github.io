Responsive Web Design

Web designers have always had issues with supporting displays of various sizes, from 760 pixels wide laptop screens to desktop monitors. Furthermore, with the advent of smartphones and tablets, the size of displays that need to be considered has become more diverse.

So some companies build separate websites from mobile browsers.

However, if you don`t have enough time, money, and manpower to develop two types of sites and web server programs at the same time, it will probably be difficult to build a mobile-only website.

Fortunately, there is another way to support different sizes of displays with one website, the design technique`s name is `Response Web Design`, which uses several techniques to change the page layout according to the width of the browser screen.

For example, a smartphone browser uses a single-stage layout to fit the width of the screen, and a wider display uses a multi-stage layout.

### Fundamentals of reactive web manifolds

Named by a web design pioneer named Ethan Marcotte, the "Responsive Web Design" technique allows you to change the layout according to the width of your browser window.

Reactive web design, also known as RWD, allows users to provide pages with the easiest-to-read layout to fit their display size without creating multiple versions of the site.

RWD is not a single technology design technique, but combines several CSS and HTML technologies to create a page with a layout that fits the screen size.

RWD combines three concepts:

- The layout uses flexible grids.
- Flexible media is used for images and videos.
- Creating styles that fit the width of the screen is solved through CSS media query.

If you use a flexible grid, you do not create a fixed width layout. Because the size of the smartphone screen varies, so it doesn`t fit the fixed width layout at all. Instead, you should be able to grow or decrease the page to fit the display size.

This is related to the concept of flexible layout.

Flexible media should allow images or videos to be displayed in a given area.

In other words, the large monitor produces a large picture, and the small screen.

Finally, Media Query is a CSS technique that allows you to vary the style that you send to your browser depending on your current status.

For example, you might want a particular style to be rendered if the window is less than 480 pixels wide, and a different style to be applied if it is more than 760 pixels wide. Besides, it`s not something that can be based on broadness. You can also distinguish between styles that apply when your tablet is in landscape mode and styles that apply to high pixel aggregation displays, such as retina displays used on iPhones and iPads.

### Viewport of the web page to use for RWD

This article does not detail the viewport, but provides simple tips.

```undefined
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
```

The meta tag in HTML conveys additional information about the page contents and is suitable for placing it in the "head" area, i.e. above the "title" tag.

This meta tag can then be used to instruct the browser how to display the page.

where the viewport represents the browser`s screen, and the content property matches the width of the browser window to the display width.

In other words, the meta tag above allows mobile browsers to match the width of the browser screen to the actual width of the display instead of shrinking the screen.

There is a way to prevent page shrinkage without using meta `viewport` tags and always display them at 100% scale.

The CSS standardization organization has included the `@viewport` rule in the CSS.

This rule allows you to handle everything the meta viewport tag does within the style sheet.

This avoids adding `<meta> tags` to each HTML page.

Simply add the @viewport rule to the main style sheet.

```css
@viewport { width: device-width; }
```

You can place this rule at the top of the stylesheet, before all other styles.

Unfortunately, however, not all browsers support this rule at this time, and even supported browsers require manufacturer prefixes to function normally.

Please refer to the link below.

### Media Query

The concept of media query was introduced in CSS3.

With technology that allows you to choose the style that matches the width and height of the browser where the page will be sent, you can create a separate style for your smartphone, the style that fits your tablet, and the style that fits your desktop browser to display.

The goal of reactive design is to show the most readable page for site visitors. Usually, it means determining the optimal design based on the width of the browser.

Smartphones, tablets, and desktop monitors are most commonly used for web browsing, so you`ll be the first to think of these three types of displays.

However, there are many variations in these devices.

There are small smartphones, large smartphones, and 7-inch and 10-inch tablets. And the width varies by device.

So you have to remember what your goal is.

The goal of the reactive digin is to create pages that change to be readable by the width of the window.

So if you want to know when the first or second tier layout is good to see and when the fourth tier layout is good to see, you will have to test it differently from the width and layout of the window.

### Media Query Usage Strategy

Although it is recommended that you determine how to change the layout according to the display size through trial-and-error, there are a few things you typically do when you change the layout as a result of a media query.

Adjust the number.

Multilevel layout is good to see on large monitors or in tablet landscape mode, but not on smartphones.

If your tablet is also in portrait mode, a four-stage configuration can be excessive. It is usually recommended to change to a 2- and 3-stage configuration.

It is also recommended that you avoid float styles on mobile devices.

Avoiding float styles allows container tags containing content to be listed in vertical order.

Use a flexible width design.

If your desktop browser is targeted, you may want to use a high-width design, but a high-width design is not suitable for narrow screens on tablets and smartphones.

The 960-pixel fixed-width page will be too large for the 320 or 480-pixel screen on your smartphone. Therefore, it is recommended that you specify auto or 100% width of the element containing the content on your smartphone or tablet. That way, the fixed width design will be changed to a flexible design.

In other words, no matter the size of the phone screen, the width of the element will increase or decrease to match the width of the screen.

Reduce the margin.

If you put a space between page elements such as headings and images, it would be good to look relaxed on a 23-inch monitor.

However, on the small screen of a smartphone, the margin leads to distracting design and wastes space. In other words, it only increases the effort of scrolling.

If you reduce margin and padding values, you can put more on a small screen.

Adjust the font size.

On a desktop monitor, large headings and small plain text are good to see.

On mobile devices like smartphones, however, displaying the indicator too large will not only waste screen visibility but also reduce readability.

Please pay attention to the font size when writing media query styles.

Change the navigation menu.

On a display with a narrow screen width, there is much room for navigation space, so the menu configuration should be different.

In general, these menu configurations are often used to reduce the space occupied by navigation menus by dynamically changing them using JavaScript.

Hide unnecessary content on portable devices.

On the desktop, large amounts of text consisting of multiple layers can be read, but on the smartphone screen, it`s just a burden.

With CSS, information that mobile users think is unnecessary is designated as `display: none;` so that it can be hidden.

However, hiding the content means that visitors will not be able to see the information contained on the site.

If the information you found when you first visited the site on your desktop and later visited your smartphone again disappears, visitors may find it difficult.

In addition, even if you hide it with CSS, HTML code remains, so you`re wasting your bandwidth downloading information that you don`t want to display.

This problem is often the case with a lot of content on the site, and there is room for argument.

Use the background image.

If you put a 960-pixel wide banner on a page, any smartphone will zoom out on that page.

The small way to display images to fit your smartphone screen is to use a CSS background image.

Use different background images for appropriate media queries.

```css
.logo {
width: 980px;
height: 120px;
background-image: url('images/large_logo.png');
}

.logo {
width: 320px;
height: 60px;
background-image: url('images/small_logo.png');
}
```

### Define Breakpoint

Media querying technology allows you to send a set of styles to your browser that match the width of the screen.

Typically, you create three media queries using three change points.

One for smartphones, one for tablets, and the other for desktop monitors. The exact change point value varies from design to design and from device to device.

Usually, however, smartphone styles are applied to screens smaller than 480 pixels, tablet styles are used for browsers with 481 to 768 pixels wide, and desktop styles are applied to screens with a width greater than 769 pixels wide.

However, the final decision will vary depending on the design of the site. That is, it`s up to you.

### creating a media query

A query is a question to a web browser.

"Is the browser width 480 now?" If correct, the browser will bring up a style sheet that fits that size.

This is not much different from using a regular external style sheet.

```undefined
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/mobile.css" media="(width:480px)" >
```

You can see that the property media has been added to this standard style sheet link.

The property that specifies the conditions that the browser uses to select a style sheet. In the example above, the browser loads the external style sheet mobile.css when the user places its width at 480 pixels and sees the page.

And the query must be enclosed in parentheses. If you omit parentheses, the browser ignores the query.

And 480 in the example above is too specific. If the screen width of the user is smaller than that, how should we respond? Therefore, it is recommended that you specify the value as range when using media queries.

```undefined
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/mobile.css" media="(max-width:480px)" >
```

The value ` (max-width: 480px)` means "until the width of the screen is 480 pixels."

Therefore, if the browser width is 480 pixels, 320 pixels, or 200 pixels, the style in the mobile.css file will be applied.

There is also the `min-width` option.

The option you use to specify the minimum width of your browser can be useful when specifying styles to apply to screens larger than your smartphone or tablet.

For example, you can specify the following styles to apply to screens that are wider than 768 pixels wide, which is the width of a large number of tablets:

```undefined
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/desktop.css" media="(min-width:769px)" >
```

Therefore, for the style defined in desktop.css to take effect, the browser width must be 769 pixels, which is at least 1 pixel larger than 768 pixels.

Finally, `min-width` and `max-width` can be used simultaneously.

This allows you to apply a style to devices that are larger than smartphones and smaller than desktop monitors.

For example, the code below applies the style defined in tablet.css to tablets with a screen width of 768 pixels.

```undefined
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/tablet.css" media="(min-width:481px) and (max-width:768px)" >
```

The above code means that you must apply the styles defined in tablet.css from at least 481 pixels wide to at most 768 pixels wide.

### How to use the @import directive in a style sheet

The `@import` directive allows you to load other external stylesheets from inside or outside stylesheets.

This allows you to apply media queries to `@import`.

The `@import` directive can be used as follows:

```css
@import: url(css/mobile.css) (max-width: 320px);
```

Unfortunately, IE8 and other older versions of IE must use the previously mentioned response.js to recognise a media query. However, this refond.js does not work with the media query used in the @import directive.

Therefore, when you load a style sheet by applying a media query to @import, the old IE does not understand.

However, this issue is not that serious. This is because desktop browsers do not necessarily need to use media queries.

```css
'@importurl(css/base.css); /* Media query does not exist, so it applies to all devices */
@import url(css/medium.css) (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px);
@import url(css/small.css) (max-width: 480px);
```

### When you take a mobile device priority strategy

If you take a mobile device strategy first, you need to make a style that fits your mobile browser first.

You should then use media queries to modify the design to fit your tablet and desktop browser.

The basic structure of the stylesheet that you use to take a mobile device priority strategy can be created as follows:

```css
'/* CSS initialization style is created here */
/* Create a default style here for all devices, including mobile devices */
body {
/* Declaration of properties to be applied to body */
}

/* Define the style to be applied to medium display */
@media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px) {
body {
/* Declare properties that apply only to tablets */
}
}

/* Define the style to be applied to large displays */
@media (min-width: 769px) {
body {
/* Declare properties that apply only to large monitors */
}
}
```

### Disadvantages of floating images

Because information about how to use floating images is easy to obtain, this article explores the disadvantages of floating images.

There are several problems with floating images.

First, if you automatically expand the image based on the short width, the image quality can be reduced by increasing it beyond the original width of the image.

For example, suppose you put an image of 200 pixels wide in the sidebar. And let`s say you`re looking at this page as a big monitor. And as a result, the width of the sidebar increased to 300 pixels.

If the image width is set at 100%, the image will eventually be expanded to 300 pixels.

However, since the width of the original image has increased, the image will look very prominent like a mosaic photo.

Therefore, it should not be extended beyond that.

The second problem is that if you look at the page on your smartphone, each layer and image width will be much smaller than the desktop.

Therefore, the image becomes smaller when viewed on the smartphone than when viewed on the monitor.

While there is no problem with image quality degradation, users waste their bandwidth downloading high-quality images that are not seen much from a user`s perspective.

Unfortunately, there is no good solution to this problem yet.

In fact, pioneers of reactive web design see this as the biggest problem with RWD.

The W3C standardization organization is trying to solve this problem through HTML.

You can check the progress here.

At this point in time, the techniques mentioned in the link are not fixed and the browsers you support are insufficient, but there are other ways to use them.

One way is to use a rather complex solution called adaptive images.

This technology uses JavaScript and PHP to send images of the right size for the device.

This means that a small device receives a small image file for a small screen, and a desktop browser receives a large image for a large screen.

Please refer to adaptive image technology.

### Video and Flash

When you need to use a video tag in HTML5 or embedded Flash, you can also use max-width to resize it to fit the width of the tag outside.

It is possible if you add the style below.

```css
img, video, embed, object {
max-width: 100%;
}
```

Unfortunately, this style does not work for videos inserted using iframe.

Iframe is also a common tag for putting YouTube videos or Vimeo videos on a page.

If you want to insert a YouTube video, you will use JavaScript or CSS more.
