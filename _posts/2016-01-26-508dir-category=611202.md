One of the new features in Windows 10, virtual desktops are features that make multiple desktops available at the same time. You can switch screens for each task and use them to achieve the effect of having multiple monitors.

### Move Virtual Desktops

The movement between virtual desktops can be moved by selecting the desired desktop from the virtual desktop screen, or by using shortcuts Ctrl + Window() + ← and →.

You can also move programs in use from each desktop to another desktop, which you can drag to the desired desktop from the virtual desktop screen where the program is running. It can also be accessed through a menu using a mouse right click.

### Delete Virtual Desktops

When you mouse over the desktops at the bottom of the virtual desktop screen, a delete button appears. When deleted, the task windows displayed on the virtual desktop screen are moved to another virtual desktop screen, so there is no problem of losing work.

### Virtual Desktop Shortcuts

- Create: Ctrl + Window() + D
- Delete: Ctrl + Window() + F4
- 이동 : Ctrl + Window() + ←, →
- View: Window() + Tab

> I wondered if I needed a virtual desktop function to use three monitors, but it's very convenient to use. By granting the movement shortcuts between desktops to the auxiliary keys provided by the mouse, the switchover was also solved with a single finger, making it a very convenient workspace.

### Virtual Desktops in Previous Windows

There are programs that offer similar functionality even with older Windows that do not support virtual desktops. Among them, DEXPOT recommends that individual users try it because it is a free product line.
