### Introducing Sublime Text

Sublime Text is a lightweight, scalable editor, a tool used by many developers not only in Korea but also in foreign countries. Basically, it was developed with hard coding in mind, and its convenience is getting better as various plug-ins are attached.

The built-in Monokai theme is also popular and supports both OS X and Windows and Linux.

Sublime Text is currently being developed in two versions: Sublime Text2 and Sublime Text3. Sublime Text3 is a beta version, but is an enhancement to Sublime Text2 and is personally recommended for Sublime Text3.

We briefly introduce some of the beloved features in sublime text.

You can use the shortcut Ctrl + P to perform the following actions:

- You can find, open, and look into the contents of the file with just a few words of abbreviated key input.
- @By entering it as a symbol name, it moves to a specific symbol definition, such as a function.
- #By typing like a word, move to a specific word.
- : By entering the line number, move to the corresponding line.

> Above all, it is very convenient to find files. When a project is registered, it is recommended to locate files in the folders and files contained in the project.

You can use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P to perform multiple actions. Instead of visiting menus and running them or memorizing shortcuts, you can type some letters to find the command you want.

You can divide as many rows and columns as you want, and edit two locations in one file. If you use multiple monitors, you can edit each of them by running multiple sub-lime text.

Look at the split options in the View/Layout menu. To open multiple views in a single file, use the File/New View in the File menu item.
