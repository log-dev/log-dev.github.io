Learn about the different size units available in CSS. Currently, em and px are used a lot, but rem can also be used in parallel.

### Variable Size Units

A unit of relative size.

Em is a unit of letter size that you specify for an element. When em units are written, the scale is adjusted based on the letter size specified in the parent element. Thus, specifying 2em doubles the size of the parent element`s letter. It is often used to make the document layout flexible depending on the size of the letter.

ex is the unit corresponding to the height of the letter x in the current font contained in the element. The size of the ex units is associated with em, but is rarely used.

The term "rem" refers to the root element of an HTML document, "html", which has a relative value based on the size specified in the element.

```css
html { font-size: 62.5%; }
body { font-size: 14px; font-size: 1.4rem; }
h1 { font-size: 24px; font-size: 2.4rem; }

```

IE8 The point is to define the value for them first and then define the rem because the rem is not recognised.

### Fixed Size Units

A unit that is always maintained at a constant size without being affected by parents or other factors.

In means in inches. This is the logical inch of the screen and is different from the physical inch in reality. In fact, the physical size depends on the setting or monitor selected by the operating system or user, so in is sometimes described as a logical inch.

The actual size of the px units depends on the dot pitch of the monitor, and so does the actual size of the logical inches. Also, different operating systems have different dpi settings. Typically, Macintosh uses 72 dpi, Unix uses 75 dpi or 100 dpi, Windows uses 96 dpi or 120 dpi. In theory, the actual size of inches is greater at 120 dpi, which contains more dots than at 72 dpi. The element width of 96 dpi is equal to 1 in Windows and 1.33 in Macintosh with 72 dpi resolution.

Px stands for pixel. The px unit is recommended when elements need to be placed exactly in line with the image. This is because the size unit of the image is px.

pt stands for point. 1pt is 1/72in.

pc means pika. 1 pc is 12pt and 1/6in.

cm means the logical centimeter of a screen. One in is 2.54 cm.

mm means millimeters. One in is 25.4 mm.
