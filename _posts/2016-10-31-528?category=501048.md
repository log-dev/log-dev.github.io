Chaining pattern

A chaining pattern is a pattern that allows a method to be called in a chain to an object.

When performing multiple actions, you do not need to split the call across lines because you do not need to assign the return value of the action first to the variable and then do the following:

```js
myobj.method1('hello').method2().method3('world').method4();
```

If the method does not have a meaningful return value, it returns the object instance `this`, which is currently being worked on.

This allows users of the object to call the next method immediately following the previous method.

```js
var obj = {
value : 1,
increment : function () {
this.value += 1;
return this;
},
add : function (v) {
this.value += v;
return this;
},
shout : function () {
console.log(this.value);
}
};

// Call method chaining
obj.increment().add(2).shout(); // 4 is logged

// Unlike above, to call a method one by one, you must:
obj.increment();
obj.add(3);
obj.shout(); // Record 8'
```

Advantages and disadvantages of chaining patterns

The advantage of using a chaining pattern is that it reduces the amount of code and makes the code more concise, making it almost like a single sentence.

And through the chaining pattern, you`re thinking about how to break down functions, and you`re creating smaller, more specialized functions than functions that try to handle too much work alone.

In the long run, this method improves maintenance.

However, code written like this is difficult to debug.

Even if you find out which line of the code has an error, you may have too much work to do on that line.

If one of the multiple methods fails, it is difficult to determine which method failed.

Robert Martin, author of "Clean Code," called the situation a "train accident" pattern.

Anyway, it`s helpful to know this pattern.

If a method does not have a clearly meaningful return value, it always causes this to return.

This pattern is widely used in jQuery libraries, etc.

If you look into the DOM API, you can see that the elements of DOM also tend to use the chaining pattern.
