### Placeholders.js 소개

A JavaScript polyfill for HTML5 placeholder properties. It is lightweight and available in all browsers.

- It applies to input and textarea elements.
- It tries to render the browser`s native style and adds a class called placeholdersjs to modify the style.
- By default, it does not affect browsers that support the placeholder property.
- It works with IE6+ and later, does not require any additional things, and consists of a small JavaScript file of 4kb.
- In IE 8, the password type placeholder of the input element is expressed as ****.
- Plugins are also available for jQeury, Proroype, and YUI3. You can download it from the homepage.

### How to use Placeholders.js

Create a form control to use in HTML.

```html
<input type="text" name="name" placeholder="e.g. John Doe" />
<input type="password" name="password" placeholder="e.g. h4x0rpr00fz" />
<textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message goes here"></textarea>

```

Download placeholders.js and load them properly at the end of the page.

```html
<script src="placeholders.min.js"></script>

```

### Placeholders.js 옵션

Additional functions can be set using `data-*` attribute values for `<html` element.

- `data-placeholder-focus="false"`
In IE, the placeholder letter disappears when the input element is in focus, but when the false value is set, it does not disappear when it is in focus, but only when it is entered.
- `data-placeholder-live="false"`
Set the false value if you do not want to update the placeholder when changing through JavaScript or adding new elements to the page after loading. If you are aware that this method does not change the page, you should always set it to false.
