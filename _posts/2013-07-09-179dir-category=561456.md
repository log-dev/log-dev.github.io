This document describes the major changes between Apache HTTP Server 2.0 and 2.2 versions. For new features from 1.3, please see the http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/new_features_2_0.html documentation.

### Key enhancements

The authentication and permission modules that are included together have been refactored. The new mod_authn_alias module is very simple and reliable to set up authentication. You can get more information from renaming modules and changing developers.

Mod_cache, mod_disk_cache, and mod_mem_cache have changed a lot, and now I think they have quality as products. htcacheclean introduces how to delete mod_disk_cache settings.

The default layout is simple and modular. Parts of the widely used settings are now included in the Apache and can now be easily added to the Main Server settings.

Prefork, worker, and event multifunction modules can now be safely shut down via the gracful-stop signal. The GracefulShutdownTimeout directive has been added to specify a timeout value, which allows httpd to exit after a certain period of time without considering the request.

The new mod_proxy_balancer module regulates the load of mod_proxy. The new mod_proxy_ajp module is added to support Apache JServ Protocol version 1.3 used by Apache Tomcat.

Perl Regular Expression Library (PCRE) 5.0 is included. httpd can install PCRE through the --with-pcre flag.

The mod_filter can dynamically configure the output filter chain. This allows filters to be added selectively depending on the request, response header, or environment variable, separating them from the dependencies and alignment problems that existed in the 2.0 architecture.

httpd now supports files larger than 2GB on 32-bit Unix systems. Support for request bodies larger than 2GB has also been added.

The event multiprocessing module handles keepalive requests and uses them to accept connections. Keep alive requests traditionally required httpd for workers to handle requests. The worker handling this request will not be able to be used again until the keep alive timeout is reached.

mod_dbd supports direct SQL for the modules required with the apr_dbd framework, and connection pooling for threaded MPMs.

### Module Enhancements

Modules in the aaa directory are renamed and provided with enhanced support for authentication processing. For example, mod_auth is now separated into mod_auth_basic and mod_authn_file, mod_auth_dbm is now called mod_authn_dbm, and mod_access is replaced with mod_authz_host. The new mod_authn_alias module has also been added to simplify authentication settings.

This module is port to the Authn/Authz framework in 2.2 of the mod_auth_ldap module of version 2.0. Includes new features such as LDAP attribute values and complex search filters in the Require directive.

A new module for access authentication based on the owner of the file in the file system.

This is a new module that can activate the setup block according to the version of the Apache in action.

A new ?config factor has been added, which shows the setup instructions parsed by the Apache, including their file names and line numbers. The module also shows the processing order of all requests and additional build information similar to httpd-V.

RFC 2817 is supported to allow TLS encryption connections in .

mod_imap has been renamed mod_imagemap to avoid confusion.

### Program Improvement

A new command line option -M has been added to list all modules loaded from the current settings. Unlike the -l option, this reset contains DSOs loaded through mod_so.

A new program that generates dbm files via text input and is used for dbm map-type RewriteMap.

### Module Developer Change

Apache 2.2 uses the APR 1.0 API. All deprecated functions and symbols were removed from APR and APR-Util. Please refer to the APR website for more information website.

The authentication and permission modules have been renamed as follows:

modules implementing the mod_auth_* -> HTTP authentication procedure

mod_authn_* -> modules responsible for providing back-end authentication

modules implementing mod_authz_* -> authorization (or access permission)

mod_authnz_* -> modules that implement authentication and authorization.

The new backend authentication provider is planned for very easy backend authentication generation.

A new function, ap_log_cerror, is added to log connection-related errors from the client. Include the client`s ip when logging.

A new hook, test_config, was added to allow the module to execute special code only when the user gave -t to httpd.

A new directive, ThreadStackSize, has been added to set the stack size for all the threaded MPMs. This is required for several third-party modules on platforms with small base stack sizes.

In the past, all filters had an obligation to ensure that they generated accurate response headers for the responses they affected. Filters now manage normal protocol management by calling ap_register_output_filter_protocol or ap_filter_protocol in mod_filter.

Monitor hooks enable normal/scheduled tasks to operate in the root process.

The pcreposix.h header is no longer valid, and it has been replaced with a new ap_regex.h header. In the old header, the regex.h implementation part of POSIX.2 is now available in the ap_ namespace of ap_regex.h. Calls such as regcomp, regexec have been replaced with ap_reg_comp, ap_regexec.

In Apache 1.X and 2.0, modules needed a SQL backend to take responsibility for their SQL management. Apart from redevelopment, this was inefficient, for example, some modules maintained their own connections.

Apache 2.1 and later versions provide the pa_dbd API for database connection management (including optimization policies for threads and non-threaded MPMs), although APR 1.2 and later versions provide the apr_dbd API for database interaction.

New modules must now use them for all SQL database commands. The existing application that can be used needs to be upgraded.
