Learn about PHP constants.

### PHP Constant

A constant is an unchanging number that always has the same value and can be used as a global variable once set.

- Once set, the value cannot be changed.
- It distinguishes case by case, but is routinely capitalized.
- Define constants using the function `define()`.

```php
<?php
define ("NAME", Hong Gil-dong);
echo NAME; //Hong Gil Dong Output
?>

```

Like the constant variables, there are predefined constants. Let`s refer to the reservation constant.
