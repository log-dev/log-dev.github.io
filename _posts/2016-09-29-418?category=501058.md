JavaScript and Java

What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.

It`s a small and light language. Within a hosted environment (a command, web browser), JavaScript can be connected to objects in that environment to provide program control.

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects such as Array, Date, Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.

Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.

For example:

- Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by providing objects that control the browser and document object model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow the application to place elements in an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form inputs, and page navigation.
- Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by providing objects related to JavaScript execution on the server. For example, server-side extensions allow the application to communicate with the database, provide continuity of one call information elsewhere in the application, or perform file manipulation on the server.

### JavaScript 와 Java

JavaScript and Java are similar in many ways, but they are fundamentally different in some ways.

The JavaScript language resembles Java, but does not have a strong typography and static typing in Java.

JavaScript follows most Java syntax, naming conventions, and basic flow control structures. That was why the name changed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

Unlike compilation-time systems of classes created by Java`s declaration, JavaScript supports runtime systems based on a small number of data types that represent numeric, Boolean, and string values.

JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.

The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance.

In other words, the inherited target can vary depending on each object.

JavaScript also supports functions that do not require any specific declaration. A function can be a property of an object, or a method in which a type is loosely formatted.

JavaScript is a very free form of language compared to Java.

You do not need to declare all variables, classes, and methods.

You don`t have to worry about whether the method is public, private, or protected, and you don`t have to implement the interface.

The variable, parameter, and function return type are not explicitly specified.

Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety.

Formal safety means, for example, that you cannot access private memory by cashing Java integers into references to objects or by changing Java byte codes.

Java`s class-based model means that programs consist solely of classes and their methods.

Class inheritance and strong formatting in Java usually require a tightly coupled object hierarchy.

This demand makes Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.

JavaScript, on the other hand, comes down from smaller, dynamic language lines such as HyperTalk and dBASE.

These scripting languages offer programming tools to even more people due to easier syntax, special built-in features, and minimum requirements for object creation.

### JavaScript 와 ECMAScript 명세

JavaScript is standardized at Ecma International to provide a standardized international programming language based on JavaScript.

— European association for standardizing information and communication systems (ECMA는 이전에 European Computer Manufacturers Association의 두문자어였습니다).

This standardized version of JavaScript, called ECMAScript, works in the same way for all applications that support the standard.

Companies can use open standard language to develop their JavaScript implementations.

The ECMAScript standard is documented in the ECMA-262 specification.
