Location Properties and Methods for Window Objects

The window object is the top-level object of the browser object model (BOM) object, and let`s find out the properties and methods associated with the window pane and the location and size associated with the window pane when the web page is open.

### Get window size

The window size consists of a combination of a menu bar, a toolbar, and a scrollbar area, and the size associated with the window can be divided into three sizes:

1. Default Size

- window.innerWidth

2. Default size + Menu bar + Size with toolbar area

- $(window).width()

3. Default size + Menu bar + Toolbar + Size with scrollbar area

- window.outerWidth

Please refer to the following illustration for the three explanations above.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="379" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/EVMPdw?height=379&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=EVMPdw&amp;default-tab=js&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_EVMPdw"></iframe>

You can`t check the result window source of the code pen above, so test html, css, and js locally.

Check the value changes by refreshing while changing the web browser window.

### Location Properties and Methods for Document Objects

Although there are no separate profiles related to the size of Document, HTMLElement`s body properties, scrollWidh, scrollHeight, can be used to obtain width and height.

The `elementFromPoint()` method also allows the element to be located in the x and y positions of the mouse pointer.
