It`s a short article that contains things that you should keep in mind for beginners of CSS.

### CSS Definition

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. CSS is designed to separate the content of the document from the appearance (design) of the document, which is represented by its layout, font, and visual elements.

CSS specifications are managed by the World Wide Web Consortium. CSS has three main levels defined, which can be considered a version or generation, and CSS1, CSS2, and CSS3 are now defined.

### CSS Properties

- Multiple attribute values must be separated by spaces.
- Abbreviated representation properties can apply multiple attribute values as a single simplified declaration.
- If a property is not specified, the default value for that property is applied.

- In most cases, rules are preferred to be defined in an external CSS file, as multiple HTML elements and HTML documents can be controlled by a single rule.
- HTML annotation tags (`<!-->`) are used to hide CSS code from incompatible browsers.

It uses HTML`s `link` tag to include external files.

```html
<head>
<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>

```

Using the `@import` CSS declaration, include external CSS files in the following locations:

- The document`s `<head>` tag
- A different CSS file, where one CSS file can nest multiple different CSS files.

```html
<head>
<style type="text/css">
@import url(style.css);
</style>
</head>

```

CSS rules can be declared using the `style` tag.

```html
<head>
<style type="text/css">
.logo {color: #eeeeee;}
</style>
</head>

```

Use the style property of HTML to assign inline styles to elements in the tag "body" of HTML documents.

```html
<body>
<p style="height:100px; color:blue">
</body>

```

### CSS Basic Grammar

CSS rules are divided into selectors and declarations. The declaration part is divided back into properties and values.

- The selector usually has an HTML element or ID or class that you want to style.
- When there are multiple attributes and attribute values in a declaration, they are separated by ; (semicolons).
- Each declaration divides the attribute from the attribute value by : (colon).

### CSS Priority

Although CSSs are basically applied in the declared order, their priorities may vary depending on the various selectors and insertion locations.

!important > Inline Style > ID Selector > Class/Properties/Virtual Selector > Tag Selector > Full Selector

If a competitive rule belongs to the same group of selectors, the type and number of selectors determine the priority. In other words, rules that use more high-priority selectors win.

- Style elements in the <head> element
- @import statement in the <style> element
- CSS files connected to the > element
- The @import statement in the CSS file that the 요소로 element connects to.
- CSS files that end users connect to
- Browser`s default style sheet

As an exception, `!important` rules in CSS files that end users connect to are priority number one. End users can write !important rules to override the rules in CSS files created by the website designer.

When multiple CSS files are connected and inserted in the same priority location, the priority is determined by the sequence of connections/inserts. The last connected/inserted style sheet has a higher priority than the previous style sheet.

Consider that priorities should be kept as simple as possible.

- Minimize the number of CSS files you connect to
- Do not use `@import` statements
- Sort the selectors in the intended order within each CSS file
