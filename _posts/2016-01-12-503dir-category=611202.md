After installing Windows 10, I gathered some basic settings that would be helpful. Let`s use search rather than complicated menus or lists to reach the set point.

### adding icons to the desktop

If your desktop does not have a default icon (computer, trash, documentation, control panel, IE11), try adding an icon to your desktop to make it easier to access.

- Search background to select Show/Hide common icons on the desktop
- Select and apply the desired icon
- Search over the Internet, right-click any of the search results in Internet Explorer, and choose Open
- Copy a shortcut to Internet Explorer from a moved location to your desktop
- Search for other frequently used programs, turn the executable into a shortcut, and copy it to your desktop

### Browser Settings

Starting with Windows 10, the built-in browser was changed to Edge, and due to its poor compatibility with domestic sites using ActiveX and NPAPI, the following screens are frequently encountered.

If you choose to continue on Microsoft Edge, most of them will be connected normally, but if you are not happy to see this message, enter `about:flags` in the address bar and disable the use of Microsoft compatibility lists in the developer settings, the message does not appear.

The Edge browser displays the default screen as a news screen, which can be changed through the Settings menu.

Select Custom from the drop-down menu on a specific page of Open with another program.

Enter the desired address in the Web address field (ex. www.naver.com) to open the page when the browser is launched and you can add or delete the number.

The Edge browser uses the default search Bing to search. Let`s change this.

Go to the site that provides the search engine (ex. google.co.kr) and select View Advanced Settings from the Settings menu.

Under Search in the Address bar, under Enable, select Change.

Select the search engine searched and set it to its default value. Afterwards, the search engine will be used when searching using the address window.

Set IE11 or other browsers other than Edge as the default browser.

- Search by default app to select default app settings
- Select a web browser to select the desired browser as the default browser
