You`ve probably heard the terms Polyfill, Shims, Fallback. Although the terms are incorrect, each purpose is to implement functions that are different from browser to browser. That is, cross-browsing is in mind.

### What is a polyfill?

Polyfill is a code snippet or plug-in that a developer can use for browsers that do not support certain features. Polyfilm is responsible for filling the gap between HTML5 and CSS3 and older browsers.

### HTML5 Cross Browser Polyfills

Referring to the list of polyfills organized and provided by Modernizr will help you select the desired technology. The things that I often use are as follows.

- html5shiv : Library for browsers that do not support the segmentation elements of HTML5 (e.g. >, >)
- mediaelement.js : a library to provide the same UI as a file in every browser for the <video> and <audio> elements of HTML5
- Placeholder: Library provided to unify the support of placeholders in HTML5
- h5Validate : Library provided to implement form verification functionality of HTML5
- selectivizr : a library to support pseudo-class and attribute selectors in CSS3 in IE6-8
- css3pie : a library for supporting border-radius, box-shadow, and liner-gradient in CSS3 in IE6-9 browsers
- Response: Library for supporting media queries in IE6-8 which is one of the essential attributes of the reactive web

Mozilla is also looking for an easy way to use polyfill, so please refer to an easier way to use polyfill.
