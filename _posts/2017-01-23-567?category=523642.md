Validate Array Content Using Every, Some Array Method

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/261DF04458A5619109)

```js
If you want to verify that the array meets certain conditions, you can use the every method of Array objects.
// verify that all elements pass the condition.
// For example, the following code is an example of verifying that all elements in an array are alphabetic and numeric.

var arrElement = [123, 'aaa', 'abc', '-', 33, 'DDD'];
var arrElement2 = ['aaa', 'abc','DDD'];

// Function to test
function textValue(el, idx, arr) {
var textExp = /^[a-zA-Z]+$/;
return textExp.test(el);
}

// Run Test
var result = arrElement.every(textValue);
var result2 = arrElement2.every(textValue);

console.log(result, result2);

// The some method of Array objects lets you determine if there is at least one element that satisfies a given condition.
var arr = [123, 'aaa', 'abc', '-', 33, 'DDD'];

var result3 = arr.some(textValue);
console.log(result3);
```

The every and some methods of Array objects are not executed for all elements.

That is, when using the every method, if the function`s return value is false, the callback function`s execution (action) stops and the method returns false.

On the other hand, the some method continues to check the element until the function returns true.

However, if the callback function examines all elements and does not return true at any point, the some method returns false.

The method you use depends on your needs.

If you want to know if all array elements meet the conditions, you can use every, otherwise some.
