call/apply and constructor

When call / apply is used in the constructor, you can import and define instance members defined in another constructor.

Suppose you have the following person, Korean constructor.

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}

function Korean(city) {
this.city = city;
}
```

You can use call/apply if you want to import instance members defined in Person from Korean.

```js
function Korean(city) {
// Call/apply to the constructor person.
Person.call(this, name) // Person.apply(this, [name])
this.city = city;

}
```

When you call Person.call (this, name) inside the Korean constructor, this is the currently created Korean instance.

Eventually, if you define a member through this inside the person constructor, the member will become a member of the Korean instance.
