# Typography Design

Typhography is literally about doing graphics with typos, or decorating text (text) designs for ease of reading.

CSS has two main properties, one for typography, one for font style and one for text layout.

## Font style properties

You can specify which attributes affect the font: family, size, weight, and style.

- font-family : specify font type
- font-size : specify font size
- font-weight : specify font thickness (thickness)
- font-style : Specifies the style (italics) of the font

font-family

The `font-family` property defines the type of font used for that element.

Usually used by specifying multiple font names rather than one, the browser chooses and renders supported fonts in the order they are defined.

If the browser does not support the first font type, it automatically renders the second font.

This property contains a collection of fonts that share common characteristics such as magnification, clear Gothic, and Nanum font that we are familiar with.

It can be seen as a collection of font shapes.

One thing to be careful about when declaring a font family is that in case of Korean fonts, you have to tie them in strings.

For example, `font-family:`Growth`, Dotum;`

Also, each font name is separated by a comma (,) and if the font name has a spacing, it must be enclosed in quotation marks.

And a font, not a system font, or a font designed to be used on the web, but a font designed to be used as a system font rather than an image on a web service, which places the font on a server and must also be converted to serve all browsers.

```css
body {
font-family:'돋움', Dotum, arial, sans-serif;
}
```

font-style

Font styles are usually used in italic, normal, and italics are slanted, and normal is a regular font without a slope.

font-size

Font size is defined and font units can be specified when size is declared, such as px, em, % pc, rem, etc.

```css
div { font-size:12px; }
div { font-size:100%; }
```

font-weight

`font-weight` usually uses normal, bold to define font thickness.

When the strong element declares the value of this property, normal, it is expressed in plain bold.

Also, you can specify the thickness from 100 to 900 in numbers, but it is not used well because it is not compatible according to the font type.

However, in the case of web fonts, the thickness of the font is customized to a number when producing the font, and in this case, the value can be used.

For example, if you have a font named monoLight, there will be normal in this font, and if the normal body is declared 500, if the bold is declared 700, then it is compatible to use the font by explicitly declaring it 500 or 700.

font

`font` is an abbreviated property that defines all font attributes as one.

Some of the attributes that can be included are `font-style`, `font-weight`, `font-size/line-weight`, and `font-family`, among which `font-size` and `font-family` are essential values.

If either value is not created, it is set to the default value.

```css
.box { font: 16px/1.5 Verdana; }
```

Font shortening properties are the most popular method, and the aforementioned size and font type order should be both used, but you can declare line-height by separating them into slashes.

Also note that you must create a slash between the font size and line-height without spaces.

Putting a line spacing in the font declaration is optional, but once you`ve decided to put it in, it`s only available in the designated location.

## Text Layout Properties

Properties that affect text spacing, layout, and more can be arranged between lines, spacing between letters, spacing between words, sorting, deformation, decoration, shadowing, etc.

line-height

The `line-height` property specifies the height value for a line.

In addition, letter-spacing allows negative values, but between rows does not allow negative values.

To be exact, you can increase or decrease the vertical space between rows that are lines.

You can assign a number or a percentage, em, px, and so on as a value. Cannot specify a negative value

The default value is normal and may differ in the browser, but Chrome is assigned 1.25.

Therefore, it is common to declare this value explicitly during CSS initialization operations.

When declared as a number, you specify how many times the current font size should be.

If the current font is 14px, line-height: 1.5, then line spacing is specified as 21px height.

text-decoration

The `text-decoration` property, which specifies the decoration of the text, is related to the line style, which has an effect on the text.

- `underline` : Specify a line under text (underline effect)
- `Overline` : Specify a line above the text (top line effect)
- `line-through` : Center lines in text

```css
h1 {
text-decoration: overline;
}
h2 {
text-decoration: line-through;
}
h3 {
text-decoration: underline;
}
```

text-indent

Specifies the indentation of the first line of text.

This property is used to indent only the first line of paragraph text and is expressed like an out-write when a negative value is declared.

```css
p { text-indent:20px; }
```

text-align

Use to specify horizontal alignment of inline attributes.

That is, this property is used to sort documents horizontally.

- left : Align inline elements to the left
- right : align inline elements to the right
- center : Align inline elements centrally

Many creators often misunderstand the character (text) as a property that aligns the letters (text) on a horizontal line.

This property has the following characteristics:

- The destination that defines this property can only be applied to the block element (Flow Content).
- Only the `inline-block` element within the block element can be sorted.
- Inline elements that are aligned include `img`, `a`, and `input` elements.. The important thing is that the text is also an inline element.

letter-spacing

The `letter-spacing` property specifies whether the spacing between characters within the text is narrow and wide.

That is, specify the width of the interval between the digits.

```css
h1 { letter-spacing:1px; }
h2 { letter-spacing:-1px; }
```

vertical-align

The `vertical-align` property specifies the vertical alignment of an element.

If you think that this property is simply vertical alignment, you may have difficulty controlling the CSS.

Understanding which elements this property applies to and how it aligns makes it easier to control CSS.

This property is only available on the inline and inline block elements in the CSS, and uses `vertical-align` to sort these elements vertically.

Exceptionally, the table cell within `table` does not vertical align the elements, but vertical align the content area.

The `vertical` property has the following characteristics:

- It only applies to the `inline` or `inline-block` elements mentioned earlier.
Therefore, this property does not work for block elements such as div.
- Sorts only the elements themselves and does not affect the contents of the elements (except when applied to table cells).
So if you apply it to the table cell, it also affects the contents.
- The elements you want to sort by `vertical-align` will be aligned relative to other inline elements.
Therefore, the height may vary depending on the size of the inline element in the same line, and the value declared in `line-height`.

white-space

Using the `white-space` property can give you the effect of using pre elements.

The white-space has the following attribute values:

- normal : as it is
- pre : Preserve text as entered as if using pre element
- pre-line : removes indented spaces from effects such as using pre elements
- nowrap: Rendered in one line to mean no wrapping

word-break

`word-break` is a property that determines how a word is separated, and `word-wrap` is a property that is involved in changing the line by determining whether it is separated or not within a word that overflows the horizontal area of the box.

```css
/*
(blank/spacing) Good job today.
Thank you for your hard work today.
*/
p {word-break:break-all;}

p {word-wrap:break-word;}
```

text-shadow

`text-shadow` is the property of shadowing letters.

```css
/* text-shadow: x y blur spread color; */
h1 {
text-shadow:4px 4px 0 #9bdbde;
text-shadow:0 -3px 0 #9bdbde,
0 3px 10px #943978;
}
```
