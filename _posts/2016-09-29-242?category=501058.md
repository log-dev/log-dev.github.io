void operation

void is a unary undefined operator.

Whatever you specify as an operand, the result of the operation is the undefined value.

Let`s take a look at the specifically.

```js
The operand is a number.
console.log(void 0); // undefined 가 기록

// Operand String
console.log (void "string"); // written by undefined

var x = 0;
void x++; // x is increased because the operand is evaluated first.
console.log(x); // 1 record this

console.log(void(x)); // enclosed operands in parentheses runs well and undefined outputs'
```

It`s a hard operator to know where to use it, but some of them are idioms in client-side JavaScript.

The following example is a JavaScript code that sends content in a form when you click a tag in HTML.

```undefined
<a href="javascript:void(document.form.submit())">
Sends an HTML form, but does not move the screen.
</a>
```

If the expression written to the href property has an evaluation value, the action of the tag a interprets it as a URL and lets it move to that page.

To stop the action of these a tags, you can make sure that the expression written to the href property is the undefined value.
