Learn how to set up APC, one of PHP`s modules, in CentOS 6.4 Minimal.

### APC Configuration

```bash
vi /etc/php.d/apc.ini

; The size of each shared memory segment, with M/G suffix
apc.shm_size=128M

```

Copy /usr/share/php-pecl-apc/apc.php and save it to the root of the web folder to serve and view it on the web.

```bash
service httpd configtest

Syntax OK

```

```bash
service httpd restart

Stopping httpd: [OK]
Starting httpd: [OK]

```

By default, after APC is installed, the APC cache setting in the /etc/php.d/apc.ini file is On (1=On, 0=off).

```undefined
apc.cache_by_default=1

```

This is a huge amount of memory utilization if you are running a large number of websites with virtualhost. Therefore, the use of APC should be permitted or prohibited only on the desired site.

1) First, change the default setting to disable APC cache.

```bash
vi /etc/php.d/apc.ini

apc.cache_by_default=0

```

2) Add the contents below to the .htaccess file in the web root folder of virtualhost that you want to be cached.

```undefined
php_flag apc.cache_by_default On

```

Or add content to virtualhost`s settings that you want to cache as shown below.

```undefined
<IfModule mod_php5.c>
php_flag apc.cache_by_default On
</IfModule>

```

Conversely, by default, the contents of virtualhost`s website, which does not want APC to be cached while enabled, are modified as shown in "php_flag apc.cache_by_default Off".
