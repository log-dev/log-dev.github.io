Under the pledge of `New Year~!`, we organized the system, upgraded to Windows 10, and settled safely. Organize the installation sequence related to it.

### Windows 10 Upgrade Notification

When an upgrade is ready for the existing system, the following notification appears.

In addition, a hidden folder called $Windows.~BT exists on the drive where Windows is installed, which accounts for approximately 3–6Gb of capacity in the folder where Windows 10 installation files are pre-downloaded. It is also used to return to previous versions of Windows after the upgrade to Windows 10.

Before starting the upgrade in earnest, check your system one last time. Let`s check the Windows version, system type, authentication status, etc.

### Windows 10 Upgrade

You can start the upgrade by clicking on the notification window on the taskbar, or by clicking on the Windows logo.

Even if there is a $Windows.~BT folder, the download will proceed again, but the file I received in advance doesn`t seem to be a complete file.

Once the download is complete, consent to the license agreement is obtained and the upgrade installation is ready.

If you choose to start the upgrade now, the upgrade will proceed in earnest.

The update file is configured before the upgrade starts and automatically reboots.

After rebooting, Windows 10 upgrades are followed by file copy → functionality and driver installation → setup configuration.

While configuring the settings, you select the account to use.

Afterwards, the Windows setup will be finalized after legal notices, preferences, and app selection, and a few more messages will appear and the upgrade of Windows will be completed. Basically, it inherits the programs and settings that were installed in the previous window.

First of all, when the installation is complete, let`s check the installation information and authentication by selecting the system from the menu that appears with the mouse click on the start menu.

This concludes the installation process.
