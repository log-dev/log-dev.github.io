Explain another way to increase accessibility, ARIA.

### Define WAI-ARIA

The role property introduced by HTML5 allows all elements of the page to play a role. This makes it very easy for screen readers to analyze pages and classify all roles to index pages.

Role attributes were proposed in the WAI-ARIA specification and incorporated into the HTML5 specification. The role of landmark and document is definitely set and can be used right now.

### Landmark role

Signage roles indicate interesting places on the site. These include banners, search areas, and navigation that need to be quickly recognized by screen readers.

| Role | Purpose |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| banner represents the banner area of the page. |
| search | represents the search area of the page. |
| navigation | represents the navigation elements on the page. |
| main | Indicates that the main content of the page begins. |
| contentinfo | indicates where information about the content, such as copyright information, date of publication, etc. |
| complement | supplement the main content of the page, but in itself it represents meaningful content. |
| application | Indicates the area containing the web application, not the web document. |

> Usually, when you think of banners, you think of advertisements, but the expression banner here literally means that they are hung conspicuously.

```html
<header id="page-header" role="banner">
<h1>UZURO</h1>

<nav id="lnb" role="navigation">
<ul>
<li><a href="">HOME</a></li>
<li><a href="">MENU1</a></li>
</ul>
</nav>
<input type="text" role="search" />
</header>

<main role="main">
<aside role="complementary">
<ul>
<li><a href="#">Category 1</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Category 2</a></li>
</ul>
</aside>
</main>

<footer id="footer" role="contentinfo">
<address>
연락처: <a href="mailto:webmaster@somedomain.com">help@uzuro.com</a>
</address>
<small>
```

The HTML5 specification sets the basic role of some elements, which cannot be arbitrarily changed. The nav element must act as navigation and technically does not need to be explicitly specified. However, there are screen readers who recognize the ARIA role but have not yet accepted these defaults, so it is better to write them explicitly.

### Document Structure Role

| Role | Purpose |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| documnet | Represents the area containing the content of the document and is distinct from the content of the application. |
| article | indicates that it forms an independent part. |
| definition | indicates that a concept or topic is defined. |
| directory | lists referencing the same group in turn, used for static content. |
| heading | Represents the title of the section. |
| img | represents the part containing the image elements, may be the element representing the image, may be the descriptive text or caption. |
| list | Represents a group of list items that are not interactive. |
| list item | Indicates one list item that is not interactive. |
| math | represents a mathematical representation. |
| note | indicate the insertion or supplementation of the main content. |
| presentation | denotes negligible expressive elements in auxiliary techniques. |
| row | represent a row in tabular data (grid). |
| rowheader | represents a cell containing header information in a row. |

The document role is useful in documents that contain dynamic and static content.

```html
<body role="document">

```
