Mix-in as a function

Let`s take a closer look at how to use mix-in.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/26191950574B7B1C17)

### Mixins as Functions (return variable or mix from mix-in)

The variables defined in the mix-in and the mix-in can be represented and used in the caller range.

The only exception is not copied if the caller contains variables with the same name.

For the same name, it contains variables defined by another mix of calls.

Only variables that exist within the call local range are protected.

Variables inherited from the parent scope will be overwritten.

```css
.caller {
.mixin();
width: @width;
height: @height;
}
```

```css
.caller {
width: 100%;
height: 200px;
}
```

The variables defined in the mix-in as above can serve as their return values.

And the user can create a mix-in that can be used almost like a function.

```css
.average(@x, @y) {
@average: ((@x + @y) / 2);
}

div {
.average (16px, 50px); // a mixed-in call
padding: @average; // use a mix-in return
}

```

```css
div {
padding: 33px;
}
```

The variables defined directly within the call scope are not overridden as variables in the global range and are overwritten by the variables defined in the call parent range.

```css
.mixin() {
@size:in-mixin; // overridden within caller
@definedOnlyInMixin: in-mixin;
}

.class {
margin: @size @definedOnlyInMixin;
.mixin();
}

@size:globaly-defined-value; // the caller's parent area - unprotected

.global-var {
content: '@{size}';
}
```

```css
.class {
margin: in-mixin in-mixin;
}
.global-var {
content: 'globaly-defined-value';
}
```

Finally, the internally defined mix-in, which is a mix, serves as a return value.

```css
*.unlock(@value) { // external (parent) mix-in
.doSomething() { // nested mix-in
declaration: @value;
}
}

#namespace {
.unlock (5); // forward 5 to the unlock mix-in
.doSomething(); // Nested Mix-in is available here
}
```

```css
#namespace {
declaration: 5;
}
```

### Passing Rulesets to Mixins

A user`s rule set can include it in another structure and copy all the properties of the rule set to another structure.

It can also be used as an argument for mix-in and passed to it as a different variable.

```css
'// Declare a separate rule set
@detached-ruleset: {
background: red;
padding: 10px;
};

// Using a Separated Rule Set
.top {
@detached-ruleset(); // () parenthesis required
}
```

```css
.top {
background: red;
padding: 10px;
}
```

Parentheses () are required after the separated rule set as shown above.

Invoking `@detached-ruleset;` without parentheses does not work.

This is useful if you want to define a mix-in by wrapping or abstracting part of the code from any media query or unsupported browser class name.

The rule set can be delivered to the mix-in to wrap the contents.

```css
.desktop-and-old-ie(@rules) {
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
@rules();
}
html.lt-ie9
```

```css
header {
background-color: blue;
}
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {
header {
background-color: red;
}
}
html.lt-ie9 header {
background-color: red;
}
```

As shown above, desktop-and-old-ie mix-ins define media queries, root classes, and wrap the mix-in into pieces of code.

The rule set can be assigned to the current variable or passed to the mix-in to include the entire set.

```css
@my-ruleset-01: {
.my-selector {
background-color: black;
}
};

.demo-01 {
@my-ruleset-01();
}
```

```css
.demo-01 .my-selector {
background-color: black;
}
```

Users can also leverage media query bubbleing. For example:

```css
@my-ruleset-02: {
line-height: 1.5;
.my-selector {
@media tv {
background-color: black;
}
}
};

@media (orientation:portrait) {// is bubbled and merged into the media query defined in the rule set above.
padding: 10px;
@my-ruleset-02();
}
```

```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
padding: 10px;
line-height: 1.5;
}
@media (orientation: portrait) and tv {
.my-selector {
background-color: black;
}
}
```

When you declare a mix-in in a rule set and use it, use a mix-in call and a rule-set call as follows:

```css
Use mix-in and rule-set
@detached-ruleset: {
.mixin() {
color:blue;
@aa : red;
}
};
// Call Separated Rulesets
.caller {
@detached-ruleset();
.mixin();
}
```

```css
.caller {
color:blue;
}
```

And the variables defined inside the rule set are not returned. That is, it is a private area like a local variable.

```css
@detached-ruleset: {
@color:blue; // this variable is private
};
.caller {
Color: @color; // Grammar error
}
```

Scoping

Definition and Caller Scope Visibility

The separated rule set looks at the caller`s variable and mix-in. As follows:

```css
@detached-ruleset: {
caller-variable: @caller-variable; // variable not defined here
.caller-mixin(); // Mixin is not defined here
};

.selector {
// Using a Rule Set
@detached-ruleset();

// Define the required variables and mix-ins within the rule set
@caller-variable: value;
.caller-mixin() {
variable: declaration;
}
}
```

```css
.selector {
caller-variable: value;
variable: declaration;
}
```

The variables and mix-ins that are accessible from where they are defined attract what is available within the caller.

```css
// Global Variable
@variable: global;
@detached-ruleset: {
// The variables defined within the caller will be used.
content: '@{variable}';
};

.selector {
@detached-ruleset();
@variable: variable defined in caller; // region variable in caller
}
```

```css
.selector {
content: 'variable defined in caller';
}
```

Referring Won`t Modify Detected Ruleset Scope (References do not change the isolated ruleset scope)

The rule set is only referenced as follows and cannot access the new scope:

```css
@detached-1: {
scope-detached: @one @two;
};
.one {
@one: visible;
.two {
@detached-2: @detached-1; // Rename by copying the rule set
@two: visible;
}
}

.use-place {
@two : unreferenced;
.one > .two();
@detached-2();
}

```

```css
.use-place {
scope-detached: visible visible;
}
```
