Consider the things you should be aware of when upgrading your existing Windows system to Windows 10 or having clean installations in mind.

### Verify Hardware Compatibility

If Windows 10 is installed and the hardware that made up the existing system does not support it, it can be more difficult. In advance, let`s visit each hardware manufacturer`s website to find out what Windows 10 supports.

Download the driver from the manufacturer`s homepage.

Update BIOS/UEFI.

> In my case, I updated the UEFI on the main board, and after Windows 10 installation, I updated the driver.

Windows 10 runs on a variety of hardware, including low power systems, such as atom-based tablets, but with minimal requirements. If the computer is a processor with a speed of less than 1GHz, or has less than 1Gb of memory on a 32-bit system, or less than 2Gb of memory on a 64-bit system, the installer cannot complete the installation.

### Update duration and installation time

A one-year free update will take effect from 29 July 2015. If you make a reservation for a free upgrade of Windows 10, you will receive an upgrade notification sequentially, depending on the time difference.

If you want to upgrade to Windows 10 without a reservation, you can install it using the link below.

If the installation proceeds without errors, the installation can be completed within an hour. However, important updates of Windows do not always go smoothly, so backup of key data and ample time distribution are needed in preparation for the mishap. It is common for the sun to rise again after sunset to solve errors.

### Compatible programs and games

Program compatibility with Windows 10 continues to update, and Windows 10/compatible lists are available. Except for special cases, most programs and games are compatible.

There are several representative examples that prevent Windows from updating. One of them is the various utilities that Windows 8 and 8.1 install to restore the Sarizin Start menu, and similarly, programs that were deeply focused on the previous generation of Windows could cause Windows 10 upgrade failures.

### Microsoft Account Preparation

On Windows 8 and later operating systems, Microsoft accounts are set up to store connections between devices and system settings. By Windows 10, this account was used to build a more integrated system, including:

When you install Windows 10, you can create a Microsoft account, but you may need to verify it using a different device, such as authentication of your account, so let`s create it in advance.
