Primitive value

JavaScript can be divided into basic and reference types (objects).

The default typing is called raw data and refers to JavaScript values such as 5, `foo`, true, false, null, and undefined.

That is, five basic types: numeric, string, Boolean, null, and undefined, which are called primitives because this JavaScript value can no longer be simplified, and these values are referred to as these values are called primitives.

These values are inherently simple and cannot be expressed as composite values, which are values composed of several other values.

Very simply, the raw value is the simplest form of data and information available in JavaScript.

null, undefined, "string", 10, true, false means not an object requires no constructor function and no new operator to create a null, undefined value.

The remaining strings, numbers, and Boolean raw values are technically returned from the constructor function, but are not objects (this is not covered here).

### How are the raw values stored and copied?!

The raw value is stored and managed at face value.

This may be a simple word, but it also means that if the string "foo" is str, the value "foo" is literally stored in memory.

Why is this fact important?

The raw value is really "copy" so you should always remember this when you manipulate it (for example, copy).

Let`s find out with the following code.

As you can see from the code above, changing the value of the original variable does not change nameCopy because the value has already been copied.

If the above code is made up of reference type, the story will be different (see reference type).

Values stored and modified in raw values are values that can no longer be abbreviated; referring to raw values means that the values themselves are "copied, duplicated".

Let`s assume that this can happen in everyday life.

If you write a document and distribute it to someone else, you will copy it to distribute it.

The document you wrote is the original and the one you give out to the third party is a copy and a replica.

However, a third party can add or delete the contents of the shared copy to update it. Of course, you`ll use handwriting tools in your daily life, right? Underline it.

The above code is the same as the one in this situation.

Just because you copy and distribute the original copy and fix the original copy doesn`t change the copy you already distributed.

So even if you update the name value, the value of nameCopy is still maintaining the value when copying from name.

These properties contrast with composite objects (=reference type).

### The raw value compares the value itself.

When comparing raw data types, compare the values themselves to see if they are the same.

For example, when comparing a variable that stores a numeric value of 20 with another variable that has a numeric value of 20, JavaScript determines that the two variables are equal (20 === 20) because they have the same value of 20.

Of course, the same goes for variables that have strings attached.

The following code uses raw numeric values to compare the value itself with the case of a composite numeric object (reference type).

To summarize, raw values are not treated as raw values when comparing themselves, and when comparing strings, numbers, or Boolean values created by using the new keyword (e.g new String()).

Therefore, comparing values created using literal grammar with values created using the new keyword always shows that they are not the same.

This is because the raw value compares the low value, while the composite object (reference type) compares the stored reference (number of memory).

> A composite object is a composite of multiple values combined into one, distinct from the raw value in that it can be composed of multiple values.
