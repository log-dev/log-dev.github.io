Block elements that form the structure of a document

Learn about div, section, and article for structural markup elements in HTML5.

### Introduction to div, section, and article elements

- <div>: I already know it very well and it`s the most popular bowl of content. It no longer has any semantic meaning, it`s just a component that forms the flow of content.
- Section: A component that forms a section of a typical document or application, most of which is always used with heading elements (sometimes wrapped around heading elements with a header), and sometimes with a footer element. Think of it as a bundle of related content, such as long text details, or a bundle of pages in a web application that has an interface that requires the use of tab keys, such as the news section of a homepage.
- <article> : An independent part of a document or site. Even if this part is moved elsewhere, it should be separated and meaningful. Examples include articles on web blogs, posts on forums, or comments. Like the `section` element, you must have a heading element, and sometimes include the `header` element and the `footer` element.

If you read the definition of these three elements, they look quite similar. So we start by comparing and contrasting the <div> element.

### div element

In the writing of POSH1, we must use the most appropriate or semantic correct elements.

If the element implies that it is a usual vessel that forms a general flow of content, it means that it has no more semantic meaning.

In other words, it is used when there is no suitable element, and the content of `div` does not require a connection between each other within the page.

### section element

This new HTML5 `section` element is similar to the usual `div` element, but has some additional semantics.

In other words, the content that the `section` element contains must be a logically related aggregate.

The section is also a sectioning content element that divides sections.

Suppose you want to make a web page a list of nested related parts.

The heading of each sectioning content element forms a new item and allows the indentation to reflect the overlap level as shown below.

> 1. Example list item
2. Another item
1. A nested item
i. You get the idea!

The important thing to know here is that `div` is not a segmenting content element.

### article element

This new HTML5 `article` element is a type of specialized element, such as the `section` element.

It implies a more specific semantic meaning of being independent and self-reliant within the page.

We have a more semantic meaning on whether to use the `section` element or the `article` element.

### Which of these should I choose?

When you think about HTML4, these choices can be compared to those between > and Pre.

Both of these elements are flow content elements that hold text.

However, the <pre> element is a type of specialized <p> element that has a more specific meaning of blocking elements in preformatted text.

The same can be said for <section> and <article>.

While <article> refers to a piece of content that can be understood in itself, <section> refers to the content that is related.

There is something that may be confusing here. <section> can be used for parts and parts of a page.

You can also include multiple <articles> like the most recent part of your homepage, or you can also use the <section> element to divide sections within a long, long <article>.

It`s a confusing part.

For this reason, I would like to recommend you to take the following options to determine which of the elements is appropriate: article, section, or div

- Does the enclosed content make sense by itself? If so, use <article>
- Is the enclosed content related to the topic? If so, use <section>.
- If there is no semantic relevance, use <div>.

Occasionally, replace <div> with <section> and <article>, except as a means of connection to give style, and with other new structural elements that are more appropriate in HTML5.

However, if deemed appropriate, do not be afraid to use the <div> element. This is because the <div> element is still valid as HTML5.

<section> and <article> are being used as if <div> is being used in HTML4.

More specifically, these elements cannot be used in <blockquote> or <address>.

Overlapping of the <article> element in <article> should be avoided. Instead, you can use the section element to display logical parts of the article in £article.

Finally, in a web application, if le and £article do not contain a heading element.

It would be understandable if you think about the main list view page of the email application.

However, it would be better to add a heading element, even if the heading element is hidden with CSS.

Basic structure using the above elements

```undefined
<article>
<h1>Heading</h1>
<section>
<h2>Section Heading</h2>
<p>Content...</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Section Heading</h2>
<p>Content...</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Section Heading</h2>
<p>Content...</p>
</section>
</article>
```

The basic structure above is surrounded by the <article> element, and the details are clearly grouped into the <section> element.

If you want, you can cover it with sequential list elements.
