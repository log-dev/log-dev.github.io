integrity, crossorigin

The folks over at MaxCDN graciously provide CDN support for Bootstrap`s CSS and JavaScript. Just use these Bootstrap CDN links.

The bootstrap CDN has the following `intergrity` and `crossorigin` attributes:

```undefined
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha512-dTfge/zgoMYpP7QbHy4gWMEGsbsdZeCXz7irItjcC3sPUFtf0kuFbDz/ixG7ArTxmDjLXDmezHubeNiky

<!-- Optional theme -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" integrity="sha384-aUGj/X2zp5rLCbBxumKTCw2Z50WgIr1vs/PFN4praOTvYXWlVyh2UtNUU0KAUhAX" crossorigin="anonym

<!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->

```

The reason for this attribute is security.

Intergrity is a security-related attribute that was detailed in the pill blog and extracted.

### DDoS attack based on JavaScript

DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service, an advanced form of DoS attack.

DDoS attacks differ the most from DOS attacks in the number of attackers.

A DoS attack involves one client making numerous attempts to connect to a particular server, and a DDoS attack involves multiple clients trying to connect to a particular server from one to tens of thousands of times.

With the development of defense technologies and equipment for DDoS attacks, DDoS attacks are evolving as well.

While early DDoS attacks used malware-infected zombie PCs (botnets), methods such as amplification attacks using NTP, SNMP, DNS, etc. have recently become increasingly intelligent and advanced.

The DDoS attacks GitHub has also been identified as DDoS attacks using Javascript.

DDoS attack principle using JavaScript

Many homepages use Javascript with HTML or use html tags such as `<script src=">` to remotely load Javascript files from the server for various functional implementations and convenience. Web 2.0 allows content within JavaScript to be loaded asynchronously. Web2.0 values interaction with users, so when users create new content, it is designed not only to synchronize to the web server in real time, but also to communicate with other users on the same homepage. You can even share information among other websites.

HTTP(S) requests produced in Javascript are designed to allow browsers to implement more features. However, on the other hand, attacks using these characteristics can lead to web browsers being the perpetrators of cyberattacks. The browser is defaulted to turn on JavaScript, so it will run automatically in your browser if the user does not turn off the JavaScript execution feature. If a user accesses a web page containing JavaScript as shown below, he or she will unknowingly access the web page specified in the script.

```js
 function imgflood() {
var TARGET = 'victim-website.com'
var URI = '/index.php?'
var pic = new Image()
var rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)
pic.src = 'http://'+TARGET+URI+rand+'=val'
}
setInterval(imgflood, 10)
```

The script creates an image click button on the web page that you want to attack, and when you click the image, it sends a request to the `victim-website.com` page. If a user visits a page that contains the script, it`s like being one of the people doing a DDoS attack on page `victim-website.com`.

If an attacker uploads malicious Javascript to a web page, users visiting that web page become one DDoS attacker, which does not require a large amount of zombie PCs, such as other DDoS attacks.

Servers that share vulnerable JavaScript

Most web pages typically have JavaScript DBs. This saves traffic and saves it on other servers, such as IDC, for example, for performance improvements. That is, if a web page contains third-party server script annotations, users automatically access the web page and automatically download and run JavaScript. If JavaScript contains a DDoS attack code, the visitor is one of the DDoS attacks.

### Subresource Integrity

As described above, attacks using JavaScript on other servers are a bit outdated.

Currently, HTTP does not have any mechanisms to restrict the execution of scripts.

However, W3C has added a new feature to control script execution called SRI.

This proves the script with a hash value and does not run if the hash value does not match the browser value.

For example, a script is shown below.

```undefined
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
```

In this case, the browser automatically downloads the corresponding .js file and runs it immediately without determining if the file is malicious.

The browser also cannot determine whether the file is malicious or not.

However, if the hash value of the web page does not match the hash value of the script, the SRI sends the command to the browser to disable the script.

```undefined
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js
integrity="sha256-C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh/E1uhG5Twh+Y5qFQmYg=" crossorigin="anonymous""></script>
```

The homepage administrator can register the following comments on the server to prevent users from being used in malicious attacks:

Currently, browsers that support SRI include Chrome, Firefox, and Swing.

This intermediary attack approach allows you to replace JavaScript scripts with malicious scripts containing DDoS attack scripts. However, this attack is limited in that packets must pass through the network to which the attacker belongs.

These attacks can be prevented through encrypted HTTPS communication.
