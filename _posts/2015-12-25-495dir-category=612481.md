Let`s take a look at how to extract thumbnail using SoundCloud`s open API. In this article, we used JavaScript, which is easier to access if you use a server script.

### Issue SoundCloud API Key

API Key issuance is required to extract sound cloud thumbnail. You can access the SoundCloud API and get a key issued for the application you want to use. In this article, JavaScript is used to select Client-side JavaScript Applications. Of course, let`s sign up for SoundCloud in advance.

> In the meantime, other multimedia services have sought alternative measures without issuing keys, but soundcloud has not found a way.

Click the Try out the Client-side auth flow button to connect to the account and create and save the application with the appropriate name. Try to remember the Client ID at this time. Your application can then be found in Your Applications.

### Extract SoundCloud VID

Suppose a soundcloud player has been inserted somewhere as shown below. Most multimedia services require extraction of these VID values to separate images with their own ID values (VIDs) and classify each information, but the soundcloud proceeds to extract all of the values before the VIDs because they are reusable.

```html
<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/41340102
```

Among the inserted multimedia source codes (iframes), it filters out regular expressions based on the special strings that soundcloud players have.

```js
var vurl = $('iframe').attr('src').match(/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/?([0-9]+)/i);

```

### Request json data via Ajax

We use extracted vurl values and issued Client IDs to access json data, an API provided by SoundCloud, through Ajax.

```js
var ajaxUrl = 'http://'+vurl+'.json?client_id=발급받은 Client ID;
$.ajax({
url: ajaxUrl,
dataType: "json"
})

```

If you look at the json data provided by SoundCloud, you can see `artwork_url:Thumbnail Address` related to thumbnail.

```json
[{
...
"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000020735170-gj7x4i-large.jpg"
...
}]

```

If you look at thumbnail url from json data that was checked above, you can see `large` and the size of thumbnail changes based on this keyword. The size of the thumbnail that can be changed is as follows.

```js
$.ajax({
url: ajaxUrl,
dataType: "json"

}).done(function (data) {
var thumb = "Specify the desired thumbnail size";
var vsrc = data.artwork_url.replace('large', thumb);
$('.thumbnail').append('<img src="'+vsrc+'">');

}).fail(function (data) {
alert('SoundCloud Thumbnail extraction failed!');
});

```

### SoundCloud API

SoundCloud provides an API that provides various information needed to create applications. To use SoundCloud for Developers, you must register your soundcloud account and application and issue a key.
