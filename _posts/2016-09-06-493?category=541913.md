Mobile Web

The web page that you usually search for on your smartphone is the typical mobile web.

The mobile web is a mobile screen size representation of the functionality of the desktop browser, such as the font, image, and touch icon of the site for the PC.

For this reason, the mobile web usually has a simpler UI (User Interface) than a regular PC web page.

The mobile web browsers run on mobile web technology for development pool has a slow connection speeds over the way pages and browsing app to the downside.I have.

Some of the technologies used on the mobile web include:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- jQuery Mobile, Sencha Touch
- PhoneGap, Titanium, Ionic, Rramework7, OnsenUI, 구글의 Material Design

Web browsers optimized for mobile environments are representative of IOS-equipped mobile safari and Android`s default browsers.

In addition, you can select and use various web browsers, including Opera Mini Browser and Firefox Mobile Browser, which are compatible with each mobile platform.

### Different resolutions by device

The most important thing for HTML markup for the mobile web is resolution.

Typically, PC-based web pages were designed and marked up to optimize for fixed resolutions such as 1024*768, 1280*1024.

However, mobile devices have different resolutions, such as 320*480, 640*960, 480*800, and 1024*600, so you need to consider more different resolutions when developing the mobile web.

And although the resolution is Dal|, the size of the liquid crystal is mostly similar.

This means that when produced in the same size, the web page looks relatively small on mobile devices with high liquid crystal size and high resolution.

Therefore, it is recommended to test the mobile web on a web browser based on Google Chrome Webkit as possible. In addition, it is recommended that you create web pages in percentage rather than pixel (px) design on mobile.

There are two main ways to respond to various resolutions.

One is to fit the site to size using CSS3 media query, and the other is to fit the site to the width of your mobile device.

The way to fit a site to the width of a mobile device is to set the viewport property in the `<meta>` tag in HTML.

### Viewport

The concept of viewport itself is not limited to the mobile web.

To roughly define a viewport, it is an area where display elements are represented on a device, such as a computer or mobile device.

For the mobile web, it can be interpreted as the area where the web page is displayed in the iPhone Safari browser.

Then why has Viewport become important on the mobile web?!

This is attributed to the ability of the mobile web to browse web pages.

Currently, smartphone browsers support full-browsing.

Full-browsing refers to an environment where you can browse the entire web screen naturally, just like a desktop environment.

When you try to display all the web pages on a mobile device on a small screen, the overall page scaling (ratio) is applied.

This means that the entire screen is reduced to fit, so that all of the screens are browsed, but the content on the page is significantly less readable.

Webkit-based browsers have a viewport default width of 980 pixels. However, the width of the iPhone safari browser is 320 pixels wide.

This means that the overall scale (ratio) is reduced so that the 980-sized pages can be seen on the 320-screen.

Viewport Metatags allow you to adjust the size and scale of your mobile browser`s viewport, allowing you to set the screen to display optimally on the mobile web.

Set `veiwport` inside the head of the html document corresponding to the mobile browser.

Viewports can be set up differently depending on your browser and resolution.All

Desktop/Mobile Viewport

The desktop becomes a view port in the area shown on the screen, but the mobile becomes a view port in the size of the document.

If the view port has a physical width of 320px, 320px of the web document will be placed into the view port.

The iPhone 4+ Retina display has a 640px wide view port, but only 320px of a web document (because 1px of a web document is displayed as 4px on a retina device).

### viewport properties of meta tags

```undefined
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, ...">
```

width

- Set the width of your mobile device
- Setting the value to device-width makes it visible according to the width of the mobile device.
- It can be specified by using px, 980px by default, 200px by default, and up to 10,000px by default.
- When set to device-width, it is based on the screen size of the device.

initial-sacle

- The default rate at which the page is viewed (means the magnification of the screen)
- 1 is the horizontal resolution of mobile devices.
- Scales from 0 to 10 can be adjusted.

maximum-scale

- The maximum percentage of pages visible.
- That is, the magnifying rate at which the user zooms in.

minimum-scale

- The minimum percentage of pages visible.
- This means the decreasing scale of the user zooming out; the default is 0.25

user-scalable

- Defines whether the page can be zoomed in or out.

See Other Site Viewports

Please refer to the viewport tags you have set up for the mobile web site in the domestic portal and other sites.

m.naver.com

```undefined
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0">
```

m.daum.net

```undefined
<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
```

m.nate.com

```undefined
<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
```

m.yahoo.com

```undefined
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"/>
```

The viewports of the above major sites are almost identical, and many viewports are usually set with this configuration.

The viewport above specifies the width of the device, does not allow it to be zoomed in/out by the user, and the initial scale is 1.0, or zoomless, as it is.

### Mobile Web Production Foundation

Assuming that you understand HTML markup and CSS, let`s look at the basic ways to create the mobile web.

HTML Markup Method for Mobile Web

To start with the conclusion, there is no special way to mark up HTML standard on the mobile web.

This is because it is not much different from the way HTML markups are based on web standards.

However, UI/UX for the mobile web and tags optimized for the mobile web should be considered.

Setting text size for the mobile web

In mobile, font units should use attributes that represent relative sizes affected by the size of parent elements such as px, em, ex, and % rather than attributes that represent absolute sizes such as pt, in, etc.

Considering the various resolutions and the size of the liquid crystal on the device, it is better in terms of accessibility and usability to produce text sizes in relative, fluid sizes rather than absolute sizes.

Relative units (px, em, ex, % and rem)

- It is fixed to the browser based on px : pixel, but has a relative size depending on the display (the device`s resolution of the device). (1px = 1dot)
- em: The value is based on the width of the capital M of the font.
- ex : x-height. The value is based on the height of the lowercase letter x of the corresponding font.
- % : percent. relative to the size of the basic font.
- rem : root em. relative to the size of the top element.

To calculate font size

The default value of the browser is 1em = 16px, so if you want to use 12px, the em calculation method will be 12 (which you want to use) / 16 (base size px) = 0.75em.

Conversion to % would result in 12 (px you want to use) / 16 (base size px) * 100 = 75%.

### Mobile Web Shortcuts icon

On smartphones or tablets, by default, you can bookmark a mobile web page and place it on your home screen as an app icon.

It`s about convenience so that you can see the web page you want right away.

Just as conventional PC-based webs produce a shortcut (favorite) icon called Pavicon, smartphones and tablets often produce icons separately because they have a higher resolution.

The following is about the Pavicon settings used on the PC Web:

```undefined
<!doctype html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>PC Web Pavicon Settings</title>
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="http://webclub.tistory.com/images/favicon.ico" />
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

Fabicon size is 16*16.

The icon file is saved in PNG format and can be set to the following sizes:

```undefined
<!doctype html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Set mobile web and app icons</title>

<!-- iPhone only tags -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="app_icon.png">

<!-- Tags available for both Android and iPhone -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" href="app_icon.png">

</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

It is inconvenient and wasteful to make icon sizes by device, so it is recommended to make them 120*120 size considering `iOS7+` or higher.

Generally, the size and production of icon images are up to the designer, so I don`t think you need to know more.

### Setting text size for the mobile web

The mobile environment is available on a small screen, so avoid text that is too small and make sure it looks the right size.

Therefore, in the mobile environment, which is changing to landscape mode and portrait mode, users are uncomfortable when the font becomes too big or too small, so text augmentation prevention tags are released in response.

For example, a mobile safari browser can automatically resize or size text text to match the attribute value that determines the horizontal of the text area.

That is, iPhone automatically adjusts font size when viewport changes.

It is text-size-adjus that prevents this.

The property used to do this is `-webkit-text-size-adjust`.

```css
html {
-webkit-text-size-adjust: none;
}
```

- `auto`: Size text automatically to match width of screen.
Automatic adjustment is not a recommended method because if the device is rendered differently, it is rendered differently.
- `none`: It automatically converts font size so that users don`t feel uncomfortable.
This method is commonly used to avoid automatically resizing text.
- `%` : It explicitly designates font size.
This method is often used in some cases.
It is a method that explicitly gives 100% to show the same across all devices.
