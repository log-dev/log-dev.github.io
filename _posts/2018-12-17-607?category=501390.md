Throttle, Debounce

What are Throttle and Devounce?

Both methods control (restrict) the quantitative aspects of JS, i.e. events, for performance reasons, JavaScript that runs based on DOM events.

For example, suppose a web/app user drags a scroll wheel, trackpad, and scrollbar.
Dragging the scroll wheel, trackpad, and scrollbar may not make the user feel great, but this action results in numerous scroll events.
In other words, if the user scrolls down by 5000 pixels, there is a high possibility that more than 100 events will occur.
By dragging these scroll wheels, track pads, and scroll bars, you`ll get a callback to each scroll event, and what that callback does will eat up a very large resource.
In other words, excessive execution of events will cause performance problems if the event handler performs numerous tasks such as heavy calculations and other DOM operations, which will even reduce the user experience.

The following example is similar to the situation described above.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="403" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/PXzOzV?height=403&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=PXzOzV&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=Scroll%20events%20counter&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="Scroll events counter" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_PXzOzV"></iframe>

This issue occurred in 2011 when scrolling through Twitter on the Twitter website, slowing down and unresponsive.
John Resig, the founder of jQuery, posted a blog post about how bad it is to attach expensive features directly to a scroll event.

At that time, John Lessik`s proposed solution was a loop that ran 250 ms every hour outside the onScroll event, which would prevent excessive event processing. With this simple technology, I was able to avoid ruining the user experience.

These days, the solution is Throttle, Debounce, which is more sophisticated than at that time.
Throttle and Debounce are techniques that aim to cause events to occur (and escape if the handler runs less) at a controllable level if the event handler performs many operations (e.g., heavy calculations and other DOM operations).

Throttle and Debounce use cases

- Wait for the user to stop resizing the window before using the resizing event.
- To avoid generating ajax event until the user stops typing the keyboard (for example, in the search window)
- You want to measure the scroll position of the page and respond every 50 ms maximum.
- To ensure good performance when dragging elements from an app

Debounce and throttle are similar techniques that control how many times a function is executed over time, but they are different.

Deviance or throttle is especially useful when attaching a function to a DOM event.
This is because it provides a control layer between events and function execution. And remember, we don`t control how often DOM events are sent out.

Let`s look at the technology and its differences.

### Debounce

`Debounce` is a technology that groups events so that only one event occurs after a certain time.
This means that sequential calls can be "grouped" into one group.

Imagine that you are in the elevator. If the door starts to close and someone tries to get on suddenly, the elevator does not start moving to the floor and the door opens again. And the floor movement change function is caused by another person. This means that the elevator is slowing down (moving between floors) but optimizing resources.

Click the button or move it over the mouse to see an example of a debounce.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="438" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/XoKeRW?height=438&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=XoKeRW&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=Debounce.%20Trailing&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="Debounce. Trailing" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_XoKeRW"></iframe>

In the example above, you can see how successive quick events are represented as a single debouncing event.

However, debouncing does not occur when events occur at large intervals.

Size Example (Resize Sample)

When you resize a browser window on your desktop, you can export many windowed events.

The following is a demonstration of browser window adjustment.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="360" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/GPqOaK?height=360&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=GPqOaK&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=Debounce%20Resize%20Event%20Example&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="Debounce Resize Event Example" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_GPqOaK"></iframe>

As you can see, we`re tracking the end of the resize event.
Because we are only interested in the final value that the user did not adjust the browser size.

Example of pressing a key on an autocomplete form with an Ajax request

These days, the results come out right away without an enter as soon as the search term is searched.
Let`s say you type `Zerocho` in the search box. You must always be waiting for an input event to show results immediately without an enter.
The problem is that ajax request is executed every single letter. `£`, `Ze`, `Zel`, `Zero`, `Zero` and `Zerocho` are all executed.
I have requested 6 times (a combination language like Korean may have more events than 6 times as shown in the picture). In addition, `£`, `Zel`, and `Zerot` are search words that do not seem to have proper search results.

This waste is a big problem when using paid APIs.
If Google Maps uses API or something like this 10 times, it will be a huge loss.
One query is all about money. Therefore, debouncing is also related to cost issues. Therefore, you will have to send ajax request when you hurt the last `Zerocho`.

The following are similar examples:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/JwKMGw?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=JwKMGw&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=Debouncing%20keystrokes%20Example&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="Debouncing keystrokes Example" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_JwKMGw"></iframe>

### Throttle

`Throttle` is a technology that allows events to occur at regular intervals.
For example, if you give 1 ms as the set time of Throttle, that event will only occur once for 1 ms.

The characteristics themselves limit the number of runs, so they are commonly used due to performance problems.
When scrolling up or down, it is very common for scroll event handlers.
If you set up something complicated to do when a scroll event occurs, it might take a lot of buffering because it runs very frequently.
In that case, thrashing can be used. You`re limiting it to run once every few seconds, or only once every few milliseconds.

Infinite scrolling page

If you need to check how far away from the footer and you have scrolled to the bottom, you need to request more content through Ajax and add it to the page.

Devailing only causes events when the user stops scrolling, so throttle may be more appropriate than debouncing. This is because the user must import the content before reaching the footer
Throttle always lets you see how far away your location is from the footer.
