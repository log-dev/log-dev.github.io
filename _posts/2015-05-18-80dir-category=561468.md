### IE7-js Introduction

Dean Edward`s eye7-js is a JavaScript library that allows older versions of IE to recognize HTML5 tags as well as some CSS3 selectors. It also addresses issues below IE6 that do not support the transparent effect of PNG.

- css selectors such as child selectors, neighbor selectors, structure selectors, property selectors, etc.
- css properties including max-width, min-height
- File transparency in png picture files
- Related bug fixes for common bugs such as double margin bugs and kkakkung nori bugs.

It is currently updated to provide up to ie9.js.Check the Demo to see what each version supports.

### IE7-js Usage

Use CDN as shown below or download the code directly from the homepage and connect it. The version continues to rise, and is now the latest version of ie9.js and does not have to include subversions.

```html
<!--[if lt IE 7]>
<script src="http://ie7-js.googlecode.com/svn/version/2.1(beta4)/IE7.js"></script>
<![endif]-->

```

```html
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
<script src="http://ie7-js.googlecode.com/svn/version/2.1(beta4)/IE8.js"></script>
<![endif]-->

```

```html
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="http://ie7-js.googlecode.com/svn/version/2.1(beta4)/IE9.js"></script>
<![endif]-->

```

### IE6 Troubleshooting PNG Transparency

ie7.js also addresses errors in IE6 that grey out the transparent portion of the PNG file. Transparent effect is applied only to files whose file name is `file name-trans.png`.

If you want it to be applied to all PNG files, you can set the global variable as shown below and declare it before inserting ie7.js.

```js
var IE7_PNG_SUFFIX = ".png";

```

Another method is to declare inside the inserted eye7.js syntax.

```html
<script src="IE7.js">IE7_PNG_SUFFIX=".png";</script>

```

By default, PNG extends (stetched). If you want to turn this off, you can set the `no-repeat` attribute as shown below.

```css
div.example {
background: url(my-trans.png) no-repeat;
}

```

Unfortunately, in ie7.js, transparent background images cannot be used as `background-repet` and cannot be positioned using `background-position`.
