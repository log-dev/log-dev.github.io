We looked at the structure of index.html on the boiler plate and added a commentary on it. I`ve already replaced the previously mentioned parts with links.

The content described below is based on Download v5.2.0. The contents may vary by version, so let`s keep that in mind.

```html

function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;
e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];

```

### #1 Document Type Declaration

```html
<!doctype html>

```

It tells you which version of the markup language the document to be processed by the browser is written in. The document format determines whether HTML documents are rendered in Standard mode or Quirks mode.

- If DOCTYPE is not declared, it will be rendered in non-standard mode.
- DOCTYPE should be at the top of the HTML document.
- DOCTYPE is designed for validation, not for browsers.
- Because browsers do not support document formats, but functionality, the latest document formats are also allowed in older browsers. If you read this DOCTYPE, the content will be put into standard mode even in browsers where HTML5 is not implemented properly. Therefore, it is not completed yet, but even if you write a web page with HTML5 right now, you don`t have to worry about future compatibility problems.
- In the past, this phrase was written in capital letters, but it is now written in lowercase letters. It seems to be a movement to unify into an environment that does not affect or affect anything, but is not case-sensitive.
- For more information, see the link below:

### #2 Human Language and Modernizer

```html
<html class="no-js" lang="">

```

As soon as HTML documents are started, they are adding human language and modernizer class `no-js`.

- If JavaScript is allowed in the browser, the class value is changed to `js`. This is a function of Modernizr. If you do not use Modernizr, you can use `<noscript>` to prompt users who do not support JavaScript to activate it, or link other files.
- Human language refers to the language of contents written, and although the value is empty, it can be added like `ko` or `en`.

### #3 Specify Character Set

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">

```

Declares what the character encoding used in the document is.

- The recommended encoding of web documents is utf-8.
- The character set shall be located within the first 1024 bytes of the page. This is because some browsers navigate within the first 1024 bytes when searching for a character set on a web page.
- Character sets should be declared prior to the element <title>.
- If a character set is not specified, IE often uses incorrect encoding UTF-7, which causes problems.
- For more information, see the link below:
charset properties
Character Set UTF-8 and EUC-KR
- charset properties
- Character Set UTF-8 and EUC-KR

### #4 Specify IE rendering mode

```html
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">

```

When access to the document into a browser ie ie is should select the rendering engine operation.

- `ie=edge` is always rendered using the latest standard engine.
- Previously, it was recommended to install ActiveX called Chrome Frame as an alternative method such as `content="ie=edge,chrome=1" but is no longer recommended as a development end of Chrome Frame.
- For more information, see the link below:
X-UA-Compatible, IE=edge, Compatibility View
- X-UA-Compatible, IE=edge, Compatibility View

### #5 Introduction to the title and content of the document

```html
<title></title>
<meta name="description" content="">

```

The title of the document is closely related to search engine optimization (SEO).

- Title should be declared as soon as possible to prevent security issues associated with encoding IE browsers.
- Write the appropriate title of the document in the title tag.
- The description meta-tag outlines the content of the content that the document contains.
- The search engine compares the search results with the search words based on the title of the document, the contents of the Meta tag, and the first 100-150 characters of the text.
- For more information, see the link below:
Name property of META element
- Name property of META element

### #6 Mobile Viewport Settings

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

```

It controls the screen size of various devices such as mobile and tab.

- `width=device-width` is sized to fit the width of a device. If web documents are flexible desktop designs, it is better to use these attributes and attribute values on mobile devices. Also, a fixed desktop design is not a problem, and a mobile design is nothing more.
- `Intial-scale=1` sets the default size scale. In mobile browsers, zoom is used a lot, and the attribute value is fixed at 1 if it needs to be avoided for optimal use environments.
- The following values can be used as property values for content.
`user-scalable=no` : Allow user to zoom in (yes/no)
`Intial-scale=1.0` : Expansion ratio when loading pages
`maximum-scale=1.0`: Maximum expansion rate
`minimum-scale=1.0` : Minimum reduction consumption rate
`width=device-width` : fits the horizontal size of the platform and fits the figure if you put the figure.
`target-densitydpi=medium-dpi` : dpi([dots per inch])
- `user-scalable=no` : Allow user to zoom in (yes/no)
- `Intial-scale=1.0` : Expansion ratio when loading pages
- `maximum-scale=1.0`: Maximum expansion rate
- `minimum-scale=1.0` : Minimum reduction consumption rate
- `width=device-width` : fits the horizontal size of the platform and fits the figure if you put the figure.
- `target-densitydpi=medium-dpi` : dpi([dots per inch])

### #7 Register Apple Touch Icon and Fabicon

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="apple-touch-icon.png">
<!-- Place favicon.ico in the root directory -->

```

Touch icons can be specified on iOS 2.0 and Android 2.1 and later.

- If only one touch icon (152x152) is prepared, the size of the icon changes at low resolution. However, adding an icon to the device`s home screen can negatively affect performance.
- The Pavicon can be placed in the root directory.
- For more information, see the link below:

### #8 Insert Style Sheet

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">

```

Insert the Normalize.css file for CSS initialization and the main.css file responsible for the style of the page.

- Normalize.css is a CSS initialization file that helps unify elements with different styles in different browsers.
- main.css is a file that creates the style of documents with the helper classes provided by the boilerplate.
- For more information, see the link below:
Normalize.css - Initialize CSS
- Normalize.css - Initialize CSS

### #9 Insert Modernizer Script

```html
<script src="js/vendor/modernizr-2.8.3.min.js"></script>

```

Modernizer is a JavaScript library for HTML5 and CSS3 functionality verification.

- Modernizers provided by boiler plates include `html5shiv`. html5shiv is located in "head", unlike other JavaScript, because it must be inserted after a style sheet.
- For more information, see the link below:

### #10 Browser Upgrade Notification

```html
<!--[if lt IE 8]>
<p class="browserupgrade">You are using an <strong>outdated</strong> browser. Please <a href="http://browsehappy.com/">upgrade your browser</a> to improve your experience.</p>
<![endif]-->

```

An older IE browser below IE8 will be notified to upgrade the browser.

- Conditional annotations only work up to IE9.
- You can use it by modifying it in appropriate Korean, and you can choose a variety of browsers if you access it through a link.
- For more information, see the link below:

### #11 Google CDN and jQuery

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/vendor/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"><\/script>')</script>

```

Add it using Google CDN for jQuery users and prepare local files in case CDN is not available.

- Why use CDNs for common JavaScript libraries such as jQuery:
Reduced delay - CDN distributes static files across multiple physical servers, allowing them to be downloaded from the nearest network upon request.
Parallel growth - To avoid unnecessary server loads, web browsers limit the number of connections that can be connected simultaneously. It depends on the browser, but it is about two per host name. CDN reduces one request to the site, allowing it to be downloaded in parallel.
Improved caching - potentially the best benefit is that users may not receive downloads. You don`t have to receive it if you got it from another site.

- If Google CDN cannot be imported, it will import a local file. When testing locally (just an HTML file, not a local server), open a local HTML file in a browser, file://C:/Users/lainfox/... As such, jQuery cannot be loaded because the protocol in the URL becomes a file and is intended to be recalled in the form of file://ajax.googleapis.com/...

### #12 Insert Additional Scripts

```html
<script src="js/plugins.js"></script>
<script src="js/main.js"></script>

```

Plugins.js includes jQuery plugins and other third party scripts.

- plugins.js is for maintenance of the site`s plug-in code. Rather than using multiple file links, including them in one file can help improve performance. For documents that must contain very large plugin files that are not exceptionally visited, it is recommended that the plug-in be disconnected and used only when accessing the target page. In most cases, however, it is easily available simply by pasting a compressed version of the plugin.
- Plugins.js includes a top-level method for avoiding console logs in web browsers (IE6/7) that do not have console output capabilities.
- Write the main JavaScript in main.js.

### #13 Google Analytics Tracking Code

```html
<!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. -->
<script>
(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
function(){(b[l].q=b[l].q||[]).push(arguments)});b[l].l=+new Date;
e=o.createElement(i);r=o.getElementsByTagName(i)[0];
e.src='https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js';
r.parentNode.insertBefore(e,r)}(window,document,'script','ga'));
ga('create','UA-XXXXX-X','auto');ga('send','pageview');
</script>

```

It uses an optimized version of the Google Universal Analytics tracking tool.

- In the UA-XXXXX-X section, enter the ID issued by Google Analytics.
- Google recommends placing this code between <head> and </head> for accurate aggregation. It is necessary for accurate aggregation of the users, but it is ahead of the loading of the contents, which increases the loading time that the users feel. For that reason, the code is located right in front of </body>.
- Although included as the most general-purpose tool, alternative measures may be used for different purposes.
