Prototype, constructor, instance

This article will learn about the prototype properties of the instance and the constructor properties of the prototype object.

### constructor, prototype object, instance relationship diagram

Function Model

Typically, when you define all functions, the following models are constructed:

```js
function fn() {
var x = 10;
var y = 20;
return x + y;
}
fn();

```

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/214AB44B574B9E0823)

The figure above shows that when a function is defined, an object called a prototype associated with that function is defined together.

The constructor is also constructed in the same structure as this as a function.

Constructor Model

Now view the constructor person defined as follows:

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}
```

When you parse and define a person, the constructor object and the prototype object are finally defined together.

This does not mean that the two beings are included in the same object.

The constructor and prototype objects exist separately, as shown in the following figure, and are linked with references to each other.

And the public variable scope is where the constructor`s members are defined, and since there are no constructor members in the current person, the plot can be simplified as follows:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/22720D4E574BA37A31)

The constructor and its prototype object are represented separately to emphasize that the person constructor and its prototype object are separate objects.

The two isolated objects are associated with the constructor of the prototype object and the prototype property of the constructor.

When constructor objects and prototype objects are created, the `prototype` and `constructor` public properties are added and references to each other are assigned.

Now create an object with `new person`.

```js
// Create Person Instance
var mySon = new Person('jaehee');
```

When you draw the relationship between prototype, constructor and the instance that is created after this code is executed:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/256C6B4C574BA6B814)

The picture shows that mySon instance inherits a prototype member of Person.

Thus, constructor objects, prototype objects, and instances should be separated.

A constructor, a prototype object, is an object that is defined together when a function is defined, and an instance is an object that is obtained by creating it.

### Prototype Object

Learn more about prototype objects that are said to be defined together when you define a function.

Prototype Properties

The example code above, the Person constructor, has a public property called prototype, which allows you to access prototype objects.

```js
Person.prototype
```

You must use the prototype property of the constructor to access and add or delete members of the constructor`s prototype object.

Because only one prototype object is defined per constructor, the constructor is being used to access the prototype object.

However, there is no way to access prototype objects directly from an instance.

Therefore, the following code is not valid:

```js
'mySon.prototype // invalid code'
```

Importantly, even though you do not have direct access to prototype objects, you can access prototype members defined by their constructors through instances.

Characteristics of Prototype Objects

The prototype object is also a JavaScript object.

In other words, a prototype object is also an associated array structure that allows you to add (key, value) paired members.

This allows you to dynamically add members at runtime to prototype objects.

For your information, a member included in a prototype object is called a prototype member, and when a prototype object is created, a property called constructor is added by default.

The following code adds a prototype method member of the person via prototype:

```js
Person.prototype.getName = function () {
return this.name;
}

```

If you add it through Person.prototype, the member will be available to all instances of Person.

In other words, every instance inherits a member of a prototype object that the constructor has.

All Person instances now have access to getName.

The code for the Person constructor is as follows:

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.getName = function () {
return this.name;
}

var mySon = new Person('jaehee');
var yourSon = new Person('jeongin');

console.log(mySon.getName()); // jaehee 반환
console.log(yourSon.getName()); // jeongin 반환
```

If `this` is used in a prototype member as shown above, this `this` indicates the current instance.

As you can see from the code above, you can access getName through the prototype of the constructor, such as `Person.prototype.getName`, and you can access it through an instance like `mySon.getName`.

However, you can do different things depending on whether you access through the prototype of the constructor or through the instance.

We will look into the explanation behind you.

Compare prototype members to instance members

Each instance is also an associated array structure, so you can add members dynamically.

Try adding members to the previously created instance, mySon, yourSon.

```js
'mySon.nickName = 'Jaehee Nickname';
Your Son.nickName = 'Jeongjin Nickname';'
```

As shown above, newly added nickName members in an instance are managed on a per-instance basis.

JavaScript has released the members of the object for manipulation at any time.

Therefore, members of a prototype object can add, remove, and replace members at any time.

A prototype object is created only once when you define a function in memory.

A prototype member does not have a copy suit per instance, but only one exists in that constructor and all instances of that constructor are shared together.

Asymmetry in Edit Prototype Member

If you don`t understand the characteristics of the prototype members described here, you can spend a lot of time writing JavaScript code and debugging it.

It`s clear in structure because there are parts that may not work out as we intended.

First, let`s take the following code as an example.

```js
// Define constructor
function Person() {
}

// Create Instance
var mySon = new Person();
var yourSon = new Person();

// Write the page value via prototype
Person.prototype.age = 6;
```

The constructor person was defined above and created the person instance, mySon, yourSon.

Then we added the attribute "age" to the person`s prototype object.

Read prototype members

When a prototype member is read as follows, the results are obvious as follows:

```js
Read `//age value
console.log(Person.prototype.age); // 6 출력
console.log(mySon.age); // 6 출력
console.log(yourSon.age); // 6 출력
```

MySon, yourSon doesn`t have an age.

As a result, objects move on to the prototype after completing his search properties from myson age age to retrieve the same value because search results and outputs, 6.Output.

When you "read" the value of a member defined in a Person prototype object (in this case the page), you can use both of the following expressions:

```js
var age = Person.prototype.age;
var age = mySon.age;
```

adding prototype members

Now let`s see the code that writes the value to the page through the instance as follows:

```js
Write 7 in mySon.age = 7; // in mySon.
Write 8 in yourSon.age = 8; // in yourSon.
```

The edge is not an instance member, so mySon cannot find the edge.

Then, should I add the age as a property to mySon instance or search for members of a prototype object?

To find out, print out the values you assigned earlier as follows:

```js
// Define constructor
function Person() {
}

// Create Instance
var mySon = new Person();
var yourSon = new Person();

// Write the page value via prototype
Person.prototype.age = 6;


write 7 in mySon.age = 7; // in mySon.
Write 8 in yourSon.age = 8; // in yourSon.

// Read the page value
console.log(Person.prototype.age); // 6 출력
console.log(mySon.age); // 7 출력
console.log(yourSon.age);// 8 출력
```

The output results show that when you write values to properties through an instance, you search for properties only on instances, not on prototype objects.

That is, assigning a value to mySon.age does not update the value of `Person.prototype.age`, but rather by adding the edge attribute to mySon.

Now, as in code, if you output the value of the page through an instance, you will output the value of the page for each instance.

The reason for this mechanism is that multiple instances will be created using one constructor to prevent modifying values in one instance from affecting other objects.

However, in some situations, you may want to modify the values of all instances at the same time, what should you do?

You can use the prototype of the constructor to directly access the prototype object and change the value instead of accessing it through the instance as follows:

If you change the value of the property via prototype as shown below, the same value is now output when you read the page value through all instances.

```js
function Person() {
}

// Create Instance
var mySon = new Person();
var yourSon = new Person();

// Write the page value via prototype
Person.prototype.age = 10;

// Read the page value
console.log(Person.prototype.age); // 10 출력
console.log(mySon.age); // 10 출력
console.log(yourSon.age);// 10 출력
```

### constructor

When you define a function, you describe that the prototype object is defined and has a `constructor` property as a member of that object.

The constructor property represents a reference to the function that generated the prototype object.

The constructor properties of this prototype object can be accessed from an instance by inheritance to:

For the above Person example, the value of mySon.constrictor points to Person, so the following code will be true:

```js
// Define constructor
function Person() {
}

// Create Instance
var mySon = new Person();
var yourSon = new Person();

console.log(mySon.constructor == Person); // true 반환
```

Looking at the constructors, prototype objects, and instance relationships we saw earlier, the following object comparisons are all true:

```js
console.log(mySon.constructor == Person.prototype.constructor); // true 반환
console.log(mySon.constructor == Person); // true 반환
```

What is noteworthy here is that the constructor property is not just a reference to the function object, but a reference to the function object.

The constructor prototype property is a reference that points to the constructor itself, so you can use this value to invoke the function, and thus create objects as follows:

```js
// Define constructor
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}

var mySon = new Person('jaehee');

// Create objects through constructor properties
var myGrandSon = new mySon.constructor('손자');
console.log(myGrandSon.name);
```

MySon.constructor is a reference value that points to the constructor object, so you can call it directly using the () operator or use it with new like code to create an object.

The default values assigned to constructor, such as the prototype property, can also be changed at runtime.

You can also assign an Object constructor to mySon as follows:

```js
mySon.constructor = Object;
```

If you look at the constructor, prototype objects, and instance relationships, there is also a way to access prototype objects through the constructor of the instance.

If you want to access a prototype object through mySon instance, you can do the following:

```js
'MySon.constructor.prototype; // access prototype objects via instance'
```

The constructor becomes available in mySon through inheritance as you saw before.

Therefore, all of the following comparisons are representations of prototype objects:

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}

var mySon = new Person('jaehee');

console.log(mySon.constructor.prototype == Person.prototype); // true 반환
```
