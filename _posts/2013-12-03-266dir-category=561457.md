Once the IP address has been investigated, it is time to request the protocol stack inside the OS to send a message to the web server of the IP address.

### Overview of data sending and receiving behavior

When requesting a message transmission operation to the protocol stack inside the OS, the Socket Library program parts are called in the determined sequence. The following is an image representation of data transmission and reception using Socket Library.

There is something like a channel of data between computers that send and receive data, which flows through it and reaches the other side. Before performing a transmission and reception operation, it is necessary to connect between the incoming and outgoing quantums, and the entrance to this data is called a socket, and this socket should be created first. In fact, the server is building a socket and waiting for the client to connect to the socket.

This process is organized as follows and is all done by the protocol stack inside the OS.

- Make a socket.
- Connect the pipe to the socket on the server side.
- Send and receive data.
- Disconnect the connection and remove the socket.

### Order of socket creation and destruction

- Recall a program part called socket in the socket library
- When a socket is created, it returns to what is called a descriptor, which is received and recorded in memory (the identifier used by the descriptor to identify the socket).
- The protocol stack requests the socket you created to access the socket on the server side, and calls a program part in the socket library called connect to execute this request action.
- When the connection is successful, the protocol stack writes information to the socket, such as the IP address or port number of the connected party.
- When you prepare outgoing data in memory (an HTTP request message based on the URL you entered) and call write, the protocol stack sends outgoing data to the server.
- The data arrives on the server at the access target, and the server executes incoming behavior to investigate the contents of the received data, execute the appropriate processing to return the response message.
- When receiving, specify a memory area (receiving buffer) for storing received response messages and requesting incoming behavior to the protocol stack through a program part called read in the Socket library.
- When the browser completes receiving data, call a program part called close in the Socket Library to disconnect.
- The connection between the sockets is disconnected and the socket is terminated.
