Specifying CSS3 Animation Effects

While transformations and transitions are great technologies like `transitions` and `transforms`, one of the most noticeable changes in CSS3 is the ability to specify animation effects.

Traditionally, you can implement incremental changes in shape over time while giving the effect of variations, transitions, 2D, and 3D, but the limitations of this effect are as follows:

- Only the beginning and end of the transition effect can be specified.

This means that the CSS3 effect is implemented by specifying and removing specific classes or phrases in the CSS, so there is no description of the intermediate appearance (process).

This means that you can only specify the beginning and the end.

- It is difficult to apply sequential effects.

You can`t specify an intermediate step, so you can`t adjust the speed or specify an effect based on a specific time.

To solve this problem, CSS3 introduced the concept of Key Frame, which is the same concept used in tools like flash.

While flash uses the tool to specify keyframes directly over time, CSS3 uses `from`, `to`, or `%` according to progress.

To sum up, it allows us to create animations that are more flexible and adjustable beyond the level of implementation possible in the transformation and transition effects.

### CSS3 Animation

As mentioned above, to make an animation, the key frame must be set first.

The key frame is the starting point and ending point where the transition effect occurs.

The simplest form of animation is made of two keyframes: the start frame and the end frame, but if you create a more complex animation, you can add a few more keyframes in between.

The transition effect, the CSS transition effect, is that it uses virtually only two keyframes, which is distinct from animation.

In CSS, keyframes are defined in the @keyframes rule and use the following syntax:

```css
@keyframes 'name' {
keyframe {
property : value;
}
}
```

The first value of the @keyframe rule is the name (name) of the keyframe, and the keyframe is called through a name that acts as an identifier, causing the defined animation to work.

It is okay to define anything by name, but preferably by name that is associated with the flow of animation, and if you define a associated name, it will be easy to find a particular scene even if multiple keyframes are used later.

The following value, keyframe, specifies where the keyframe will appear during the entire animation time:

You can use either a percent (%) value or a keyword from or to (the value used is between 0 and 100 percent).

There must be at least two keyframes present in this part, and there is no limit to the number of keyframes provided that they have their own location in the animation.

Each keyframe contains a single CSS declaration or a series of declarations applied to the selected element in a particular scene in the animation.

Let`s take a quick look at the example code.

The following code uses three keyframes:

```css
@-webkit-keyframes 'expand' {
from {
border-width : 20px;
}
50% {
border-width : 5px;
}
to {
border-width: 5px;
height: 100px;
width: 200px;
}
}
```

To briefly describe the above code, the element selected at the beginning of the animation has an outline with a border width of 20px, and the outline is reduced by 5px in the middle of the animation.

And at the end of the animation, the appearance line is 1px high and 200px wide, respectively.

The appearance of the elements between each keyframe will gradually change, and at the beginning of the animation and at the 50 percent point, the outline will change smoothly from 20px to 5px.

If you take a closer look, if you don`t change the border value in the last frame and you don`t change the original value in the next key frame of the animation, the value of the element originally intended to be applied to the animation will be inherited, and the feeling of the animation will be significantly different.

The animation will not run so far.

Animation Properties

Once you have set up the keyframe, it is time to control the movement of the elements to be used in the animation.

Many animation properties use the same grammar as the one used in the screen movement (switching) effect.

The order in which you set the animation effect.

- The animation effect is declared as a separate @-webkit-keyframe.
- Specifies the effect of the name and animation state on the declared keyframe per keyframe.
- It uses specific CSS or JavaScript to add animation for use.

Based on what we`ve discussed, you can create simple animations such as:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="206" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/OXqrLd?height=206&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=OXqrLd&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_OXqrLd"></iframe>

Attributes used for animation settings

If you look at the setting of the previous example code, you can interpret the `animation-duration` property as 3s, i.e., running an animation named expand for 3 seconds to apply this effect.

These settings can be specified with the following properties:

- animation-name : declared animation name
- animation-duration : specifies the time run in ms
- animation-timing-function : specifies the rate of deceleration of changes over time such as linear and ease
- animation-teration-count : Specify the number of repetitive effects of an animation (default is 1).
- animation-direction : order in which the animation runs while it repeats (normal by default, alternative by alternative).
- animation-delay : Specifies the delay (waiting) time before the animation starts
- animation-fill-mode : Specifies the status of the target after the animation is applied (backward, forward, bow, none)
- animation-play-state : Specifies whether to continue or stop when stopped during animation.

animation-name (named)

Use the animation-name property to refer to an animation defined in the rule `@-webkit-keyframes` and use only one value for the animation name property.

The only value you can use other than the name is none, which you use to prevent the animation from progressing in the element.

animation-duration (기간)

The property `animation-duration` specifies the duration of the animation and is functionally identical to the property `transition-duration`.

Like the `transition-duration` property, the time value can be in ms or s units, and 0 can be used to prevent animation from proceeding. (If you apply a negative value as a time value, this value is considered to be zero.)

animation-timing-function (time function)

This property is also the same as `transition-timing-function` in terms of functionality and writing grammar.

This animation time function can also use the cubic-bezier function. Please check this value in the transition article.

animation-delay (지연)

It plays a role such as the `transition-delay` attribute as a delay attribute.

The animation delay property also uses a time value in ms or s, which can delay the start of the animation.

where zero means that it starts with no latency, and, like `transition-duration`, using a negative value will skip the animation for that amount of time.

animation-teration-count (number of repetitions)

Unlike the screen movement (switching) effect, which is played only once (including returning to the original state), animation has no limit on the number of plays.

The animation-iteration-count property sets the number of iterations, using the following syntax:

```css
.selector {
animation-iteration-count: count;
}

```

In the above grammar, count uses the keyword number or `infinite`.

The number repeats the animation as many times, the default setting is 1, and the animation is played from beginning to end, and then stopped.

When the infinity value is applied, the animation repeats indefinitely and continues unless it changes according to other conditions.

If you use 0 or negative for this value, the animation will not play.

animation-direction (방향)

Animation is typically played sequentially (such as the transition effect) from the start key frame to the last key frame, but can also be played in reverse order.

In other words, the animation can be played in one direction, or in opposite directions to sequential directions, or in both directions.

Use the `animation-direction` property for this purpose.

```css
.selector {
animation-direction: keyword;
}
```

Use normal or alternative as the keyword value in the direction property.

The default setting value is `normal` to play in the direction of the first scene to the last scene, and if `repeat` is set here, it will play from the beginning again.

If the orientation property is set to `alternate`, the animation will play in reverse immediately after it is played in the default direction.

If you express the repetitive playback of the animation in one cycle, it can be said that in the odd cycle, it is played in the normal direction and in the opposite direction in the even number of cycles.

animation-fill-mode (방향)

You can decide where to put the element at the end of the animation if the CSS location and the animation start position are different, and if the animation is played only once, not indefinitely.

- `forwards`: Wait at the original location of the element until the animation starts. The element stops at the end of the animation.
- `backwards`: When the page is loaded, it immediately moves to the starting position of the animation, and when it is finished, it returns to its original location.
- `Both`: Apply both of the above
- `none`: It will be fixed to its original position before the animation starts, and it will return to its original position when it is finished.
- transition #1
- transition #2
