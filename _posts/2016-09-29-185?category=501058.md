Various out-of-the-box call patterns

Sometimes I saw function declarations with unfamiliar patterns among JavaScript sources.

JavaScript is not strict in grammar and type, so if you don`t understand the characteristics exactly, it may be hard to guess what the code will do.

The following code is the call pattern of the self-execution function that we commonly use.

```js
(function () {

console.log("Hello World!");
})();

(function () {
console.log("Hello javaScript!");
}());
```

Use, recall, and execute the function immediately upon declaration of the function using the () bracket operator.

The following code is an out-of-the-box (self-execution) function call pattern with an unfamiliar pattern:

```js
!function () {
console.log("Hello World!");
}();
```

The above syntax uses the !(feeling) speaker.

Because it is function, the function is interpreted first, and then the function is called and executed due to the () parenthesis operator.

As the function declaration is interpreted first, the operator operates, and the function call is executed immediately.

And because the returned value after function is undefined, the resultant value is denied as !(feeling table) negative operator, which results in true.

In other words, it is an out-of-the-box function call pattern using the fact that the function syntax is interpreted first to run the operator.

In addition to exclamation points, there are more operators that can use the same call pattern.

```js
// Negative operator

!function () {
console.log("Hello World!");
}();

// Exclamation mark twice (forced transformer operator)
!!function () {
console.log("Hello World!");
}();

// Plus
+function () {
console.log("Hello World!");
}();

// Minus
-function () {
console.log("Hello World!");
}();

// Tilde
~function () {
console.log("Hello World!");
}();

// 2 tilde
~~function () {
console.log("Hello World!");
}();
```

> Since the above codes are not commonly used parenthesis call patterns, it would be better to understand that the immediate execution function pattern can be used in the same way as above, since they may fall from the readability of the code.
