Starting with Windows 8, the ability to initialize devices such as smartphones and tablets has been added to recover PCs while preserving data. Both features require an installation DVD or usb.

### Windows PC Initialization

Remove everything from the PC and reinstall Windows in its initial state.
The credentials are retained.
All utilities installed on the desktop are initialized.

- Insert Windows Installation Media (DVD, usb)
- Win + I > Change PC Settings
- selecting updates and recoveries
- Recovery - Remove All Items and Run the Start button for Windows Reinstallation
- PC Initialization - Select Next Button
- Are you sure you want to clean the drive completely? - Select Remove My Files Only
- PC Ready to Initialize - Select Original

When PC initialization begins, the selected drive is formatted and Windows is reinstalled through the installed media. This process involves several reboot operations, and user information is entered when the initialization operation is completed.

If `Remove from All Drives` is selected from the PC initialization option, it will also remove data from all other drives in the system as well as the C drive.

In addition, if you select the option "Completely Clean Up the Drive" when initializing the PC, you will not be able to recover after zero-fill operations, and you will spend a lot of time.

### Windows PC Recovery

Reinstall Windows while maintaining all personal data (C drive), matro style apps, and important PC settings.
The credentials are retained.
All utilities installed on the desktop are initialized.

- Insert Windows Installation Media (DVD, usb)
- Win + I > Change PC Settings
- selecting updates and recoveries
- Recovery - Run the Start button for PC Recovery
- PC Recovery - Select Next Button
- Your PC is Ready to Repair - Select the Refresh button

When the PC recovery operation begins, the installation media that is equipped with reinstalling Windows and retrieving the settings is carried out the setup again. This process involves several reboots, and once the recovery is complete, existing user accounts and settings can be used.

All programs that were previously installed but were removed after PC recovery are saved as HTML documents called "removed apps" on the desktop.

After PC recovery, a folder called Windows.old is created on the C: drive and some old Windows and program data is backed up. Attempting to delete these Windows.old folders from Windows Explorer will cause permission problems and will not delete them normally.

The simplest way to clean up a Windows.old folder is to use Cleanmgr.

- Run command prompt with administrator privileges
- Run cleanmgr
- Disk Cleanup : Drive Selection - C: Selection
- Check previous Windows installation items to clean them up

### Initialize and recover your PC without installation media

To ease the inconvenience of preparing the installation media, it is possible to copy the Windows installation image file (Install.wim) to the hard disk and specify that it will be used for PC recovery and PC initialization.

What`s more convenient is that these Windows installation image files can be placed on the C: drive where Windows is installed, without having to be placed on the data drive separately, so that they are not affected by PC recovery and PC initialization.

- First, create a folder with the appropriate name for any drive (ex. Windows 8Files).
- Next, copy the Install.wim file located in the [Sources] folder on the Windows 8 installation media to the folder you prepared.
- Run a command prompt with administrator privileges and issue the command below.
reagentc /setosimage /path C:\Windows8Files /target C:\Windows /index 1

/Path : Folder path containing Windows installation image files
/Target : The target window to use the image file
/Index : Image index number to be used for the operation [Currently a trial version 1]
From now on, PC recovery and PC initialization will be carried out automatically through the image file without having to prepare Windows installation media separately prepared. Also, the image files and settings do not disappear even after PC recovery and PC initialization.
