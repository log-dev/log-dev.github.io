eval() is evil

If you find `val()` in your code, remember the spell `val() is evil`!

This function takes any string and executes it with JavaScript code.

If the code in question can be known in advance (i.e., it is not determined at runtime), you do not need to write an eval().

When code is dynamically generated at runtime, there is usually a better way to achieve the goal without eval().

### eval() avoid

For example, square brackets would be a simpler and better way to approach a dynamic property.

```js
'// Anti-Pattern
var property = 'name';
console.log(eval('obj.' + property));

// Recommended Pattern
var property = 'name';
console.log(obj[property]);
```

The use of `eval()` is also associated with security issues. It`s because you might be able to execute code that someone tampered with (for example, from the network).

These anti-patterns are common when dealing with JSON responses received by Ajax requests.

To ensure security and validity, we recommend that you use the browser`s built-in method to extrapolate JSON responses.

The library at JSON.org is available for browsers that do not have built-in support for `JSON.parse()`.

In addition, handing over strings to the `setInterval()` and `setTimeout()` and `Function()` generators is quite similar to using eval(), so you should also refrain from using them.

It is the same for JavaScript to evaluate and execute a string delivered by a programming code.

```js
'// Anti-Pattern
setTimeout('myFunc()', 3000);
setTimeout('myFunc(1, 2, 3)', 1000);

// Recommended Pattern
setTimeout(myFunc, 3000);
setTimeout(function () {
myFunc(1, 2, 3);
}, 1000)
```

Using the `new Function()` constructor is similar to eval(), so you need to approach it carefully.

It can be a powerful tool, but it`s often not used properly.

If you must use `eval()`, you can consider using `new Function()` instead.

Since the code evaluated within `new Function()` runs within the effective range of the region function, the variables declared var within the code do not automatically become global variables.

To prevent automatically becoming a global variable, a `eval()` call can also be wrapped as an immediate execution function.

Let`s take a look at the following examples: where the only remaining global variable disrupts the namespace is un.

```js
'console.log(type of un); // 'undefined' is recorded.
console.log (type of deux); // 'undefined' is recorded.
console.log(typeof trois); // 'undefined' 가 기록된다.

var jsstring = 'var un = 1; console.log(un);';
eval(jsstring); // 1 is recorded.

jsstring = 'var deux = 2; console.log(deux);';
new Function(jsstring)(); // 2 is recorded

jsstring = 'var trois = 3; console.log(trois);';
(function () {
eval(jsstring);
})(); // 3 is recorded.

// check the variables on the global scope.
console.log (type of un); // number is recorded.
console.log (type of un); // undefined is recorded.
console.log (type of un); // undefined is recorded.
```

Another difference between eval() and Function constructors is that eval() can interfere with the effective range chain, but Function is more sealed.\

Function is less polluting local variables because it has its own effective range, regardless of where it is executed.

The following example shows that eval() can access and modify its own outer effective range, while Function cannot. (New Function is the same as using Function)

```js
(function () {
var local = 1;
eval('local = 3; console.log(local);'); // 3 이 기록된다.

console.log(local); // contaminate the effective range and 3 is recorded.
})();


(function () {
var local = 1;
Function('console.log(typeof local);')(); // undefined 가 기록된다.
})();
```
