A quick visualization of the path from a web browser to a web server is shown below.

Digital data is divided into small chunks and transported in a bowl called "Packet". The packet contains control information, such as a destination, and many switches or routers jointly view this control information, which transports the packet close to its destination, splitting it into this way and that way.

### a Web browser

When a user enters a URL into a browser on a PC (ex. www.uzuro.com), the browser examines the meaning of the URL according to the rules determined and creates a request message according to the meaning. In the above case, a request message is created to request data from a page stored in a file named www.uzuro.com/index.html, which is sent to the web server. Sending messages is then the role of structures that transport digital data, which is then commissioned to hand over the data. Specifically, the message arrives to the server by requesting the software for network control built into the OS, which only involves the requesting action.

### protocol stack, LAN adapter

In the structure of transporting data, there is a protocol stack built into the OS, and the software for network control is called the "protocol stack". The software stores messages received from browsers in packets and adds control information such as destination addresses. The software plays a variety of roles, such as fixing and sending packets in the event of a communication error or controlling the fundamentals of data communication.

The protocol stack then passes the packet to the LAN adapter (LANCARD). The LAN adapter converts it into an electrical signal and sends it to a cable on the LAN, allowing packets to enter the network.

### hubs, switches, routers

Client PCs can access the Internet at home, over the company`s LAN, or alone. Packets sent by the LAN adapter arrive at the router for Internet access via a switching hub. Since the front part of the router is already the Internet, the front part of the router will be carried by the carrier to the other party.

### access lines, providers

The front part of a router for Internet access, i.e. the inside of the Internet. At the entrance of the Internet is a communication line called an access line. It usually uses telecommunication lines such as telephone lines, ISDN, ADSL, CATV, FTTH, and dedicated lines to connect to the Internet, but is collectively referred to as "access lines". This access line is connected to the contracting provider (the carrier), which has a facility called Point Of Presence (POP).

POP is a router built for communication, which accepts users` Internet requests and sends them nationwide or worldwide. The front part of POP is the core part of the Internet. It has a number of carriers, a vast number of routers installed, routers are connected to each other, and can be thought of as being in the same state as the eyes of a net. The router here then collides and transports the packet toward the intended web server. The technology used in this part is the most important part of today`s network, and the cutting edge of technology development is focused on this part.

### firewall, cache server

When the packet finally arrives on the web server`s LAN, there is a firewall waiting for it to inspect incoming packets. After that, if the cache server is ready, it will be moved to the cache server, and if the requested data exists on the cache server, it will be handled without accessing the web server.

### Web server

When the packet arrives at the web server machine, it extracts the kernel of the packet, restores the original request message, and passes it to the web server application. This is the role of the protocol stack (software for network control) embedded in the OS, as is the client. The web server application then reads the meaning of the request message and forwards the data to the client in the response message according to the instructions written here. At this time, the operation of the response message until it arrives at the client is the opposite of what it has been. When the response returns to the client, the page`s data is extracted from it and displayed on the screen.
