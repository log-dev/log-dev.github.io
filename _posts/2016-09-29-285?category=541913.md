Bringing 2D transformation alive with screen transition capability

As mentioned in the previous posting, CSS transforms can exert their true power and various powers when combined with animation.

Without the help of JavaScript, you can use CSS purely and technically only "CSS3 transition" to show various effects.

### Introduction to CSS transition

Like transform, transition takes its capabilities to the next level in animation format with powerful features added to CSS.

> Do not confuse CSS transitions with CSS animation modules. The latter is completely separate.
Animation modules are much larger, more complex, and have a wide variety of capabilities.

So what is CSS transition and how is it different from CSS animation?

Simply put, transition refers to the animation or transition of an element over a period of time when it changes from one state to another (such as the hover effect).

This tool can replace complex JavaScript code with a single line of CSS that is simple and readable.

The following code shows how many people use the jQuery library to fade elements for 0.5 seconds.

An example of an opacity halving from the circle state when hover is over and returning to its original state when hover is released.

```js
$('a').hover(
function () {
$(this).stop().animate({opacity : '.5'}, 500);
},
function () {
$(this).stop().animate({opacity : '1'}, 500);
});
```

This example is not complicated, but it seems to be a little longer than having a very simple effect.

It should also be taken into account that at least the phrase that jQeury should be included in the code, which means that users need a JavaScript-enabled browser.

The above prediction will be as follows if you change it to a way that uses CSS transitions.

```css
a {
transition: .5s;
}

a:hover {
opacity: .5;
}
```

The above method not only takes much less time and effort than using jQuery, but the code is simplified, making it more readable.

Simple code for simple effects! That`s the standard.

Of course, this example uses minimal grammar to emphasize that it is simple and clear compared to jQuery.

From now on, I would like to learn about these attributes.

### Transition Control

transition-property

One of the properties that controls transition is called `transition-property`.

This property can specify the properties that you want to apply the transition effect.

For example, suppose the background-color is originally yellow, but you want to have a "slowly" change effect to blue in the hover state, and the text color to change from "immediate" black to white.

In other words, background-color wants a transition change, but text color doesn`t want a transition change.

```css
a {
background: yellow;
color: #000;

/* Define the property value where the transition will occur */
transition-property: background-color;
}

a:hover {
background-color: blue;
color: #fff;
}
```

The example above allows only the background-color to have an animation-like effect in the :hover state.

You can also specify an all value in this property. Of course, the transition effect will be applied to all attribute changes.

Because all is the default, you can omit it if you want it to be applied to all property changes.

transition-duration

However, the example above will not work in the current state. Because there is only one thing missing.

This is because there is no transfer control, i.e. `transition-duration` property.

This property can be set to milliseconds (ms) or seconds (second, s) as an attribute that specifies when the transition occurs.

```css
a {
background: yellow;
color: #000;

/* Define the property value where the transition will occur */
transition-property: background-color;

/* Specify the time the transition occurs */
transition-duration: 1s; /* equal to 1000 milliseconds */
}

a:hover {
background-color: blue;
color: #fff;
}
```

The above code means that the background-color will change from yellow to blue and last for 1 second.

transition-timing-function

From now on, a little complicated situation will develop.

This is because the property `transition-timing-function` appears.

This property is simply an attribute that indicates how the transition accelerates and decelerates over the specified time period.

```css
a {
background: yellow;
color: #000;

transition-property: background-color;
transition-duration: 1s; /* equal to 1000 milliseconds */
transition-timing-function: linear;
}

a:hover {
background-color: blue;
color: #fff;
}
```

This timing function (linear) allows the transition to occur at a constant rate throughout the duration of the animation.

The default value of ease is to speed up the transition effect at full speed and then decrease the speed slightly.

Other user-defined keywords are the same type as the short form of the cubic-bezier() function, and we will deal with them later.

transition-delay

Finally, we learn about the `transition-delay` property.

This property allows you to declare and delay a certain amount of time from the time the transition effect occurs until the animation actually starts.

For example, given a value of 0.5s, the animation does not start immediately when the element is in hover state, but starts after 0.5 seconds.

```css
a {
transition-property: background-color;
transition-duration: 1s; /* equal to 1000 milliseconds */
transition-timing-function: linear;
transition-delay: 0.5s; /* 500 milliseconds */
}
```

This is simple and clear.

However, as you may have guessed, combining the attributes into a shortened grammar using the `transition` attribute can be much simpler to use.

### Short Syntax

As mentioned earlier, the essential transition value is the duration parameter.

If the initial value of transition is 0 seconds, the transition is too immediate to be seen.

And there is one rule that must be followed for the order of the two time-related attributes `transition-duration` and `transition-delay`.

You should always specify the duration first.

Other than this, you can set (specify) a variety of values as desired.

The following examples are all valid and produce the same results.

```css
div {
transition: opacity .5s linear 2s;
transition: linear .5s opacity 2s;
transition: linear opacity .5s 2s;
transition: .5s 2s opacity linear;
}
```

### Understanding Transition Properties

The following example shows that you are adding the transition property to the element`s default style without adding it to the :over rule:

Incorrect example

```css
a {
background: blue;
}
a:hover {
background: red;
transition: background .5s ease-in-out;
}
```

Correct example

```css
a {
background: blue;
transition: background .5s ease-in-out;
}
a:hover {
background: red;
}
```

Incorrect example is a common error.

That is, if you want a transition to occur when the element is in the :over state, the transition property must be placed between the :over rules.

This arrangement works when the element is in the :hover state, i.e. changes from the normal state to the :hover state.

However, when :hover is released, the element does not change again incrementally and returns very quickly to its original base style.

Sometimes you may want this effect on purpose, but you`ll generally want the transition to take place slowly in the :hover state and then go back.

So you need to have a different way of thinking so that you don`t make this kind of error.

I understand to some extent why you make this mistake, but when you make this error, the function of the attribute can be significantly limited.

Rather than simply trying to get the animation to work on :hover, you`ll need to use the transition property so that it happens to all the changes.

For example, if the transition property is applied to the base style (the base element), any changes that occur in the element will occur, from the simple :over state to the :focus state, even while using the browser`s zoom control.

If these results are used with these results in mind, there will be no misuse of metastasis and will be able to be applied more accurately where necessary.

### On

As mentioned earlier, when the mouse pointer approaches an element and moves away from it, you may want a different transition effect.

This is the case where the method mentioned earlier is not misused, but rather used effectively.

Let`s check the effect below.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="289" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/GomLxe?height=289&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=GomLxe&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_GomLxe"></iframe>

The code above is that the part about the initial transition used when the element is hover has been moved to the :hover rule, where other `transition` attributes are taken up to be animated when the element changes to its original state.

The results show that when the element is hover, the background color changes from blue to red over a second, and when the hover is released, the red background changes gradually over a longer period of 5 seconds.

You can also create a situation that is a little more complicated than above. Examine the following codes and effects:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="283" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/EPmJRb?height=283&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=EPmJRb&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_EPmJRb"></iframe>

The example above is not much different from the previous code, but it has a fundamentally different effect.

:hover state transfer uses the `transition-property` parameter to animate only the `background` attribute.

This means that the value of 360deg has no effect on the action of the first :hover because the background color is transferred from blue to red for 1 second and no animation has been applied to the rotate() function.(Of course, the 360deg value is the same as the initial 0deg value)

Conversely, the transition property in the default rule, that is, the property that gives the change from hover state to original state, has only the `duration` parameter.

When the mouse pointer deviates from the element, all properties will revert to their original values through the transition effect.

Because the element was rotated in the :hover state (although you didn`t recognize that the rotation occurred because the animation wasn`t applied to the rotation). When the mouse pointer deviates from the element, the element rotates completely at 360deg, returning to its original 0deg value (an animation of transition is applied when returning to the original element).

A brief analysis of the final output is as follows:

- When the user moves the mouse over the element, the background color changes from blue to red for one second.
- When the mouse pointer deviates from the element, the background color changes from red to blue, and the element rotates 360 degrees in a counterclockwise direction in 0.5 seconds.

### Timing Function

As mentioned earlier, the `transition-timing-function` property is about several ways to control the speed at which an animation occurs.

This indicates at what point and at what point the animation will speed up and slow down during the specific time the transition takes place.

And the function `cubic-bezier()` is responsible for creating an accelerating pattern of metastasis.

There are five predefined keywords that transition-timing-function accepts, which can be shortened to a specific cubic-bezier() value.

- ease
- linear
- ease-in
- ease-out
- ease-in-out

Bezier curve

The function `cubic-bezier()` consists of four decimal values (typically in the range of 0 to 1) that help you construct the Bezier curve.

This Vezzier curve determines at what point the transition accelerates and slows down.

The following code shows a typical cubic-bezier() function, which is the same as the keyword `ease-in-out`.

```css
/* cubic-bezier(x, y, x, y);*/
div {
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.42, 0, .58, 1);
}
```

The cubic-bezier() function is not easy to understand the concept.

However, if you look at how the resulting animation matches the Bézier curve, it will be much easier.

Take a look at the Cubic Vazer

stepping function

The timing function can be expressed as a stepping function as well as a Vezzier curve.

The `step()` function does not transfer smoothly, but specifies several steps to separate the animation step by step.

This function accommodates two parameters.

The first is an integer that is a positive number indicating how many steps (minority is not accepted).

The second is the value of start or end, indicating that the change in state must occur at the beginning or end of the step (the end value is optional as the default).

For example, if the interval between each step is 3 seconds, the value of start will induce a change in state at the point where 3 seconds start.

The end value, on the other hand, will induce a state change after 3 seconds.

Take a look at the following example:

```css
div {
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
transition: 5s steps(5, start);
}

div:hover {
transform: translate(500px, 0)
}
```

This code indicates that the div moves by 500px to step 5 for 5 seconds when the hover state is reached.

The step(5, start) function results in the box moving by 100px per second. When the box is hovered, it immediately moves to the 100px point (the first movement is instantaneous thanks to the start parameter).

When you actually use it, you can think of it as a sprite image that contains the frames of the animation.

If you apply the image as the background of an element, then you can use background-position to make the sprite image move all the way to the left and animate this change in position using metastasis.

Check the following behavior:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="290" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/xZdNGa?height=290&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=xZdNGa&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_xZdNGa"></iframe>

### at the end

So far, we`ve learned about the theory of metastasis.

The above-mentioned content may not be enough, but I hope it will help you understand it in general.

Next time, we will talk about the use of the transfer in a more interesting part.
