It often happens when you want to lock the keyboard or mouse input. You can separate the direct connectors, but you can avoid the hassle by making this possible through the program.

### Kid Key Lock Introduction

Kid Key Lock (KKL) is a small cousin program of Pro Key Lock. Simple free software can lock certain keyboard and mouse functions.

KKL is used to avoid accidentally pressing buttons on the keyboard and mouse, and when KKL is running, an icon appears on the taskbar. Clicking on the icon on the taskbar displays a pop-up menu, and all program functions are accessed and set from this menu.

### Install Kid Key Lock

In the middle of the homepage, download links are distributed in installation and portable versions. Installation is carried out without any special process.

Chrome was not downloaded because it was mistaken for malicious code, so it was downloaded using IE.
