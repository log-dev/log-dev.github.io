SSH keys may be required for Git, SSH connections, etc. If you have different SSH keys for Windows or Linux separately, it may be difficult to manage, so let`s try using one SSH key.

### Sharing of SSH Key

At first, I thought it would be solved by vaguely creating an SSH key on Windows and mounting it on WSL or attaching a symbolic link. The problem is that directories and files that are mounted as WSL on Windows or that are symbolic links may have permission problems. In particular, SSH ignores keys that are symbolic linked to Windows because they have strict privileges on private (private) keys. SSH`s manual page provides a very clear description as follows:

- `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
This is a private key for authentication. These files should contain sensitive data, which should be readable by the user, but not accessible by other users (read/write/run). SSH ignores the private key file if it is accessible to other users.

In other words, unlike the initial idea, one key should not be simply stored and shared, but it should be switched to copying it and placing it in both Windows and WSL. Let`s take comfort in using the same key.

### SSH Key Generation in WSL

Due to permission issues, `~/.ssh` and Windows `C:\Users\user name/.I`ll put it in the ssh. First, let`s run WSL to create an SSH key.

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/uzugoer/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/uzugoer/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/uzugoer/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:aFNdpdB2fEPGgEDLQZ8k0Lwc0aF5ddEAjYKAPLQZ8k uzugoer@LUNA-DEV
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
| *O+B+*O=o..o.o=|
| +.=*+* E. O+= |
| .o =.o . o+*|
| + . o oo|
| S . .|
| |
| |
| |
| |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

When an entrepreneur asks for the path and password to be created, files are paired in his home directory in the `.ssh` directory. `id_rsa` is a private key, `id_rsa.pub`, and known_hosts have pingerprint information where they accept the connection configuration (which occurs when they first connect to the server they want to connect remotely and enter yes).

```bash
$ pwd
/home/uzugoer/.ssh

$ ll
total 8
drwx------ 0 uzugoer uzugoer 512 Feb 21 17:04 ./
drwxr-xr-x 0 uzugoer uzugoer 512 Feb 20 19:15 ../
-rw------- 1 uzugoer uzugoer 3243 Feb 21 17:04 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 uzugoer uzugoer 742 Feb 21 17:04 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 uzugoer uzugoer 426 Feb 20 19:37 known_hosts
```

Use commands such as `cp ~/.ssh/. -R/mnt/c/Users/Username/.ssh/` to copy the generated key files to a directory on Windows.

```bash
$ cp ~/.ssh/. -R /mnt/c/Users/uzugo/.ssh/
```

It was copied normally.

The `known_hosts` file can hang symbolic links on Windows and WSL, such as `ln -s /mnt/c/Users/user name/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts` (because it is annoying to ask Windows and WSL connections separately...)

```bash
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/uzugo/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts

$ cd .ssh | ll
total 8
drwx------ 0 uzugoer uzugoer 512 Feb 21 17:45 ./
drwxr-xr-x 0 uzugoer uzugoer 512 Feb 20 19:15 ../
-rw------- 1 uzugoer uzugoer 3243 Feb 21 17:04 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 uzugoer uzugoer 742 Feb 21 17:04 id_rsa.pub
lrwxrwxrwx 1 uzugoer uzugoer 35 Feb 21 17:45 known_hosts -> /mnt/c/Users/uzugo/.ssh/known_hosts*

```

Let`s note that direct access to Linux on Windows is replaced by symbolic links or mounts, and that file creation, modification, and movement are not restricted from Linux to Windows.
