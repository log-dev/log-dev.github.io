In Ubuntu 12.04, the termination command halt sometimes fails to function normally.

In most cases, when the hatl command is issued, the device is expected to power down, but if the OS is shut down and the computer does not power down, the hat command itself can be modified to power down the computer.

### modify halt command

```bash
sudo vi /etc/default/halt

INIT_HALT=poweroff

```

If you modify the above and issue the halt command again, the computer will power down.
