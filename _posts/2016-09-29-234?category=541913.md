Part Center Alignment (vertical alignment)

There are several ways to center (center) elements.

For example, the best known line-height method is only possible if the text/image is single line.

There are also methods to use `position: absolute` and `display: table-cell` as shown above.

Table-cell is often used as follows:

The above mentioned methods require line-height or margin values to be readjusted whenever each corresponding element is centrally aligned when using CSS only.

In addition to the above methods, let`s learn more flexible ways to centralize using virtual elements.

### vertical-align

For your information, like display: table-cell, :before does not support IE7, so crossbrowsing is not possible.

In the figure above, use the method to set height: 100% using the virtual element :before and give vertical-align: middle to the element you want to centralize as well as the virtual element.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="422" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/MaNmXa?height=422&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=MaNmXa&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_MaNmXa"></iframe>
