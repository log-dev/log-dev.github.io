For in door

For in statement is an iterative statement that enumerates the property names of objects.

The for in statement uses the following syntax:

Use an expression on the left side of the in that can be used as a place to substitute.

Grammarly, I use left-sided values. Left-sided values are values that can be written to the left side of the university entrance equation, and it is sufficient to write a variable name.

You can also declare variables within a for in statement, such as a for statement. (The same is true that the scope does not end with a for in statement.)

Next time, we will name this variable loop variable.

Use an object-type expression to the right of in. As you may already know, JavaScript has an implicit shape transformation, and any value can be transformed into an object type, so you can actually use any type of ka.

Therefore, even if you use the Boolean or numeric values, no errors will occur. However, there is no meaning, so you can think of it as using an object-type expression in reality.

A string corresponding to the property name of the object written to the object expression is replaced by a loop variable.

The following code uses the for in statement to enumerate the property name and property value of the object:

In the example above, object obj has three properties, and in the for in statement, the attribute name x, y, and z strings are substituted for the loop variable k.

It is customary for loop variables to have objects as associated arrays, and to frequently use the variable name p or n (=name), which reminds you of the key operation k or key, or the property name.

When displaying property values, use square brackets as shown in obj[k].

### Array and for in statements

If you also place the array as an object, the number of indexes corresponds to the property name, so you can list them in the for in statement as follows:

However, as we will discuss later, we do not recommend using the for in statement when listing array elements.

### precautions in the for in statement

I`ll list three things to be careful about for in door.

> 1. The order in which the Properties are enumerated.
2. The existence of a property that cannot be enumerated
3. Prototype Inherited Property

The order in which the properties are enumerated.

The results for writing to an object literal expression are in order, but are not listed in the order in which they are written to the object literal.

In other words, the order is not guaranteed. There is no order between the original properties, so it is wrong to be aware of the order.

On the other hand, in the case of an array, it is an order-conscious data type.

The array code above also shows the expected order, but the for in statement does not guarantee the order and should not be overly dependent on this behavior.

The existence of a property that cannot be enumerated

The second caveat is for properties that cannot be listed in the for in statement.

For example, an array object has a length property, but cannot be enumerated in the for in statement as in the code above.

This is because the length property is a property that cannot be enumerated.

Prototype Inherited Property

The third caveat is that the for in statement also lists the properties inherited from the prototype.
