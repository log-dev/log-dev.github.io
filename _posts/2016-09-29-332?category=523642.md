Syntax

```js
array.join(separator);
```

Parameters

Return value

string

Description

Combine elements in an array with the first factor (separator) to create a single string.

This is the opposite of `string.split`.

Example Code

```js
var a = new Array("welcome","coding","everybody");
Because '' was passed as the first factor of // join, the return value returns a result with a space between the element and the element.
console.log(a.join(' ')); // string, welcome coding everybody
```
