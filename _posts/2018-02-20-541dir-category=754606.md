### WSL System Requirements

Unfortunately, WSL cannot be installed if the following requirements are not met:

- OS: Windows 10 version 1607 or later
- Architecture: x64
- Account : Sign in to your PC with an email account (except local users - for MS Store use)

On the Windows taskbar, type PC Information in the search box and select it (Settings > System > Information). Let`s look at the items below and check your system.

If the version is low, let`s work through Settings > Update and Repair > Update Windows.

### WSL Installation

When you select Control Panel 판 Programs and Features - Turn Windows Features On/Off as shown below and activate the checkbox for the Windows subsystem for Linux, the functionality installation is rebooted.

Once downloaded and selected Run, a console window opens and the WSL installation task proceeds. The user account requires input during installation, which is totally unrelated to Windows, so let`s set it up freely and enter the password.

Let`s enter a basic Linux command and check the results.

```bash
lsb_release -a
pwd
ls -al
date
```
