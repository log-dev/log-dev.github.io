Let`s summarize the authentication methods for each Windows version and edition are different.

### Windows version

The most popular versions of Windows on Desktop are Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1.

Current versions of Windows are Windows 2003, Windows 2008, Windows 2008 R2, Windows 2013 and Windows 2013 R2.

### Windows Edition

Windows Vista and Windows 7 have the same types of editions, and Windows 8 has simplified them.

- Windows XP is an antiquated artifact and is not used except for Pro.
- The differences between editions of Windows 7 are as follows.
- The differences between editions of Windows 8 are as follows.

Windows RT was the first version of Windows to support the ARM architecture. It is only available in preinstalled form on ARM-based devices such as tablet PCs, and is named after the Windows Runtime (WinRT) development platform that Microsoft introduces on Windows 8. It is equipped with Office 2013 main program (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote) optimized for touch interface and supports device encryption. It does not include functions for business, such as group policy or domain support.

The following part-time jobs are added to the Windows edition name, which is somewhat different from the regular version.

- N: Windows Media Player is not pre-loaded. It was announced in 2004 after the European Commission ordered Microsoft not to pre-load Windows Media Player. In South Korea, the characteristics of the K version are included.
- E: Internet Explorer is a pre-loaded version. It is offered separately in only some languages in Europe.
- K: A version that includes a messenger center and a media player center, which is available only in South Korea. After the 2006 Fair Trade Commission lawsuit against Messenger and Media Player exclusivity, it was announced separately to ensure users` choice. It is true that K version is only available in Korea, but K itself does not mean that it is a Korean version. Since only K versions are available in South Korea, K is not usually added.

Upgrades from Windows 7 are supported as shown in the following table below. Like other operating systems, upgrading from 32-bit to 64-bit or 64-bit to 32-bit is not possible, and Windows RT supports only ARM architecture, so it cannot be installed on any hardware running Windows 7. In addition, Windows XP and Windows Vista can only be upgraded to Windows 8 Pro.

### Types and characteristics of Windows licenses

Learn about the system of complex MS licenses.

It is a packaged license product that can be purchased at local dealerships or local software outlets, providing individual license keys regardless of customer size, and is commonly referred to as the Retail version (permanent license). There is no right to downgrade.

Microsoft Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and others are available only.

GGK can be used if a fully assembled PC is installed with pirated copies of Windows or unlicensed Windows. It is not available for new PCs and, like FFP, is supported by Microsoft and does not have downgrade rights. It can be used on at least one or more four PCs.

GGWA is an activation license solution that upgrades an OS that illegally uses Windows through a Windows Volume License Agreement (Windows XP Home DSP) to a legitimate Windows 7 license that meets Microsoft`s requirements. It can be used on more than five PCs (which can be considered a GGK mass-selling product).

For software licenses such as PC rooms and hotels, you must have MS-designated Rental Rights (only Professional or Business units can purchase Rental Rights). You will only be given the right to reimaging if you purchase Rental Rights.

What is reimaging? Ability to replicate a single Windows image to multiple PCs

OEM licenses are divided into two categories:

SLP is a method that was introduced to process large amounts of products because it cannot process authentication one by one at large companies. It is a method of setting up an OS on a master PC and capturing images to distribute the same images to the same models. Authentication is successful if the SLP key matches the information contained in the digital license file with the SLIC table present on the bios. Large enterprise keys were leaked, and SLIC tables were bypassed via virtual bios or modified bios.

COA is a common OEM CD-Key. Stickers next to the main body of a large company`s PC, or stickers on the bottom of a laptop. It refers to the CDKey, and the DSP version sold in Yongsan is the same. The original DSP version cannot be sold individually. DSP is the product that large assembly PC vendors such as Compuzone and Asacom sell assembly finished products by inserting OS. In reality, however, individual purchases can be made. This COA key is limited compared to the retail key, which in principle requires only the PC to be used, so only the first time is Internet activated, and if the hardware configuration does not change, it does not matter if the computer is upgraded. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain telephone certification in that case. This COA key is valid only on the PC at the time of release, and if it is authenticated using it on another PC, it is a violation of the license.

One of the most beloved dark ways in Windows XP was the Professional Volume License. The main reason was that there was no Windows Product Activation (WPA) process that required activation within 30 days. In the retail version, even if a CD key is entered during installation, it must be authenticated within 30 days through the Internet, but volume licensing did not require that process. If you enter a CD key only at installation time, you can use it without any restrictions.

However, the policy changed from Vista, requiring the activation process even for volume licenses.

There are two types of volume licenses.

MAK can literally be activated on a large number of PCs. It is used in professional and enterprise versions of Windows 7, and sometimes new MAKs are leaked over the Internet, which Microsoft blocks when they are certified on more than a certain number of PCs. Instead, there is a way to back up the token file once authenticated and activate it with the token file that was authenticated when it was installed again later.

For large companies that need to purchase licenses, this is very wasteful if all PCs use a method of connecting and authenticating to MS servers. Therefore, it is KMS that each company builds its own certificate server and manages its own certification. However, there have been cases where crackers on continents play the role of this KMS certificate server, and of course, they are often blocked or changed addresses... There is also a VMWare self-KMS authentication method used to solve this problem. They build their own KMS certificate servers in VMWare and process their own authentication within their own computers. Of course, since the built-in default KMS key is used, MS activations on the Internet, such as WGA, will not be passed later, and this is not a significant limitation for those who use it without updating.
