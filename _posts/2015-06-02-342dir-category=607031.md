### outline

It is an abbreviated property, similar to a border, but does not occupy space, and may not be a rectangle.

```css
p {outline: #00FF00 dotted thick;}

```

- Write attribute values in order of outline-color, outline-style, and outline-width.
- If any values are omitted, the default value is applied.

- outline-color: Specifies the color of outline.
- outline-style : Specifies the style of the outline.
- outline-width : Specifies the width of the outline.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.outline="#0000FF dotted thin"

```
