CentOS 6.4 minimal has a postfix mail server built by default. You can use this to send and receive e-mails to users within the Linux server.

It`s important that you have a fixed IP before you build a postfix mail server. Anyone can build mail servers, but most domains or IP addresses that are not registered as white domains are spammed. If you don`t have a fixed IP, please refer to sending an email using Gmail`s SMTP.

Currently, SPF is registered on the name server and white domain is registered. https://www.kisarbl.or.kr/

I sent an e-mail using the e-mail command.

naver.com - Mail transmission was possible.

daum.net - Mail transmission denied and returned.

gmail.com - A mail was sent but moved to a spam mailbox.

### install postfix

If postfix is not installed, install it.

```bash
yum -y install postfix

```

Registration of Services

```bash
chkconfig postfix on

```

Start of Service

```bash
service postfix start

```

### Use of naver works

It has been trying to build a mail server, but has given up for now. Without static IP, the reverse setting of DNS does not register PTR.

Currently, famous mail servers require PTRs, so mail is rejected and returned or treated as spam. Therefore, I decided to use naver works and changed the MX record.

IN MX 10 dmx-1.naver.com.

IN MX 20 dmx-2.naver.com.

If you register naver works after changing the MX record, it becomes available after the update time of the MX record. One problem is that I would like to be briefed by root@uzuro.com on the overall system situation, such as security-related intrusion, after completing any work on the current Linux system.

The default postfix setting is that if the system sends mail to root@uzuro.com, the system itself sends mail to root. I had to send it to the mail address of Naver works, so I made some changes.

```bash
vi /etc/postfix/main.cf

myhostname = mail.uzuro.com
mydomain = mail.uzuro.com
inet_interfaces = localhost
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost
mynetworks_style = host

```

When I logged on to root on the Linux system and sent an e-mail to naverworks using the e-mail command, it is considered spam. First of all, the Linux system does not seem to matter much because the only days to send an e-mail are those determined above. After spamming the mail that came from Naver`s spam mailbox to root@mail.uzuro.com, it was handled normally.
