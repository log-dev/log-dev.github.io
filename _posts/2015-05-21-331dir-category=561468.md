Learn about Response.js, which are used by bootstraps and many web developments.

### Introducing Response.js

It is a JavaScript library that allows interpretation of media queries in IE 6â€“8. Because it has an unrestricted MIT or BSD license for any purpose, it can be downloaded and used from github at any time without erasing the license expressions contained in the source code.

### How to Use Response.js

IE8 Use conditional annotations for use only in versions below. It is located in `head`.js so that it can be loaded as soon as it starts, and it must be tested in a web server environment for it to work.

The following is a link to a file that was downloaded directly from the CDN.

```html
<head>
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="https://oss.maxcdn.com/libs/respond.js/1.4.2/respond.min.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
</head>

```

### CDN/X-Domain Setup

Response.js works by requesting a copy of the CSS via AJAX. Thus, if CSS is hosted over a CDN (or subdomain), it is necessary to upload a proxy page that enables communication between domains.

See cross-domain/example.html demo:

- Upload `cross-domain/response-proxy.html` to an external domain.
- Upload `cross-domain/response.proxy.gif` to the original domain.
- See file via `link` element:
HTML
` <!-- Respond.js proxy on external server -->
<link href="http://externalcdn.com/respond-proxy.html" id="respond-proxy" rel="respond-proxy" />

<!-- Respond.js redirect location on local server -->
<link href="/path/to/respond.proxy.gif" id="respond-redirect" rel="respond-redirect" />

<!-- Respond.js proxy script on local server -->
<script src="/path/to/respond.proxy.js"></script>
`

If you are having problems with the cross-domain setup, make sure respond-proxy.html does not have a query string appended to it.

### Support and Precautions for Response.js

Some things to keep in mind:

- This script intentionally supports very few parts: `min-width` and `max-width` queries and browsers that do not support all media types (screen, print, etc.). Since it wanted to maintain simplicity in file size, maintenance, and performance, it has deliberately supported queries that are essential to building reactive (mobile first technique) designs. There may be rework in the future, including additional media query functions.
- By default, browsers that support CSS3 media query uninstall this script as soon as possible. In the support test, all other browsers conduct a quick test to determine whether or not to support media queries before running the script. This test is included separately at the top and uses a `window.matchMedia` polyfill (https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js). If you are already using polyfill like Modernizr, please remove that part.
- This script is not dependent on other frameworks or scripts, but optimizes mobile transmissions (~1Kb file size min/gzip).
- As your guess is, this implementation is a fool when it comes to CSS interpretation rules. While there are advantages that run really fast, this looseness may cause unexpected behavior. For example: if you comment to disable a media query rule, you will notice that a browser that does not support media query will activate the rule.
- Respond.js does not interpret the CSS referenced by `@import` and does not re-request for interpretation, so the media query does not work within the `style` element (Respond.js doesn`t pass CSS referenced via @import, nor does it work with media).
- Due to security restrictions, some browsers do not allow this script to work with the URL `file://` (because it uses XMLHttpRequest). Run it on the web server.
- If a CSS request containing MQ-specific styling is followed by a redirect, Response.js fails automatically. The CSS file responds with a status of 200.
- Currently, media query properties are supported for the `link` element, but only if the linked stylesheet does not have media query. If it contains queries, the media properties will be ignored and the internal queries will be interpreted normally. In other words, the priority of CSS is `@media` syntax.
- Reportedly, if the CSS file is encoded in UTF-8 with Byte-Order-Mark (BOM), Response.js will not work with IE7 and 8. Noted in issue #97
- Note: If the attribute `@font-face` is included in the media query, IE7 and 8 may be interrupted during loading. To solve this problem, `@font-face` properties should be written externally.
- If more than 32 CSSs are referenced, IE will generate an Invalid procedure call or argument error.
- The Sass/SCSS source map is not supported; @media-sass-debug-info discontinues Response.js. Noted in issue #148
- IE 9 supports CSS3 media queries, but not when there is a CSS that contains media queries in an external file in the frame (see this bug). Also, see how to solve this problem.
- Nested media queries are not supported.
