This description of how to build a Git server in Ubuntu can be used as a collaborative environment or as a concept for backup storage other than local storage.

Before establishing a Git server, consider using GitHub or Gitlab for free online use. If GitHub is an open project, if GitHub is a private project, if GitLab is used, there is no need to set up a separate server.

| | Git | GitHub | GitLab |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Service Type** | Package/Source Installation Delivery | Online Services | Package/Source/Online Services Delivery |
| **Online Service Constraints** | None | Private Projects Fee | Capacity Limit of 1Gb per Repository |

The following is based on the assumption that an OpenSSH server is installed and SSH is used as a protocol.

### Install the latest version of Git

In Ubuntu 12.04.02, version 1.7.9 is installed when git is installed. PPA should be used to use the latest version.

If `add-apt-repository` command that is used to use PPA does not work, `python-software-properties` can be installed, and if there is a problem, `software-properties-common` can be installed.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core
git version

```

### Git Access Management

There are three ways to establish access to git:

This method is not recommended because it is more vulnerable than the two methods below for security reasons and follows the administrator`s hard work because it requires the user`s account to be accessed and authorized to access the server.

This method is often used when using a repository where permission settings are not complicated by creating a representative user (git) and granting minimal privileges to registered users using SSH keys. However, users who are allowed to access the repository can also push/pull other repositories, so they cannot be recommended if they need careful attention.

It is recommended to operate multiple repositories and to set each access to the desired setting. Each branch, tag, and storage-specific access can be established and group management is possible. It is also convenient to set up public/private storage.

Here we describe the methods in number 2 and then the methods in number 3.

Create a representative account and change storage permissions

```bash
# Create user, enter password
sudo adduser git

Log in as a # git user
su git

```

The git account created above is used to connect with no effect on commit.

Register SSH-key with git user`s home directory

```bash
"# Go to Home Directory
cd ~

# .ssh Create Directory
mkdir .ssh

# Change Permissions
chmod 700 .ssh

# Send public key to server and register
cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Change Permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Delete user keys that have been sent
rm -rf id_rsa.pub

```

You can send the public key of the users who will grant access to the git repository in any way (email) and continue to register it.

Access test is done by registering SSH-Key when it is connected directly without asking for a password after accessing `ssh git@server address`.

### Shell capability limitations for security

Users accessing git accounts should not swing around the server with their assigned rights, so this is restricted.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/passwd

git:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/git:/bin/bash

```

Find the git account above and change the /bin/bash part to /usr/bin/git-shell.

```undefined
git:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/git:/usr/bin/git-shell

```

If you reconnect, you will be denied access.

### creating a Git repository

Create the desired location to be used as a repository for git. The following creates a repository in the git user`s home directory created above.

```bash
Go to the home directory while logging in as a "# git user"
cd ~

# Create a directory to use as a repository
mkdir repos

```

Create a directory under the project name because we will create multiple repositories. By convention, the name of the repository ends with *.git.

```bash
mkdir test_project.git

```

Remote storage is a storage without a working directory.

When you give the --bare option to a command in general local storage creation, the remote storage is created, and the --shared option automatically adds group write permissions.

```bash
cd /home/git/repos/test_project.git
git init --bare --shared

```

The following files are created.

```undefined
drwxrwsr-x 7 root root 4096 Aug 29 02:16 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Aug 29 02:07 ..
drwxrwsr-x 2 root root 4096 Aug 29 02:16 branches
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 126 Aug 29 02:16 config
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 73 Aug 29 02:16 description
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root 23 Aug 29 02:16 HEAD
drwxrwsr-x 2 root root 4096 Aug 29 02:16 hooks
drwxrwsr-x 2 root root 4096 Aug 29 02:16 info
drwxrwsr-x 4 root root 4096 Aug 29 02:16 objects
drwxrwsr-x 4 root root 4096 Aug 29 02:16 refs

```

```bash
git clone --bare --shared URL주소

```

### Access Test

Download the remote storage from the client.

```bash
git clone ssh://git@서버주소:/home/git/repos/test_project.git

```

Remove existing remotes

```bash
git remote remove origin

```

### TroubleShooting

If there is a problem with the repertoire commission, you will see the following error syntax.

insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database ./objects

To run next to go to that repajitori.

```bash
cd /home/git/repos
sudo chmod -R 770 *

```

If not, let`s specify the shared repository option as true as follows.

```bash
sudo git config core.sharedrepository true

```
