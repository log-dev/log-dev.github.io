How does the browser work?

When a user requests data to a server at a connected address, the web browser interprets the data downloaded from the server and completes the UI that the user sees. So the web is very important to the network is very important.

Here, we need to understand the principles of interpreting HTML, CSS, and JS downloaded from the server, and we will cover this content.

### Get a quick look at how your web browser works

The main function of the browser is to request the server and display the resources you select in the browser. Resources are usually HTML documents, but they can be PDFs, images, or other forms. The address of the resource is determined by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

The browser interprets and displays HTML files according to HTML and CSS specifications, which are set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a web standardization organization. In the past, web creators had severe compatibility issues with browsers implementing only a few of these specifications and extending them in their own ways, but today most browsers follow the standard.

Browser`s default for browsers

The main components of the browser are as follows:

- User interface - Address bar, Previous/Next button, Bookmark menu, etc. All other parts except the window showing the requested page.
- Browser Engine - Controls the behavior between the user interface and the rendering engine.
- Rendering Engine - Displays the requested content. For example, when HTML is requested, HTML and CSS are parsed and displayed on the screen.
- Communication - Used for network calls, such as HTTP requests. It is a platform-independent interface and runs under each platform.
- UI Backend - Illustrates basic devices such as combo boxes and windows. A generic interface not specified by the platform, using an OS user interface scheme.
- JavaScript Interpreter - interprets and executes JavaScript code.
- A data repository - this part is a layer that stores data. It is necessary to store all kinds of resources on a hard disk, such as storing cookies. The HTML5 specification defines a browser-supported `web database`.

[Key components of the browser ]

Rendering Engine

The role of the rendering engine is to display the requested content on the browser screen.

The rendering engine can display HTML and XML documents and images. Of course, you can use plug-ins or browser extensions to display other types, such as PDFs.

Typical rendering engines include Firefox and Webkit engines, which use the Gecko engine made by Mozilla, while Safari and Chrome use the Webkit engine.

The Webkit was an open-source engine built to operate on the first Linux platform, modified by Apple to support Safari browsers on Mac and Windows. For more information, visit webkit.org.

What the browser does while interpreting documents (HTML)

The browser does the following by default:

- Loading - Loader is the process of reading a resource stream that is delivered to an HTTP module or file system. Rather than simply reading, the loader checks whether it has already read the data, decides whether to open a pop-up window or download the file.
- Parsing - Parsing is the process of creating a `DOM (Document Object Model) tree, usually with HTML and XML parsers. HTML parsers are literally used to interpret HTML documents, while XML parsers are used to handle SVG, MathML, etc. following XML formats.
- Creating a Rendering Tree - A DOM tree generated by parsing is a data structure of the contents of an HTML/XML document in the form of a tree. In other words, the DOM tree stores the content itself and requires a separate tree structure to store location, size information, and order of drawing, which is commonly referred to as the rendering tree.
- CSS Style Determination - CSS was created to represent expressions separately from HTML document content
- Layout - When a rendering tree is created, the process by which each render object has its position and size is called layout.
- Painting - The drawing phase is the process of filling RGB values in a particular memory space while exploring the rendering tree.

### Progress order for scripts and style sheets

The following are commonly used code:

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Title</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="default.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="pages.css">
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="user.ui.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<img src="/images/sample.png" alt="">

<ul>
Parsing <li>HTML</li>
>Load external CSS files and external JavaScript files</li>
<li>Run when JavaScript is delivered</li>
<li>DOM tree is deployed</li>
Load external resources such as >image files and flash</li
<li>All done</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
```

Typically, when the browser encounters these documents, it parses HTML and loads the external resources CSS and JS files.

JavaScript runs at the time it is delivered, and after completing the deployment of the DOM tree, it loads external resources such as image files and flash, and all operations are completed.

What`s important here is what happens when you meet a script.

When you meet the JS tag, the <script>, the parsing of the document stops while the script is interpreted and executed.

If the script is external, you must first import resources from the network, which is also processed in real time and parsing stops until you receive the resources.

This model has lasted for many years and is also defined in HTML4 and HTML5 specifications.

On the other hand, style sheets do not theoretically change the DOM tree, so they do not wait or interrupt document parsing.

The above code calls up the style first and then loads the script, but if you load the scriptr file first, that is, if the script requests style information while parsing the document, that`s a problem.

This will result in a drop in user experience (UX) because the browser will not perform any other tasks while the script parses the document, which will likely result in the style being parsed and the screen layout being poorly configured and providing the user with a view. This seems unusual, but it happens very often.

To avoid causing this problem and compromising the user experience, we recommend placing the script source at the end of the body tag as follows:

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Title</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="default.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="pages.css">
</head>
<body>
<img src="/images/sample.png" alt="">

<ul>
Parsing <li>HTML</li>
>Load external CSS files and external JavaScript files</li>
<li>Run when JavaScript is delivered</li>
<li>DOM tree is deployed</li>
Load external resources such as >image files and flash</li
<li>All done</li>
</ul>
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="user.ui.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

As shown above, placing the script source at the bottom will speed up the display of HTML documents on the screen and may not cause inconvenience to users because they have interpreted some of the documents required to view the view.

### When to load the script - async, refer

As far as we know, inserting scripts before the end of a document (</body>) can do the same with older browsers, improving user experience and reducing the need to process programming using events.

However, if a script is inserted in the document`s `head` area or defined in an external file, the event association should be handled according to the document`s load point.

If you insert it into the head like this, you can use the defer, async properties in a modern browser, and you want to learn about this.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/997E613B5C4E6E1B0D)

When you open the Chrome Developer Tools and view the network panel, you can see visually the results of downloading all the resources needed to configure the web page from the bottom of the network panel, including the total time it took to download all the resources, the number of requests made to the server, and the size of the transferred files.

You can check `DOMContentLoaded` and `Load` on this network panel.

First, `DOMContentLoaded` refers to when the DOM tree is completed.
In other words, it interprets and configures HTML Elements that exclude external resources (iframes, images) such as images (ex. embedded types).

And `Load` refers to the state in which all content (images, scripts, css, etc.) in the document is loaded.

This usually results in image files being loaded between or after the end of DOMContentLoaded and the end of the load.

Please refer to the loading point of the document for more information because it is not a time to cover script events.

Typical execution of scripts

Before learning about the behavior of `async` and `defer`, learn about the basic `script` execution process.

By default, `script` can be interpreted and executed immediately for inline code, but otherwise, it stops parsing HTML documents until the file is imported.

![image](https://www.growingwiththeweb.com/images/2014/02/26/script.svg)

As shown in the figure above, HTML parsing is paused to import and run scripts, which increases the time HTML is output to the screen.

Run when async property is added

The `async` property can be used to indicate to the browser that script files can run asynchronously (synchronous vs asynchronous).

This means that the HTML parser does not need to pause to import and execute scripts from the point where they reach the script tag.

This allows you to import scripts in parallel with HTML parsing and run them immediately whenever they are ready.

Therefore, it is important to note when using async for scripts where the order of execution is important because the order of execution is determined at the time of download completion.

For example, suppose your author uses jQuery.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Title</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="default.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="pages.css">
<script async src="jquery.js"></script>
<script async src="user.ui.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<img src="/images/sample.png" alt="">
<ul>
Parsing <li>HTML</li>
>Load external CSS files and external JavaScript files</li>
<li>Run when JavaScript is delivered</li>
<li>DOM tree is deployed</li>
Load external resources such as >image files and flash</li
<li>All done</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
```

The code above used the async property, which includes the jQuery library and the custom user.ui.js.

It should be noted that if the author is referring to an element with jQuery, declaring the jquery library first does not guarantee that it will run first.

If there is a user who usually uses J-query, I will call J-query first and then use J-query grammar.

As such, if the script I use depends on J-Query, I can say that I have a dependency on J-Query.

This is called dependency.

What if the user-written script is dependent on jQuery and the download of jQuery is slower than the user script?

As mentioned above, `async` determines when the download completes, so if jQuery is slower to complete the download, the element you refer to as jQuery will not be found as `undefined`.

In other words, if a user script that relies on jQuery runs first, the jQuery library is in an unavailable state.

However, HTML5 spec was added to run in the order of call when specifying the attribute `async="false" (default : true).

Run when defer property is added

Unlike async (default true), the `defer` property instructs the browser to run the script file when HTML parsing is complete.

```undefined
<script defer src="jquery.js"></script>
<script defer src="user.ui.js"></script>
```

Asynchronously loaded scripts, script files can be downloaded while HTML parsing is running (without interfering with HTML interpretation).

Here, there is a difference between async properties.

If the script is downloaded before HTML parsing is complete, the script will not run until the syntax interpretation is complete.

It also runs in the order in which it is called, unlike `async`.

![image](https://www.growingwiththeweb.com/images/2014/02/26/script-defer.svg)

This is why downloading a script declared first runs in the order it is called, even if it is late to complete, so it is different from the case of `defer="true" which is likely to lose dependency above.

Then when should I use it?

There are a few things you need to check to determine whether to run a typical script or run a `aync` or `defer` execution.

Where is the `script` element?

If the `<script>` element is not at the end of the document, asynchronous and delayed execution of the script is more important.

HTML documents are parsed from the first opening <html> element to the closing sequence.

If the external source JavaScript file is directly in front of the closing </body> element, using the async or defer property will not do much.(There is no significant meaning for delay because HTML parsers have completed the majority of the documents by that point).

Depending on the dependence (dependence) of the script file,

The async property is particularly useful for script files that are not dependent on other files or do not have dependencies themselves.

The asynchronous load may be best suited because you don`t need to know exactly where the file runs.

You can also use defer in situations where you need to place a script file that is dependent or for some reason the file in question in a different location.

browsers that support async and defer

The async and defer properties are very widely supported based on the latest browsers, but the behavior of these properties may vary slightly between JavaScript engines.

Before you find out which browsers are supported, you will learn how to behave in cases that are only partially supported. With the defer property, the script runs after the page is parsed.

However, if both async and defer properties are specified, modern browsers that support async properties follow async properties by default.

However, older browsers that do not support the async property have different results depending on whether the defer property supports it. If the defer property is supported, older browsers that run the script asynchronously by the defer property and do not even support defer run the script synchronously.

IE is exceptional, but it is still not supported by the domestic environment, but at a time when its share below IE 10 is extremely low, it should now be at a level that is not considered.
Rather than using the aync, defer property, it is most recommended to declare a script immediately before `</body>.
