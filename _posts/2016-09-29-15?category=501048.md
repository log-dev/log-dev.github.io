Prototype

Unlike JavaScript, which defines classes such as C++ and Java, creating objects through them and programming them object-oriented, there is no concept of classes.

Instead, it supports object-oriented programming by creating objects with object literals or constructor functions, and the parent object of objects created with object literal, constructor functions is a "prototype object".

That is, like the inheritance concept, child objects allow access to the property that the parent object has or invokes by inheriting the method.

Therefore, JavaScript allows support for object-oriented programming based on prototypes rather than class-based ones.

Every object in JavaScript has a hidden property that points to a prototype object, which is the parent of the object itself, which is a prototype property and is implemented in the form __proto___ in a Chrome browser.

There is a distinction here that, as described in the basic property of the function object, the function object`s own prototype property and the hidden prototype property __proto__.

Let`s find out the difference between these two.

prototype Properties vs __proto__

JavaScript has an object literal method of creating objects and a constructor function.

First of all, it is necessary to understand the rules when objects are created in these two ways.

In JavaScript, all objects are associated with __proto___ that represent the prototype object pointed to by the prototype property of the constructor function that created them as their own parent object.

Let`s take a look at the following example code.

Create objects with a constructor function

If you look at the results screen in the console window of the Chrome browser, you can see prototype: Person in the first console item and __proto__: Person in the second console item.

* From Person

Prototype: A person`s prototype property is an object that is created when a function is created and has only one constructor property.

In other words, people.prototype and person() refer to each other because they point to a prototype object that is linked to them from the perspective of the function.

*From Jaehee

__proto_: Person is the object`s own parent object, the prototype object, which is a hidden link inside and is generated by the constructor function, so the person.prototype is the prototype object of Jaehee, given that __proto__, which, as mentioned above, refers to the person.

After all, creating objects in JavaScript is the role of the constructor function, but acting as the actual parent of the generated object is the prototype object that the constructor`s prototype property points to, rather than the generated object itself.

In JavaScript, the difference between a generic function and a constructor function is:

Although the general function and the constructor function do not differ separately, calling the function by attaching a new operator acts as a constructor function.

When a constructor function written for object generation is called without new, or when a code written for general function generation is called with new attached, it can occur.

This is because this binding scheme is different when calling constructor functions and normal functions.

This is because in a constructor function call, this binds to an object generated by the new constructor function () while this binds to a window global object.

Therefore, JavaScript recommends capitalizing the first letter of the function name to emphasize that the code was written as a constructor function when writing the constructor function.
