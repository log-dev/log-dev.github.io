The photo attachment feature of the T-story Editor examines the factors that affect or affect the insertion of an image, which can be limited to skin production. In addition to skin production, if you know before you start the blog, you can reduce the problems of skin changes in the future.

### Understanding T-Story Body Width

When referring to the width of the text of T-story, most people think of the width of writing. This can be set in the TISTORY management → writing setting → writing record width of the writing environment, and the setting value determines the size of the image inserted. In fact, we are often confused in this regard, so we will learn more about it.

Even if the width of the writing is set to the desired value, the width of the body of the actual skin does not change. This should include the body width setting part of the skin that directly modifies the style sheet file or supports Skin Wizard.

```css
.article { width:/*@post-width*/550px/*@*/; }

```

If the skin has a similar setting as above, you can modify the width of the actual part shown in Skin Wizard.

If you match the width of the body of the skin with the width of the writing width, it will be seen as writing. In fact, many skins do, but it should be noted that reactive designs often do not fix them to change the width of the skin`s body fluidly. In other words, the width of the text can change to a percentage percentage depending on the width of the device. This can be a problem when you want the image or embodiment elements (video or other) to be inserted into the body to be fully shown in the body width.

Images inserted into the T-Story editor store a copy of the text in the size of the width of the writing set at the time of attachment of the photo, rather than the actual original size, and print the copy in the text. This can be a stumbling block if you devise a skin design with the width of the aforementioned fluid text or a design in which images overlap the margins of the text. In addition, copies of the images are stored according to the width of the previous skin when changing the skin, which may be embarrassing to the size of the images that are different from the intentions after changing the skin.

To compensate for this, the width of the writing should be sufficient when writing from the beginning. Moderately reducing large images is less damaging, but increasing small images to fit the size of the text is more damaging, so consider future skin changes and set the appropriate width. Of course, be aware that there may be traffic growth and slower loading as copies of the images are stored as much as the size of the increased width.

### T-Story Image Format

You may want to change the skin or change the size of previously uploaded images collectively for a specific purpose. It is easy to use a style sheet, but the closer it is to the original, the worse the image will be. T-story has hidden ways to obtain the size of various images with strings declared in the path of the image, which can be referenced to write scripts.

format) http://cfile[number].uf.tistory.com/ [image size]/[unique number]
Example) https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/221DC14455E9E73018?original

The number portion is randomly specified, which seems to be randomly specified by the T-story CDN server. Keep in mind that even within one article of the same blog, the corresponding number for the image will be randomly attached.

The size of the image is determined by using several keywords that specify the image size.

- Original: refers to the original file of the image uploaded through the T-story editor.
- image : refers to a copy of the size of the width of the writing that was set when the photo was attached.
- R200x0: In a format that allows images to be recalled by specifying horizontal widths, it is not adjustable to a larger size than the original image, and it is possible to create a flexible image size by moderately modifying the horizontal size.
- C480x270: Import images to a specified size, regardless of the original image size.
480x270, 500x500, 720x680, 750x680, 750x1000, 760x400, 760x470, 760x480, 1280x530, 1280x720

It acts like a file name for a practical image.
