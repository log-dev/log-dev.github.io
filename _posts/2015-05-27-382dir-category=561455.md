The executable files distributed on the Internet are somewhat unstable. Because it could be a file that someone posted with bad intentions. At this point, if the hash value of the file is an open executable, you can compare the hash value to see if it was modified by someone or not.

### Introducing HashTab

A tool that compares hash values for checking the integrity (or modulation) of a file. It works by being added to a file property window by a tab called File Hash.

The hash value is a value that is calculated by calculating the data in a file through a hash function or hash algorithm, which becomes a unique value for that file. Because the hash value is unique, the same hash value of two different files means that the two files are the same file that perfectly matches 100%.

It`s very easy to say that there`s a file with a value of 100 and the hash function is multiplied by 2. If you calculate these two, the hash value is 200. We calculated another file as the same hash function, and the hash value was 200 as well. That means that the file is also a file with a value of 100. In conclusion, both the first file and the second file are exactly the same files with the same data of 100.

File 1 hash value 200, file 2 hash value 200 -> File 1 and file 2 are exactly the same same file
File 1 Hash value 200, File 2 Hash value 300 -> File 1 and File 2 are completely different files

These hash values are usually provided by the distributor along with the file for the purpose of checking if the downloaded file is intact (or tampered with).

Common hash functions include CRC32, MD5, SHA-1, RIPEMD-128, and Tiger.

### Install HashTab

If you stop by the website and press the download button, you will ask for an email address. This is because HashTab distributes the download address by e-mail, and if you check the e-mail, it is as follows.

When an executable is installed, it is completed immediately without any specific settings.

### HashTab Usage

- Right-click File > Properties
- Select the File Hash tab and check the hash value you want
- Compare files to hash values raised by the provider

### HashTab Other Features

If you are a file provider, you can simply right-click to copy the hash value of the file, and you can also set the type of hash value that you want to output through the setup.
