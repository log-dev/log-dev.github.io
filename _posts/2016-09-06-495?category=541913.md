CSS Physician Class

Pseudo`s dictionary meaning means fake, but it is used as a "doctor, virtual" meaning in the document.
There are four types of CSS pseudo-classes:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2432984C57CF4EC61A)

### Link pseudo-class

Handling links based on selected history (e.g., links that you visit once have different colors)

- :link: If there is no history of href values
- :visited : If there is a history of href values
- :target: Target anchor

### Dynamic pseudo-class

- :active : When the target element is clicked (unlike JavaScript, it only applies while the mouse is actually pressed)
- :hover: When raising the mouse over the target element
- :focus : If the target element has focus

### Structural Physician Class

- :empty: Childless element
- :not(x) : Used to select elements except x element
- :first-child : first child element
- :last-child : Last element of that selector
- :only-child: Elements without siblings
- :only-of-type : Elements with unique types among siblings
- :nth-child(n) : nth child element
- :nth-of-type(n) : element of the nth type
- :nth-last-of-type(n) : the nth element calculated from the back of that type
- :first-of-type :first child element of a particular type
- :last-of-type : last child element of a particular type

Although the utilization rate is low due to the domestic environment, let`s focus on useful choices among those that are available directly in the future and on mobile.

:last-child

`:last-child` looks for the last child element as opposed to `:first-child`.

And the important thing is that you have to be a child.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="316" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/GqLNaj?height=316&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=GqLNaj&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_GqLNaj"></iframe>

:nth-child

The nth child selector is more flexible than the first or last choice.
That is, if you want to choose your fifth or eighth child, you can use `:nth-child(n)` to make your choice very easy.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="521" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/pbBRgk?height=521&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=pbBRgk&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_pbBRgk"></iframe>

:nth-of-type(n)

It should be noted that `:nth-of-type(n)` refers to a type, as the virtual class name also states.
In other words, type is called tag selector, but it can be confusing if you don`t understand what type means by tags.

Use the following examples to learn.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="515" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/wWkgmj?height=515&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=wWkgmj&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_wWkgmj"></iframe>

This `:nth-of-type(n)` may seem no different from `:nth-child(n)` when viewed as frozen.

However, the difference from the example code `:nth-child(n)` is that it filters only the type (tag).

This means that you choose the nth of the type (tag).

If you look at the markup above, the .demo class is declared in both p and ul types.
Therefore, `.demo:nth-of-type(2)` is the result of the above because it selects the 2nd of the p type or the 2nd of the ul type.

:nth-last-of-type(n)

If you have understood the virtual selectors so far, you will be able to understand `:nth-last-of-type(n)` this selector without difficulty.

This selector will select the nth element from the back of that particular type, as described above.

And the reason why there is no `:nth-first-of-type(n)` is that `:nth-of-type(n)` is found and selected from the front.

:first-of-type 과 :last-of-type

`:first-of-type`, `:last-of-type` This virtual selector is also used to select the first and last element of a particular type.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="560" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/bZJgJm?height=560&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=bZJgJm&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_bZJgJm"></iframe>

Finally, let`s learn about `:empty` and `:not(x)`.

:empty 와 :not(x)

`:empty` can be used to select content or childless elements and `:not(x)` can be used to select all elements except for x, where x means another selector.

To help you understand, let`s take a look at the code below.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="435" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/grymaj?height=435&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=grymaj&amp;default-tab=css&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_grymaj"></iframe>

Child and Brother Chooser

Child and brother combinator

Let`s take a quick look at these selectors.

### Child Combinator

CSS top-down declarations are useful, but sometimes they are unnecessary or unwanted.

For example, you may have experiences of canceling and reverting styles from nested, unordered lists.

What we can leverage here is a child combinator.

Take a quick look at the following example:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_6" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/xOZJBV?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=xOZJBV&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_6" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_xOZJBV"></iframe>

In the example above, the border of the nested ul was removed by defining `border: none;` in the nested ul.

If you do not want to use these top-down declarations and do not want to re-declare your style, you can use the following high-level knowledge combinator:

```css
div > ul {
border: 1px solid blue;
}
```

The child combinator, as shown above, helps you avoid unnecessary situations in top-down declarations.

Whether you want to use the child selector or the general top-down declaration, we recommend that you use it selectively based on your digin situation.

### Adjacent sibling combinator and generic sibling combiner

The adjacent Sibling Combinator is targeted at siblings immediately following an element.

In addition, the general sibling combinator selector is similar to the neighborhood combinator, but unlike the neighbor selector who targets the sibling that comes directly after the element, this selector can target any sibling that follows the element.

Let`s take a look at the following examples.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_7" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/zBQxpo?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=zBQxpo&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_7" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_zBQxpo"></iframe>
