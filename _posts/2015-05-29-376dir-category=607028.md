Try installing a test server that makes it easy for developers to use. Discover XAMPP, which has multiple server applications but can also be held as a portal.

### Introduction to XAMPP

XAMPP is the most popular PHP development environment. It is free, includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl, and is easy to install. It is a cross-platform support for both Windows, Linux, and Mac.

For portable XAMPP, you can download zip, 7zip, or portable files from SourceForge.

### XAMPP installation

As mentioned earlier, XAMPP is largely divided into full version installer versions and portable versions with minimal installation support, respectively, with separate versions of zip and 7z.

It includes the following and supports Windows 2008, 2012, Vista, 7 and 8 (notice XP and 2003).

Apache 2.4.12, MySQL 5.6.24, PHP 5.6.8, phpMyAdmin 4.3.11, OpenSSL 1.0.1, XAMPP Control Panel 3.2.1, Webalizer 2.23-04, Mercury Mail Transport System 4.63, FileZilla FTP Server 0.9.41, Tomcat 7.0.56 (with mod_proxy_ajp as connector), Strawberry Per

The installer installs the above items and registers control panels and services to control them.

- Run the installer. If the window`s UAC is turned on, the following warning message appears.
If the UAC is turned on, it is a statement to avoid installing it on C:\Program Files (x86), which I ignored.
- At the end of the installation, run the XAMPP control panel as an administrator to start Apache and what is needed.
- Select Allow access when the firewall is up.
- Enter http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 into the browser to verify that it is connected.

- Unzip the downloaded file from SourceForge where you want it.
- XAMPP is extracted as a `\xampp` subdirectory under the selected target directory.
- Run the setup_xampp.bat file to set up the XAMPP configuration on the system (for example, C:\xampp, D:\xampp) and setup_xampp.bat does not run, and you can run Apache or MySQL directly).
- The XAMPP control panel can be used for additional operations, such as the installer version.
- Run the XAMPP control panel as an administrator to start Apache and what is needed.
- Select Allow access when the firewall is up.
- Enter http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 into the browser to verify that it is connected.

If you are installing XAMPP on usb, it is recommended that you do not select an installation script and a relative path. This is because each PC can have a different drive letter. You can use the installation script to change from absolute to relative at any time.

XAMPP is a method for installing XAMPP in Portableapps applications.

- A zip or 7z version is recommended for downloading SourceForge. If you download the portable version among the versions, it only supports the minimum installation of APM, so let`s download the full version.
- Copy XAMPP to the root of the USB or storage media with portableapps installed.
- Launch portableapps` XAMPP control panel as administrator to start Apache and what is needed.
- Select Allow access when the firewall is up.
- Enter http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 into the browser to verify that it is connected.

### Remove XAMPP

- The installer version can be used as an uninstaller.
- If the Zip version has a module service installed, remove it using each module uninstall file and delete the remaining files.

### Move XAMPP Position

- If there is a Windows service for XAMPP control installed, remove it first and reinstall the service after moving.
- After moving the XAMPP directory to the desired location, run setup_xampp.bat to adjust the path of the configuration file.

### XAMPP Control Panel

Run the XAMPP Control Panel as an administrator.

- The Service column registers each module`s service with Windows Services.
Apache service uninstall: \xampp\apache\apache_uninstallservice.bat
Apache service uninstall: \xampp\apache\apache_uninstallservice.bat
MySQL service install: \xampp\mysql\mysql_installservice.bat
MySQL service uninstall: \xampp\mysql\mysql_uninstallservice.bat
FileZilla service (un)install: \xampp\filezilla_setup.bat
Mercury: No service installation available
- Apache service uninstall: \xampp\apache\apache_uninstallservice.bat
- Apache service uninstall: \xampp\apache\apache_uninstallservice.bat
- MySQL service install: \xampp\mysql\mysql_installservice.bat
- MySQL service uninstall: \xampp\mysql\mysql_uninstallservice.bat
- FileZilla service (un)install: \xampp\filezilla_setup.bat
- Mercury: No service installation available
- The Module column lists the names of the modules.
- The PID(s) column is the execution number of the module.
- The Port(s) column lists the port numbers on which each module runs.
- Actions invoke each function by executing the given button.
Start/Stop: Controls the start and stop of the module.
Admin
Apache : brings up the http://localhost, or XAMPP settings page.
MySQL : brings up phpMyAdmin.
Config : Recalls each setup file.
Log: Load each log file.

The Editor is connected to a notepad, but it is not UTF-8, so it is opened with a vicious character. Let`s use it by connecting it with the editor we use.

Sets the module to be automatically started when the XAMPP control panel is running.

Use if port change is required.

| Module | Port Number | Description |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ftp | 21/tcp | File Transfer Control (XAMPP: FTP Default Port) |
| smtp | 25/tcp | mail # Simple Mail Transfer (XAMPP: SMTP Default Port) |
| http | 80/tcp | World Wide Web HTTP (XAMPP: Apache Default Port) |
| pop3 | 110/tcp | Post Office Protocol - Version 3 (XAMPP: POP3 Default Port) |
| imap | 143/tcp | Internet Message Access Protocol (XAMPP: IMAP Default Port) |
| https | 443/tcp | http protocol over TLS/SSL (XAMPP: Apache SSL Port) |
| mysql | 3306/tcp | MySQL (XAMPP: MySQL Default Port) |
| AJP/1.3 | 8009 | AJP/1.3 (XAMPP: Tomcat AJP/1.3 Port) |
| http-alt | 8080/tcp | HTTP Alternate (see port 80) (XAMPP: Tomcat Default Port) |

If you encounter problems with the port, xampp-portcheck.Try using exe.

### XAMPP Security Settings

Basically, XAMPP is a platform for development and is not suitable for server operation for real-world services. XAMPP is vulnerable to security because it can be accessed by an internal LAN from an external network.

With the upgrade of XAMPP, the security page no longer exists.

- Connect to http://localhost/security/.
- Connects to http://localhost/security/xamppsecurity.php in the middle of the document.
- Set passwords for MySQL root users and phpMyAdmin.
- Encrypt XAMPP directory (where the current setup pages exist)

When you access the Security page again, you will be notified in green that XAMPP access rights, MySQL administrator registration, and phpMyAdmin password have been activated.
