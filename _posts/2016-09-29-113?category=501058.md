### utility of the effective range

The two examples below show the difference between using variable i as a regional variable and using it as a global variable.

Global variables cause unintended problems by changing the value of variables with the same name used by different logic.

Using variables of the same name but having different intentions results in unintended consequences such as the above.

The above code is easy to recognize because we are short, but if it is a code with a large amount of code, it becomes very difficult to find a problem.

The concept introduced to solve and mitigate these problems is the effective range of global variables, local variables, in the history of programming.

It is said that the definition of variables was very careful because there was no such scope of validity from the beginning.

In other words, global variables, local variables, are in the same context that they are not overwritten even if the same file name exists in different directories.

### When using global variables inevitably

When it is inevitable to use global variables, we use a method to make one object a global variable and manage variables with the properties of the object. This is a method (pattern) devised by Douglas Krocford.

Generating as a member of a global variable object significantly reduces the risk of conflicting names of variables.

If you do not want to use a global variable, you can use it by invoking an anonymous function as shown above, which is a common way to modularize logic.

The jQuery library also takes this form.

### Static Validity

JavaScript has a valid range at the time the function is declared (defined).

This method of validation is called static scoping, or lexical scoping. (Vocabulary Validity Range)

Lexical is a concept related to closures.

The value of i in console.log(i) initially finds i inside the b function. If i don`t exist, we`re looking for a global variable.

Does b() refer to i inside the a function at the time it is called?

Or does the function b with console.log(i) refer to the global variable i at the time it was declared?

The result is to find 5 of the global variable.

The reason is that without an internal i, the b function will find the global variable at the declared, defined point in time... The code above does not use the internal variable i in the a function declaration containing b().

In other words, a function refers to a variable when it is defined or declared, not when it is used or called.

These are called static effective ranges, lexical (vocabulary effective ranges).

b() From whom (from which function) the call will be called I don`t know if it will be used.

It can be used inside a function or called inside another function.

Depending on the target used, code that can access the variable it has is a dynamic valid range, but if the function b refers to a variable at a defined point in time, it is called static valid range, lexical because it has the same result.

It may not be a big problem with simple code, but when you encounter problems that you don`t understand in the process of increasing the amount of code,

Such problems often arise with this scope of validity, so be sure to understand and move on with these concepts.
