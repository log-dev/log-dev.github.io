4 Ways to Prevent Event Forwarding

The event model traverses the structure of the DOM twice.

When an event is called, a capture step takes place from the top root to the target of the event with child elements, and in contrast, a bubble step takes place from the target of the event to the top root.

This event propagation process sometimes results in unexpected results, for example, when you create a click event on both the parent element and the child element and click on the child element to call the event, the click occurs on the parent element that you did not click on.

This unintended reaction causes problems because events occur during the bubbleing phase during the propagation process of the event model.

However, you can prevent this step from progressing by invoking the stopPropagation() method on the event object.

A summary of the methods used to abort an event is shown below.

### What is event propagation?!

Before we look at the above methods, let`s take a look at the following examples of what events are propagated and communicated.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="450" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/KdWdbr?height=450&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=KdWdbr&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_KdWdbr"></iframe>

When you click on each area in the results pane above, the results that appear in the results console appear.

When you click on the highest parent DIV, you can only click on DIV, but if you click on the lowest child span, you can see that it includes not only the span, but also the click events in p and div.

This is what the event spreads and delivers.

These are the three codes that are used to block the forwarding of these events.

### event.stopPropagation() - blocks event propagation

stopPropagation() is a code that prevents events from passing, propagating, to the parent DOM.

The following example adds the event.stopPropagation() method to the span-clack event to prevent the event from being passed to the parent DOM.

The result is that if you click span, only span events will work, but when you click p, both p and div will be called.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="499" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/meWeow?height=499&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=meWeow&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_meWeow"></iframe>

### event.preventDefault() - Method to block the default behavior of events

You can see that the following example performs the event action on tag a, but also performs the function of moving the URL, which is the original purpose of tag a.

In other words, we are also performing basic action events with tag a as well as event actions.

The event.stopPropagation() method only blocks the forwarding of events, but does not prevent the default behavior of moving URLs.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="396" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/KdWdYb?height=396&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=KdWdYb&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_KdWdYb"></iframe>

In the following example, instead of the stopPropagation() method, we will change it to the preventDefault() method to run it.

If you check the behavior, you can see that the basic functional behavior of tag a is not executed.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="435" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/PPpPvE?height=435&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=PPpPvE&amp;default-tab=js&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_PPpPvE"></iframe>

When you are working on a project, you usually need to use two codes: stopPropaging() and preventDefault() when you want to perform only the event actions you want in the DOM.

However, if used within the jquery code in performing the event behavior, you can use return false to produce the same results as you did two of these methods.

### stopImmediatePropagation() - blocks propagation to other events that have the same DOM

The stopPropagation() method discussed earlier is a code that blocks the event from forwarding to the parent DOM.

So what if there were several events hanging on the DOM?!

The following example adds the stopPropagation() method to the span click event to block the parent propagation.

The difference is that we gave two click events to span.

If we put several events in one DOM area like this, how will stop Popagation work?

The result is that when you click span, events are not passed until p, div, but both events caught in span work.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="504" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/wKJKVX?height=504&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=wKJKVX&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_wKJKVX"></iframe>

The following code will use stopImmediatePropagation() instead of stopPropagation() for the first of the two events in span:

If you check the results, you can see that both events on the span were called and operated in the previous code, but the current code immediately stopped propagating and only the first event was called and operated.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="499" width="100%" name="cp_embed_6" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/GpWoKO?height=499&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=GpWoKO&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_6" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_GpWoKO"></iframe>

### event capture

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="411" width="100%" name="cp_embed_7" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/gaeovZ?height=411&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=gaeovZ&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_7" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_gaeovZ"></iframe>

### event bubble

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="405" width="100%" name="cp_embed_8" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/QjmarW?height=405&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=QjmarW&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_8" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_QjmarW"></iframe>
