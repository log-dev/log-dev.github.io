Use Piwik to learn about the good things and some settings.

### Changing dashboard layout

After installing Piwik, the first page is the Dashboard page. The layout of the dashboard is basically a three-column screen that shows widgets sorted, but there is no ability to adjust the size of each widget, so this layout can be changed to further expand the size of the widget.

Widgets and dashboards for dashboards ▼ > Manage Dashboards ↓ - Change the layout of dashboards allows you to change the layout.

### Optimize and Scale Piwik

(Piwik optimization based on server size)

Piwik can serve millions of pages on medium and large sites, but it is very efficient to run on a small scale, such as web hosting.

* Select server based on page view

- If the daily page view is less than 1,000 pages, it works in general web hosting.
- If the daily page view is less than 10,000 pages, a fast-paced webhosting or virtual server should be established.
- If the daily page view is more than 10,000 pages, a dedicated hosting or virtual server must be established.

### How to Set up Auto-Archiving of Your Reoports

(Automatic Storage Method)

If a website is accessed by more than a few hundred visitors a day, it may take several minutes to process the data with Piwik. This will load the server, so to avoid this processing time, let`s set the cron job to automatically process the data every hour (Piwik`s default is the Real-time method of processing the data upon request).

Setup requires the installation of php-cli or php-cgi.

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-cli

```

Crontab settings

```bash
sudo crontab -e

MAILTO="youremail@example.com"
5 * * * * www-data /usr/bin/php5 /var/www/example.com/piwik/misc/cron/archive.php -- url=http://example.org/piwik/ > /var/www/example.com/logs/piwik-archive.log

```

If an error occurs during cron operation, send an error message to the e-mail address.

Web server execution user (www-data in Ubuntu)

It may vary depending on the execution pass and installation method of php. Find the pass with which php5 command.

The place to store the created logs. If specified as /dev/null, no log is recorded.

```bash
su www-data -c "/usr/bin/php5 /var/www/example.com/piwik/misc/cron/archive.php -- url=http://example.org/piwik/"

```

Login as a piwik superuser > Settings > General Settings

Allow Piwik archiving to trigger when reports are viewed from the browser: No로 설정

Reports for today will be processed at most every: 3600 seconds 로 설정

If an error occurs, such as Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 16777216 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate X bytes), the PHP memory should be increased.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/php5/cli/php.ini

memory_limit = 512M

```

```bash
sudo vi /etc/php5/apache/php.ini

memory_limit = 512M

```

### Data Limits in Piwik

(Data Restriction)

In Piwik, the limitation of data storage is the free space on the server/hard disk.

Piwik uses only 1,000 lines as default and cuts the rest for performance reasons. The setup file can be modified to store 100% of the data.

The default values are set, such as the top 500 pages, top 1,000 keywords, top 1,000 websites, etc. Pwiki summarizes all remaining pages, keywords, etc. in "Other".

You can release this limit by setting the value of the config/config.ini.php file if you want all the data or more than the current limited row. The following is a method that limits all tables to 5,000 entries.

```undefined
[General]
; maximum number of rows for any of the Referers tables (keywords, search engines, campaigns, etc.), and Custom variables names
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_referers = 5000

; maximum number of rows for any of the Referers subtable (search engines by keyword, keyword by campaign, etc.), and Custom variables values
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_subtable_referers = 5000

; maximum number of rows for any of the Actions tables (pages, downloads, outlinks)
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_actions = 5000

; maximum number of rows for pages in categories (sub pages, when clicking on the + for a page category)
datatable_archiving_maximum_rows_subtable_actions = 5000

```

We can track up to five user variables per visit or up to five user variables per page view.

Custom variables are useful for tracking detailed metadata about pages, events, or visitors.

- Unique user-defined variable names and values can be tracked indefinitely.
- Each name or value is limited to 200 characters in length.
- By default, Pwiki handles the top 100 user-defined variables and aggregates the rest under "Other". This will keep the report size small and process the report efficiently.

Custom Variables: http://piwik.org/docs/custom-variables/#toc-data-limits-for-custom-variables

There is no limit to the number of goals that can be tracked.

There is no limit to the number of transactions that can be recorded per day.

There is no limit to the number of scheduled reports.

There is no limit.

There is no limit.

There is only one superuser`s limitation, and there is no limit to the general user account.

There is no limit to the number of records to be exported.

There is no limitation. Data is basically forever maintained, but user decisions can set the retention period for data.

### Piwik Server Security

- Separate the piwik installation DB and other DBs. (Webhosting may not be possible, but...
- Create and use a new user for piwik DB. (Only the piwik DB will be robbed.)
- It always serves piwik on https://(SSL) (encryption transfer such as login information, password, token_auth). When set as below, the request of http is automatically redirected to https.
BASH
`sudo vi config/config.ini.php

[General]
force_ssl=1
`
- Restrict access to piwik using .htaccess. Use .htpasswd or IP address (forum.piwik.org/read.php?6,17251).
- Piwik provides automatic updates. Use this.
- Use the piwik SecurityInfo plug-in.
- Use SFTP or SSH.
- Respect the user privacy.

### Web Analystics Privacy in Piwik

(Private Web Analysis)

Piwik protects the privacy of user and analytical data. The data is stored in MySQL and is not sent elsewhere.

You can set the relevant settings in Setting > Privacy.

By default, piwik stores the visitor`s IP address. To anonymize a visitor`s IP, enable (Yes) Anonymous Visitors` IP address in Setting > Privacy and specify the unit of IP address to mask.

Clearing already processed logs saves DB space, improves performance, and protects privacy.

It is recommended to keep logs for 3 to 6 months and delete subsequent ones. If log deletion is enabled, unprocessed (not connected) logs will be deleted and should be noted. If you set up automatic storage, it is already processed, so there is no worry.

Setting(설정) > Privacy > Delete old visitor logs from database = Yes

Setting(설정) > Privacy > Piwik opt-out for your visitors

Copy the iframe and post it on the website.

If tracking is disabled in a web browser, we respect it and do not track visitor information.

Piwik uses cookies to track visitors, and some countries prohibit it legally.

In the pasting JavaScript code, add the following:

```js
'paq.push(['disableCookies'); // add this part
paq.push(['trackPageView'];

```
