Wordpress has a function called permailink. This is closely related to the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of the site, which is based on most CMS tools in recent years.

### What is Permalink?

If you look at the address box of a site, you can find characters (parameters) that are not known to mean something like `http://exampl.com/?p=12`. This is a form of recall of texts stored by established rules, but it is a machine-understood language, not a human-understandable part. In order for humans to understand, we need to clarify what it refers to and it is Permalink that emerged to do so.

What about an address like http://example.com/how-to-wordpress-install?

It can be understood by humans as much as how to install WordPress. In addition, search engines can naturally increase their search ranking compared to sites that do not have permalink applied to them, associated with the address of the site and the title of the article that will be used in the search algorithm.

Permalink gives the posts a permanent URL according to the set format. Using this, we create a link that gives the above meaning, which is not actually a URL that exists in the server`s directory structure, but is a virtual URL, so we can create a structure to sort the posts at any time.

### Permalink setup and utilization examples

Set in Settings > Permalinks.

Basically, you can choose permalink as shown below and edit it to your taste using Custom Structure.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/267A7B33524475A508)

Example) Daily updated newspaper articles are separately serviced.

구조 : /%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%post_id%/
Address: http://example.com/2013/09/27/ Chosun Ilbo

Example) It is distinguished using developers and development items on an open source sharing site.

구조 : /%author%/%postname%/
Address: http://example.com/unclepapa/wordpress-plugin

Case) WordPress tips and plug-ins are divided into several categories to provide information.

구조 : /%category%/%postname%/
Address: http://example.com/plugins/seo-plugin

As shown above, permalink should be considered according to the nature of the site. Below is a description of the tags that can be used in Custom Structure.

- %year%: Year of Writing, 2013
- The month of writing, 09
- %day%: Writing Day, 27
- %hour%: Writing Time, 03
- %minute% : Written in minutes, 22
- %second%: Written Seconds, 33
- %post_id% : Unique number automatically assigned to each article, 12
- %postname% : Title of post and page, replace space with `-` (hyphen), wordpress-permalinks
- %category% : category that saved the text, how to
- %author%: author`s name, unclepapa

You can set the Category base and Tag base with the optional above.

Category base is the parent concept of a category, and if the category name is wordpress and the category base is CMS, the address is http://example.org/CMS/wordpress/. If nothing is entered, `category` is used as the default. In the case of Tag, `tag` is used as the default if it is not entered.

If the site does not have a single category base or if you want to remove it altogether, you can install the plug-in below to solve it. All you need to do is activate the plug-in without any other settings.

### Take advantage of Slug

If permalink is set to the same format as %postname%, the longer the title of the document is, often, resulting in an extremely long femalink. This is neither good nor short to look at, so use slugs on the editing screen to fix it short.

As shown in the picture below, the title of the article is Hello!, but you can use Edit Unique Address below (this is Slug) to enter what you want instead of the title of the article.

Tips for creating an optimal unique address are as follows.

- Short ones are better.
- Maintain the appropriate URL structure throughout the site.
- Make a slug so that you can remember the post.

### Points to note when changing Permalink

If you change the permalink that you used before, you will see a 404 error if you use the link before the previous visitor (search engine, visitor, etc.) changes because the already known link changes. As a result, it is recommended to think of a definite permalink structure in the red pepper paste and not change it afterwards.

If Permalink is changed, there is a way to redirect it to an existing address. There is a detailed description of the link below.
