JavaScript Method Override

Inheritance using constructor functions (classes) can often result in the need to override the inherited parent`s function without using it as it is.

This case is called method override, and this article will learn how to override JavaScript.

And lastly, we briefly introduce overloading.

### What is method override?

A method override is a feature used to override the parent class`s function (method) in the child class.

Overlides are often used in the following situations:

- You want to use the features implemented by your child class without using the features of the parent class.
- You want to extend the capabilities of the parent class in the child class.

So let`s get to know more about these two cases.

Override features of parent class in child class

Overriding (overriding) features of a parent class is simple.

Like the grammar above, you can make the functions of the parent class that you want to override (override) with the same name in the child class.

Take a look at the following examples:

```js
// Parent Class
function MyParent() {
this.property1 = 'data1';
console.log('MyParent');
}

MyParent.prototype.method1 = function () {
console.log('property1 = ' + this.property1);
};

// Child Class
function MyChild() {
console.log('MyChild');
}

// Inherit parent
MyChild.prototype = new MyParent();
// Set constructor
MyChild.prototype.constructor = MyChild;

/**
* ------------------
* Method override
* ------------------
**/
MyChild.prototype.method1 = function () {
console.log('Property 1 is = ' + this.property1 +');
};

// Create Child Instance
var child = new MyChild();
// method call
child.method1();


// Console Window Results
// MyParent
// MyChild
// Property 1 is = data1.
```

By executing the above code, you will no longer see the `method1()` method of the parent class working and the `method1()` method created in the child class working.

This method override is used to override the parent`s function without modifying the parent`s function directly.

Extending features of a parent class from a child class

In the course of practical work, there are times when you want to add a little bit of function while using the function of the parent, rather than redefining the function of the parent entirely.

In this case, method override can be this case.

```js
MyChild.prototype.부모메서드 = function ([param1, param2, ...]) {
Parent class.prototype.parent method.call(this[,param1,param2,...])

// Additional Extended Syntax
}
```

The default is to make the function (method) of the parent class you want to override the function (method) with the same name in the child class.

Subsequently, the `call()` method provided by the function object (Fucntion) is used to invoke the parent`s function.

You can write the next phrase you want to add.

To help you understand, take a look at an example of feature scaling using override.

```js
// Parent Class
function MyParent() {
this.property1 = 'string data';
console.log('MyParent()');
}

MyParent.prototype.info = function () {
console.log('property1 = ' + this.property1);
};

// Child Class
function MyChild() {
console.log('MyChild()');
this.property2 = 'data length';
}

// inherit parent class
MyChild.prototype = new MyParent();
// Set constructor
MyChild.prototype.constructor = MyChild;

/**
* -----------------------------------
* Extend capabilities using method override
* -----------------------------------
**/
MyChild.prototype.info = function () {/override the info() method, which is a feature to be extended, in the child class.
Call the info() method of the parent class using MyParent.prototype.info.call(this); //call().
console.log ('Property 2' + this.property2); // add the functionality you want to expand.
};

// Create Child Instance
var child1 = new MyChild();

// output child information
child1.info(); // 'Property second is data length' output.
```

As shown above, method override allows you to extend the functionality of the parent.

### Overloading methods from JavaScript

Method overloading is a feature that creates multiple methods with the same name and then automatically invokes the method that matches the parameter type and number.

Unfortunately, however, JavaScript does not provide overloading grammatically.

Instead, you can use the constructor function to mimic the class of a general object-oriented language, as well as the overloading.

Syntax

```js
'function function or method name () {
leverage arguments object
}
```

In JavaScript, you can mimic overloading using parameters that contain parameter information.

Overloading can be used equally in functions and methods.

Use the following example to learn more.

This example is a function that adds multiple numeric values.

```js
function sum() {
var result = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
result += arguments[i];
}
return result;
}

console.log(sum(10, 20)); // 30
console.log(sum(10, 20, 30)); // 60
console.log(sum(10, 20, 30, 40)); // 100
console.log(sum(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)); // 150
```

The parameter values contained in the `arguments` object are repeatedly added by the number of parameters.

Overloading will be especially useful when you create your own library.
