JavaScript Overview

In 1995, JavaScript was introduced by Brandon Ike of Netscape (a commercially successful web browser).

JavaScript plays a complex role in interacting with users dynamically with static documents.

At first, JavaScript was in a fence called the Web, and in a bad way, it was in a prison called the Web.

When JavaScript first appeared, it could only work on the web.

In an era when the web environment was not as important as it is now, JavaScript was not as useful or valuable as it is now.

The philosophy of creating JavaScript was based on making it a language that anyone could easily access and develop, so professional developers considered it too lacking compared to other languages, and the developers were cold-hearted and despised.

There was an incident where the perspective of JavaScript began to change, and in 2004, the GMAIL service created by Google was announced.

This Gmail was a web application made only with pure web technology, and it was very functional, and at the heart of it was JavaScript.

From then on, developers gradually began to be interested, and after that, Google opened Google Maps, a map service, again.

This Google Maps service huge data containing all the topography in the world through the web with pure web technology, and many developers realize once again a big change.

From this point on, JavaScript begins to be re-illuminated.

And another big incident happened in 2008 by Google, which announced the Google Chrome web browser and developed its own JavaScript engine to boost its performance, which is called the V8 engine.

And Google releases the source that developed this engine as an open source.

It`s very difficult to make this `V8 engine`, but Google`s open-source release opens the way for many developers to bring it and use it to program their systems with JavaScript.

Since then, JavaScript has become a turning point where it is used outside the web.

In other words, the technology called JavaScript is not limited to the web, but it is accelerating the de-webbing phenomenon.

Since then, JavaScript has been successful and is enjoying the heyday of JavaScript until now, and it is a popular language that continues to be ranked in the top 5 of the development languages.

### Browser and JavaScript

In the `Model-View-Controller` structure, HTML handles the data `Model` and CSS handles the `View` that constitutes the screen, and finally JavaScript acts as a `Controller` in the small world of browsers.

The meaning of the word script in JavaScript means a manuscript used in a movie or speech.

The original word script means a play script.

In other words, it is about how a speaker or actor should do in a certain scene.

The receiving the script, script as they watch the people how to behave these actions will determine to interpretation (interpreter).Expression.

In this sense, scripting languages have the same meaning as scripts to direct work.

If you think of JavaScript in this sense, it`s a statement of work (transcript) that you ask a browser to express HTML documents.

Each browser has its own JavaScript interpreter, which is used to interpret JavaScript declared in HTML or processed as a link.

HTML uses the tag `script` to instruct the browser to handle this part separately because it contains a script.

### When to execute JavaScript

When the browser encounters HTML data, it parses using an HTML parser.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Title</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
<script src="example.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<img src="/images/sample.png" alt="">

<script>
alert('Output the warning window.');
</script>

<ul>
Parsing <li>HTML</li>
>Load external CSS files and external JavaScript files</li>
<li>Run when JavaScript is delivered</li>
<li>DOM tree is deployed</li>
Load external resources such as >image files and flash</li
<li>All done</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
```

What`s important here is that HTML data is organized into a DOM tree and processed later, while the content of the `script` tag is interpreted (immediately) and executed.

Before displaying the alert window `alert()` in the code above, the browser will then request a JavaScript interpreter (or JavaScript engine), one of the components within the browser, to process the tag `alert().

The JavaScript engine interprets this content and executes it immediately.

It is necessary to pay attention to what you expressed as immediate.

The data created from the back will be loaded afterwards, because all DOM trees are configured to run immediately rather than when they are complete.

### Why put the JavaScript code at the end of the document?

Although it is still common to place JavaScript at the top of HTML, such as CSS, sometimes you can see that JavaScript code is located at the bottom of the HTML document.

JavaScript itself works by stopping and processing all operations, so if possible, you can run the DOM tree as much as possible, and then run and operate JavaScript.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>When to run JavaScript</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
<img src="/images/sample.png" alt="">

<ul>
Parsing <li>HTML</li>
>Load external CSS files and external JavaScript files</li>
<li>Run when JavaScript is delivered</li>
<li>DOM tree is deployed</li>
Load external resources such as >image files and flash</li
<li>All done</li>
</ul>

<script src="script-01.js"></script>
<script src="script-02.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### What is jQuery, a library of JavaScript?

- jQuery founder John Resig distributed the first version in 2006
- Start by worrying about how Javascript can be easily accessed
- Departed from one of several JavaScript libraries
(Library is a warehouse of code that combines frequently used or difficult-to-deploy features)

Learn the Athletes to Study jQuery

- HTML/CSS
- javaScript Core
- DOM(Document Object Model)

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>alert
```

### Deburgging - console, alert

Debugging in the computer field is the process of finding and correcting bugs, or avoiding errors, in a computer program or hardware device.

To eliminate program or hardware device defects, you must remove the problem and correct it. If a program has been debugged or fixed a program`s fault, it means that there is no more error.

In other words, it`s about fixing the program`s bugs.(Debugging means solving bugs)

A bug refers to a malfunction in a program, even if it`s a long program, it`s basically good to put a breakpoint on the suspected code part and run it little by little to see if a lot of different values come out right, but it might be more efficient to create a bug from the beginning.

If the wrong variable goes over to an argument, it`s either a return value or two or more algorithms, such as an important function, to compare the calculations with each other. This debugging should only be based on practice and experience.

alert

It`s a simple way to write an `alert` statement in JavaScript.

This will display the alert dialog box when you open the web browser. JavaScript version of debugging using so-called print.

This method is available in any web browser. In addition, all JavaScript will stop running while the alert dialog is displayed.

Therefore, `alert` can be written in large quantities, such as phased execution is possible.

However, it is not a very convenient way to close the `alert` dialog (warning window) one by one.

Moreover, if you run `alert` in an infinite loop by mistake, you will not be able to close the window if you cannot terminate the process in the web browser.

console

Today`s web browsers have a standard console feature for running JavaScript.

Originally, it was a function implemented in Fireburg, an add-on for Firefox, but as more developers use Fireburg, it is standard for safari and Google Chrome.

When you write a code in a JavaScript, such as `console.log(`using console object`);`, the console displays "Use console object."

It is essentially the same as using `alert`, but using `console` is better to use than `alert` because you do not need to close each dialog box.

You can also display more detailed data than notifications.

However, please be aware that there will be errors in browsers (without console objects) that do not exist in standards such as Internet Explorer (IE is only supported on 8+ and above).

### Variable

Variables serve to store and include any value. That is, memory space (a bowl for data) that can store changing data (values).

The variable is used by the user by defining the name and can be used to read the stored or embedded value through the name that the user defines.

You can also store or include other values in declared variables to disappear and replace them with new values.

Declare Variables

When declaring a variable, you can put the var keyword before the variable name, specify the variable name as any word, and specify the variable name as a mixture of English, numbers, and some special characters ($,_).

However, you cannot declare the first letter as a number and usually use camel notation to start with a lowercase letter and add a capital alphabet in the middle of the word to increase the legibility of the word.

- Storage that stores a value continuously so that it can be used whenever needed
- Values in variable names can be changed at any time
- javascript No internally pre-used keywords or reservations
- Variable name first letter can be used as a special symbol (underscore, $)

```js
var i;
i = 10;
// stored 10 in variable i

var str = "abc";
// Store the string "abc" in the variable name str'
```

Defines a value in a variable, which is expressed as assigning a value to a variable.

The above code assigns a value of 10 to the pre-declared variable i, so the value of variable i is 10.

And before you assign a value of 10, the value of undefined is assigned as the initial value.

The substitution of a value for str is the assignment of a value at the same time as declaring a declaration.

Scope of variable (scope)

In JavaScript, the scope of the variable is determined by the function, and each variable is either a global variable or a region variable.

Global variables can be accessed from anywhere, but local variables can only be accessed within the scope on which the variable is declared.

Function is the only block that can define the scope of a variable in JavaScript.

In other words, local variables are declared within the function, while global variables are declared outside the function.

This law is unconditional!!!

```js
var a = 1111;
console.log(a); // global variable affecting the entire region

function outer() {

vara = 222; // only affects the inside of the function as a region variable because it is declared inside the function
console.log(a);

function inner() {
var a;
console.log(a);
}
inner();
}
outer();

console.log(a);
```

- To clarify the range of variables, it is recommended to declare `var` (do not use `var` for regional variables depending on the code)
- Variables declared through `var` are recognized as regional variables, but variables that do not use `var` are recognized as global variables.

### Default type and reference type of variable

There are two types of variables: basic type and reference type.

The default type (type) is also called the data type, and the reference type can assign one value to multiple variables, although the value of the base type is unique to itself.

In other words, if the reference type has the same value, it can affect other places if modified in one place.

The following table is organized by separating the basic type and the reference type.

Type of Default Type

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

Type of Reference Type

Properties of Base Type and Reference Type

```js
* ======================================+
* Characteristics of the base type (compare the values of the memory number)
* ======================================+
var a = 20;
var b = 20;
console.log(a == b); // The base type compares the value itself, even though the memory number is different.

var c = 100;
var d = c;
console.log(c, d);

d = 50;
console.log(c, d); // values of c are preserved because they have values in different memory ranges.



* ==================================+
* Properties of reference type (compare memory number)
* ==================================+

var obj1 = {a: 1};
var obj2 = {a: 1};
console.log (obj1 == obj2); // false outputs because memory bungee is compared

var obj3 = {b: 30};
var obj4 = obj3;
obj4.b = 50;
console.log(obj3.b, obj4.b); // also changes obj.3 because it points to the same memory number.
```

In almost all books, the base type compares the value itself and the reference type compares the reference.

Characterized Data

String data is created by wrapping letters or numbers in double quotes or single quotes.

```js
var str = 'javaScript';
var num = "100";
```

Numeric Data

Numeric data must contain only numbers of data stored in variables.

```js
var num = 100;
varnum2 = Number ("200"); // Converts characterized data to numeric and convert to numeric 200.
```

Logical data

The Boolean data has true or false data, which is usually the result of comparing two data.

For example, "10 is greater than 100" is an incorrect comparison and returns a result called false.

The basic types of logical data are as follows:

```js
vara = true; // store true in variable a
var b = (100 = 10); // variable b stores false due to computed result'
```

null

`undefined` refers to when no value is registered in a variable, and `null` refers to when `null` is stored as data in a variable.

`null` means that a value is stored but has no meaning (sometimes used to empty the data stored in a variable).
