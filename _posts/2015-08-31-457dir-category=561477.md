I translated answers to frequently asked questions when using boiler plates.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- Why is it not set to automatically load the latest version of jQuery via Google CDN?
- Google recommends placing Google Analytics at the bottom of the page when Google recommends placing it at the `head` part.
- How can the bootstrap and boiler play be integrated?
- Should the boiler plate be upgraded every time a new version is released?
- Where can I get help with questions?

Recently, the lastes version of CDN was discontinued. As a result, jQuery announced that the use of the "jquery-latest.js" version, which had a chronic problem, should be prohibited from being used on actual service-level web pages. (Don`t Use jquery-latest.js)

Google CDN is no longer updated, and locks are maintained in version 1.11.1 to prevent accidental web breakage.

In general, updating the version should be a planned decision-making. You should not include a latest version of the URL as in the past (the latest version will no longer be updated) and you should be allowed to select the version you want. Otherwise:

- It may not be compatible with existing plug-ins/code on the site.
- Users cannot benefit from long-term caching, only guaranteeing a very short cache lifetime when compared to the choice of a particular version.

The main benefit of placing it in the "head" section is that visitors can measure it with a visitor`s page view even if they leave the page before it is fully loaded. However, placing code at the bottom of the page helps improve performance (fast page viewing).

One simple method is to use Initalizr to create custom builds that contain both boiler plates and bootstraps.

Let`s find out more about the complementary method of boiler plate and bootstrap.

If you are going to replace the basic structure of the page, you do not have to do so. However, if you want to reflect recent changes, you should assess and implement costs and benefits.
