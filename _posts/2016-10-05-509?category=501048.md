Prototype Chain

JavaScript automatically creates a property called `prototype` in the `Function()` instance.

Specifically, the `prototype` property is linked to an object created using the `new` keyword and the `generator function`.

Instances share and inherit common methods and attributes through the prototype property of the constructor function.

The important thing is that these shares occur while retrieving properties.

In other words, when you find or access an object`s properties, JavaScript looks for them not only on that object but also on the prototype chain.

### The functions all contain prototype objects.

Even functions that you do not intend to use as constructor functions automatically include prototype objects.

The following code uses the `Array()` constructor to create an array and then invoke the join() method of the array:

```js
var myArr = new Array('foo', 'bar');

console.log (myArr.join()); // foo,bar is recorded.
```

The `join()` method is an attribute that is not defined in myArr object instance.

However, the user was able to use the join() method as if it had existed.

I`m sure this method is defined somewhere.

But where is it? This method is defined as a property in the prototype property of the Array() constructor.

Because there is no join() method in an array object instance, JavaScript searches the prototype chain for a method called join().

Why did they make it work this way?

In fact, this is a matter of efficiency and reuse.

Is it necessary to add the join() method, which always works the same way for each instance of the array constructor function?

It would be more reasonable to import one join() method from every array than to create a new function for every instance of the array.

JavaScript achieves this efficiency through prototype properties, prototype linkages, and prototype chain discovery.

Why is the prototype property important?!

The native constructor functions (such as Object(), Array(), Function(), and so on) use the prototype property to allow the constructor instance to inherit the methods and properties.

JavaScript uses these mechanisms to help object instances inherit the prototype property of the constructor function.

Therefore, to better understand JavaScript, you need to know how JavaScript uses prototype objects.

When creating a custom constructor function, prototype inheritance can be implemented in the same way as JavaScript native objects.

However, it must be accompanied by an understanding of the way inheritance is achieved.

You may dislike prototype inheritance or prefer other inheritance patterns, but realistically speaking, someone will probably have to modify or manipulate code implemented using prototype inheritance.

At this point, you need to know how prototype inheritance works so that you can replicate the functions of the constructor functions created by other developers.

You can use prototype inheritance to create multiple efficient object instances that share the same method.

As mentioned earlier, array objects, which are instances of Array() constructors, do not necessarily have to add the join() method to each instance.

The prototype chain of all array instances stores the join() method, so all array instances can use the same join() method.

### Every Function() instance has a prototype property.

In JavaScript, functions are created from the Mode Function() constructor, whether created by calling the Function() constructor directly or by using literal notation.

When you create a function instance, the instance is always added to the prototype property.

The prototype property itself is the same as an empty object.

After defining a function named myFn in the following code, try accessing the prototype property of this function.

```js
var myFn = function () {

};
console.log (myFn.prototype); // Object() is recorded.
console.log(typeof myFn.prototype); // 'object' 가 기록된다.
```

The prototype property, which is set automatically at any time because of the use of the `Function()` constructor, is an important property and should be well understood.

Although there is only one user-defined function used as a constructor in the code above, the Function() constructor grants the prototype property to all function instances of the function()

### The prototype property is an Object() object.

The information about the prototype is a little difficult.

Technically, when creating a Function() instance, prototype is only a property whose default value is an empty object named `prototype` by JavaScript.

If you code it yourself, you can write it as follows:

```js
var myFunc = function () {

};

myFunc.prototype = {}; // The demonstrator adds the prototype property himself and assigns an empty object to the attribute value.
console.log (myFunc.prototype); // empty object {} is logged.
```

### Instances created by the generator function are associated with the prototype property of the generator function.

The prototype property of the constructor function is an object in itself, but it is an unusual property that is associated with an instance through a prototype chain.

In other words, when you create an object using the constructor function with the keyword `new`, there is a kind of hidden connection between the prototype property of the constructor function and the newly created object instance.

In some browsers, this link may appear as an instance`s `__proto__` property.

JavaScript automatically connects the instance object with the constructor function when it creates an instance using the constructor function, which creates a prototype chain.

The following code adds one attribute to the `prototype` of the native Array() constructor and uses the _`_proto__` attribute of the array instance to access the attribute added:

```js
The code works only with browsers (FF, Chrome, Safari, Android) implementing __proto__.
Array.prototype.foo = 'foo';

var myArr = new Array();
console.log(myArr.__proto__.foo);

// MyArr.__proto__ == Array.prototype, so foo will be recorded.
```

In fact, the attribute `__proto___` is not an official ECMA standard, so you can use a different method.

The constructor property in an object instance allows you to obtain constructors, which allows you to obtain prototype objects that the instance inherits.

Examine the following code:

```js
All instances of 'Array.prototype.foo = 'foo'; // Array() inherit the foo property.

var myArray = new Array();
//.constructor.prototype is a little complicated, but the foo attribute is available.
console.log(myArray.constructor.prototype.foo); // foo 가 기록된다.

// Of course, you can use the prototype chain.
console.log (myArray.foo); // Search Array.prototype.foo using prototype chain.
```

In this code, the foo attribute was found in the `prototype object`.

This was possible because there was a link between the Array() instance and the prototype object (==Array.prototype) of the Array() constructor.

Simply put, myArray.__proto__ (or myArray.constructor.prototype) refers to Array.prototype.

### The end of the prototype chain is Object.prototype.

Because the prototype property is an object, the endpoint of a prototype chain or prototype search is `Object.prototype`.

```js
var meArray = [];
console.log(meArray.foo); // undefined is recorded.

/*
I couldn't find foo in meArray.foo, Array.prototype.foo, Object.prototype.foo.
foo records undefined.
*/
```

After creating an empty array called meArray in the code above, we approached the property that is not defined in meArray to retrieve the prototype chain.

JavaScript will first look for the foo attribute in the meArray object, but will try to retrieve it again in `Array.prototype` because it cannot find it.

However, we can`t find it here either, so we`ll look for the foo attribute at the last destination, `Object.prototype`.

However, the foo attribute will eventually be `undefined` because it cannot be found here, the end point of the search.

### The prototype chain returns the first property found in the chain.

We will modify the code that we used right before and add the same properties to the `Object.prototype` and `Array.prototype` objects and try to access the values in the array instance.

The value of the `Array.prototype` object will be returned.

```js
Object.prototype.foo = 'object-foo';
Array.prototype.foo = 'array-foo';

var arr = [];
The 'array-foo' found in console.log(arr.foo); // Array.prototype.foo is recorded.

arr.foo = 'bar';
The 'bar' found in console.log(arr.foo); // arr.foo is recorded.
```

In this code, the foo value of Array.prototype.foo will mask the foo value of Object.prototype.foo.

When searching for properties in a prototype, use the first property you found and exit the search.

It doesn`t matter how many more properties of the same name were in the chain.

### Replacing the prototype property with a new object deletes the default constructor property.

The default value of the property `prototype` can be replaced with another value.

However, if you change the prototype property, the default `constructor` property that was seen in the original prototype object will also disappear.

The following code creates a Foo constructor function, replaces the prototype property of Foo with an empty object, and checks if the constructor property of the instance disappears.

The constructor property will now refer to the `Object()` constructor in this code.

```js
var Foo = function Foo() {

};

Foo.prototype = {}; // replaces the prototype property with an empty object.

var fooInstance = new Foo();
console.log(fooInstance.constructor == Foo); // false 가 기록된다.
// The reference is broken. In other words, the connection is broken.

console.log (fooInstance.constructor); // Object(), not Foo constructor function, is logged.


// compare the prototype value to the one that has not been replaced.
var Bar = function Bar() {

};
var barInstance = new Bar();

console.log(barInstance.constructor == Bar); // true 가 기록된다.
console.log (barInstance.constructor); // Bar constructor function is recorded.
```

If you intend to replace the default prototype property set by JavaScript, i.e. the `constructor` property referencing the constructor function must be restored to its original state if the method is often used in JavaScript object-oriented patterns.

The following will modify the preceding code a little to ensure that the constructor property correctly references the original constructor function.

```js
var Foo = function Foo() {

};
Foo.prototype = { constructor : Foo };

var fooInstance = new Foo();

console.log(fooInstance.constructor == Foo); // true 가 기록된다.
The console.log (fooInstance.constructor); // Foo constructor function is logged.
```

### The property inherited from the prototype uses the most recent value.

Attributes inherited by an instance from a prototype always use the most recent value, regardless of how the attribute was created, changed, or added.

The following code created the Foo constructor, added the attribute x to prototype, and created an instance of the Foo() constructor with the name fooInstance:

Here, we recorded the value of x once, modified the value of x included in the prototype property of the constructor, and then recorded the value of x again.

This will allow us to know that the value that the instance imports from the prototype object is the last value.

```js
var Foo = function Foo() {

};

Foo.prototype.x = 10;

var FooInstance = new Foo();

console.log (FooInstance.x); // 10 is logged.

Foo.prototype.x = 20;

console.log (FooInstance.x); // 20 is logged. FooInstance has also been updated.
```

This can be viewed equally, whether you have used the default prototype object or replaced it with a new object.

The following code attempts to prove this fact using a new object instead of the default prototype object.

```js
var Foo = function Foo() {

};

Foo.prototype = { x: 10};

var FooInstance = new Foo();

console.log (FooInstance.x); // 10 is logged.

Foo.prototype.x = 20;

console.log (FooInstance.x); // 20 is logged. FooInstance has also been updated.
```

### Replacing the prototype property with a new object does not update previously created instances.

From what we`ve seen so far, you may think that you can replace the prototype property completely at any time and that all instances will be updated.

But this is a wrong idea.

When you create an instance, the prototype and the instance are tied together when you create the instance, so if you set a new object in the prototype property, the connection between the already created instance and the new prototype is broken.

However, you can use the previous method to find the prototype object at the time you created the instance, modify or add the value, and update the associated instance with this prototype.

```js
var Foo = function Foo() {

};

Foo.prototype.x = 10;

var FooInstance = new Foo();
console.log (FooInstance.x); // 10 is logged as expected.

// Replace/Define the prototype object with the newly created Object() object.
Foo.prototype = {x: 20};

console.log (FooInstance.x); // 10 is logged.
/**
* Shouldn't it be 20 since we updated the prototype with a new object above? You can think of it as
* FooInstance refers to a prototype object at the time when it was still first created as an instance.
**/

// Try creating a new instance of Foo().
var NewFooInstance = new Foo();

// The newly created instance will be tied to the new prototype object {x : 20}.
console.log (NewFooInstance.x); // 20 is logged.
```

What you can see here is that after you create an instance, you should not replace the prototype property of the object with a new object.

If you replace it with a new object, even instances created in the same constructor will reference different prototype objects.

### Custom constructors can inherit prototypes just like native constructors.

We`ve looked at how JavaScript uses the prototype property to inherit (for example, Array.prototype).

You can apply the same pattern to non-native, user-created constructors.

The following code mimics JavaScript inheritance patterns by creating objects with the Person user constructor function:

```js
var Person = function () {

};

// All Person instances are defined to inherit the properties legs, arms, and countLimbs.
Person.prototype.legs = 2;
Person.prototype.arms = 2;
Person.prototype.countLimbs = function () {
return this.legs + this.arms;
};

var chuck = new Person();

console.log (chuck.countLimbs()); // 4 is recorded.
```

After creating the Person() constructor function from the code above, you have added several attributes to the prototype property of Person() to define all instances to inherit.

This code uses the prototype chain the same way JavaScript used to inherit native objects.

If you create a constructor function that inherits attributes from a prototype when there are no passed parameters, you`ll understand this a little better.

In the following code, the Person() constructor uses the passed parameters to add instance properties if they exist, but if there is no or only one passed value, it uses the inherited value from the prototype.

If an instance property exists, the inherited property is deprecated.

Therefore, you will be able to use the property in any case without any problems.

```js
var Person = function (legs, arms) {

// mask the values inherited from the prototype.
if (legs !== undefined) {
this.legs = legs;
}
if (arms !== undefined) {
this.arms = arms;
}

};

Person.prototype.legs = 2;
Person.prototype.arms = 2;
Person.prototype.countLimbs = function () {
return this.legs + this.arms;
};

var chuck = new Person(4,4);
console.log (chuck.countLimbs()); // 8 is recorded.

// If parameters are not passed
var chuck2 = new Person();
console.log (chuck2.countLimbs()); // 4 is recorded.
// Person does not have properties because there are no parameters passed.
// However, the results of the search through the prototype chain indicate that it recorded 4.
```

### Create Inheritance Chain

Prototype inheritance is designed to mimic the inheritance patterns found in traditional object-oriented programming languages.

In JavaScript, an instance is an object that can simply access the properties of another object.

To do this, you can first create an instance of the parent object that you want to inherit, and then assign it to the prototype of the constructor to inherit the parent object.

After you assign an instance of the parent object to the prototype property, a link (__proto) exists between the parent object constructor`s prototype and the inherited object.

Explore the following code:

```js
var Person = function () {
this.bar = 'bar';
};

Person.prototype.foo = 'foo';

var Chef = function () {
this.goo = 'goo';
};
Chef.prototype = new Person(); // Person() Assign an instance of the object

var cody = new Chef();
```

In the code above, the Chef object (=cody) inherits the person.

In other words, if a property is not found in a Chef object, it is then found in the prototype of the Person() constructor function.

All you need to do to create this inheritance relationship is assign an instance of the Person() object to the value of Chef.prototype.
