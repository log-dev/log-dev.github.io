Argument Object

Three parameter values can be used even if three parameters are passed over to the parameters of the function being called, such as test (5, true `str`) and the parameters of the function being called do not write the names being received.

The parameter value of the function called is stored in the function called in, and the parameter value of the function called in is stored in the parameters object.

The object name is required to access the objects in the called function.

In other words, the parameter values of the function called to the arguments object are stored sequentially, and even if the function being called does not specify the parameters, the empty values are stored, but the value itself is missing.

In other words, an argument object is an object whose factors are passed over when a function is called in an array.

What is unusual is that the object is stored in an array, but it is a similar array object, not an actual array.

Let`s take a look at the following code.

```js
// Process parameter values through argumets objects even though parameters are not specified for the function being called
function arg() {
if( arguments[0] !== undefined
```

Even if you do not name the parameter, as in the example code, you can use the parameter values passed from the called function, but they are not necessarily good.

Naming the parameters of the function being called in increases the readability of the code, but otherwise, it may be difficult to determine the role of the parameters.

Therefore, the use of the objects is recommended in the event of an exception or additional occurrence with explicit parameter designation.

It`s the same as the code below.

```js
var getPrice = function(qty, price) {
var amount;
if(qty !== undefined
```

Next, let`s learn about the length property of the objects.

Most JavaScript objects have length properties, and the length properties have different uses.

The lenth property value of a function object represents the number of parameter names for the function being called, and the parameters object also has a length property, and the number of parameters passed by the function being called.

Let`s take a look at the following code.

```js
var lengthProp = function(one) {
// output the length property of the arguments by the function you are calling
console.log('arguments : ' + arguments.length);
};

// output the length property of the function based on the function being called
console.log('lengthProp 파라미터 수 : ' + lengthProp.length);

// function called
lengthProp(1,2,3);
lengthProp([4,5], 6);
```

So let`s take a closer look at the structure of the objects in arguments, where there is a length property and another property.

Looking at the code above, the value specified in the first parameter could be obtained with the argument[0], and the value of the argumets object could be extracted with an index ([0]), which could lead to misunderstanding of the arguments object as an array.

However, the object "arguments" is not an array because it means an object in the form {name : value}.

And because it is in the form of an object, the value of the objects can be obtained through the for-in statement.

Let`s take a look at the following properties that make up the argumets object.
