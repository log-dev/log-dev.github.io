What is encapsulation? It`s hidden!

Encapsulation is the preservation and protection of sensitive data.

Encapsulation is usually the task of grouping related variables and functions into classes. However, you may think that this is similar to creating a class. However, encapsulation has a hidden nature that can keep important data or functions out of the class.

### Encapsulation supported by regular OOP

Regular OOP languages provide access specifiers

- public
- protected
- private

### Encapsulate in JavaScript

- Default public
- Private,protected by _ paste declaration.

```js
function MyClass() {

//public property
this.property name = value;

//private/protected property
this._property name = value;
}

// public method
MyClass.prototype.메서드이름 = function() {

}
// private/protected methods
MyClass.prototype._메서드이름 = function() {

}
```

Attaching _(underBar) is an implicit promise not to access and use an underbar-mounted property or method from the outside.

It is equivalent to capitalizing the start character of the class (generator function) name.

Encapsulation

- An object`s field (attributes), a method that binds together and hides its actual implementation from the outside.
- An external object does not obtain its internal structure, and only fields and methods provided by the object are available.
- The reason for encapsulating and protecting fields and methods is to prevent objects from being compromised by external misuse.
- Java uses Access Modifiers to determine whether to expose or hide encapsulated members.

### What is Inheritance?

In the real world, inheritance is the act of parents passing on their children, and the act of parents choosing and passing on their children, but inheritance in object-oriented programming refers to the fact that children choose and inherit their parents as opposed to the real world.

- The child (child, derivative) class inherits members of the parent (parent) class
- The child`s choice of parents to inherit.
- Inherit From : Parent`s Fields and Methods

### Polymorphism in object-oriented programming

Polymorphism is a property that allows you to substitute (use) objects of the same type but with different execution results.

All child objects can be substituted for the parent type, and the child type is automatically converted to the parent type.

Polymorphism can partitions objects.

In other words, if there is an object, assuming that the tire part used in the design of the car is a tire type, if there is a Korean tire and a Kumho tire, the performance of each tire can vary depending on what type of tire you use.

That`s why Kumho Tire, Korea, can make objects into parts as children`s objects.
