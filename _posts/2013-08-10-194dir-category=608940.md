Learn how to set up vmware in Ubuntu.

### Graphics

The graphics card driver for vmware seems to be provided virtually by vmware.

```bash
/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p

```

### Resolution throttling

The resolution adjustment of vmware is done by installing vmware-tools. The Ubuntu desktop version is possible, but the server version was not required.

1) Select vmware menu vm > Install VMware Tools

2) The CD will be inserted automatically and the contents will be shown, but the compressed file (VmwareTools-version name).The tar.gz)

Extract and enter the folder to vmware-install.After opening the pl (click), select Run at Terminal from the information window.

3) Select Yes from all subsequent options.

4) Reboot

5) Activate the view > Autosize > Autofit Guest in the vmware menu.

6) The resolution is automatically adjusted by dragging the edge of the vmware window.

Since vmware-tools does not seem to work with Ubuntu server versions, let`s modify /etc/default/grub directly to adjust the resolution or connect to Putty or XShell.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/default/grub

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="vga=0x316"

```
