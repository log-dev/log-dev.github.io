Introducing how to install Windows 8.1 in UEFI mode and how to optimize for better performance.

### Windows 8 boot rate secret, hibernation mode and UEFI

Microsoft`s significant improvement in Windows 8 bootup speed is the use of hibernation. As many people are well aware of the power saving mode, it refers to the PC screen turning off and the PC turning off, but the work that was being processed right before the shutdown reappears on the screen. When the power is cut off, the data in memory that is erased is stored on the PC, and the data is loaded when the PC is turned on, making it the same as before.

In addition, Windows 8 also supports Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), which significantly reduces the time from the post-stage to the Windows loading stage. UEFI support is not new because it has been supported on Windows 7, but it must be made to support Windows 8 boot-up speed to optimize Windows 8 boot-up speed.

For your information, according to Microsoft data, UEFI can read 1MB of data at a time, but only 64KB of existing biosystems can read. Due to the difference in speed of the protocol itself, the UEFI method is bound to be fast.

### Introducing Secure Boot

I do not use Secure Boot. But leave relevant information in case you use it.

Secure Boot is a new feature of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) that protects computers from malware attacks and infections in Windows 8. When computers are manufactured, UEFI creates a list of keys that identify trusted hardware, firmware, and operating system loader code. It also creates a list of keys to identify known malware.

When Secure Boot is enabled, it blocks threats from your computer before a potential threat attacks or infects it. For example, Secure Boot can block a computer from starting on an illegally copied CD or DVD that can damage the computer. It does not block the correct recovery disk or Windows disk.

Secure Boot must be disabled to use hardware that is not recognized by Secure Boot (for example, an older video card) or to boot from an unrecognized CD or DVD. If Secure Boot does not recognize the hardware, Windows does not use that hardware when booting, which can cause problems when starting the computer. If Secure Boot does not recognize the video card, the display on the computer may be blank.

Most parts manufactured for Windows 8 can use Secure Boot. For finished products based on these products, Secure Boot may be set by default in UEFI settings on the main boards. Parts manufactured for versions prior to Windows 7 must be upgraded to a BIOS version compatible with UEFI before Secure Boot can be used.

The ASRock H77 Pro4/MVP currently used can be set up in UEFI SETUP > Security > Secureboot. Save the changes and exit.

Secure Boot should be disabled if any of the following problems occur:

- My computer doesn`t start after I install a new video card, or a blank screen appears.
- After you install new hardware, your computer displays a blue screen or BOIS error message.
- Unable to boot from CD or DVD with Secure Boot enabled.

### Introducing Fast Boot

Fast Boot is a technology that can be activated when Windows is installed in UEFI mode starting with Windows 864bit. It is a feature that uses UEFI to skip hardware and setup tasks that are checked by the existing ROM BIOS and passes the Windows bootloader part to the BIOS to speed up the boot.

- Chipset of main manufacturer shall support this.
- The ASRock mainboard supports a step-up feature called Ultra Fast, which requires UEFI GOP support to boot the VBIOS when using an external graphics card (as if it supports my graphics card Colorful Gtx 560ti support).

The ASRock H77 Pro4/MVP currently used can be set in UEFI SETUP > Boot > Fast Boot.

It is not possible to enter the UEFI Setup screen using the keyboard. Therefore, it is necessary to clear CMOS or enter the UEFI restart menu from Windows.

You can enter UEFI with Settings > Power > Shift + Restart > Troubleshooting > Advanced Options > UEFI Firmware Settings. ASRock provides Restart to UEFI utilities.

### Pre-installation preparation in UEFI mode

- UEFI-enabled, up-to-date mainboards
- Latest BIOS with Windows 8/8.1 Fast Boot
- Windows 8/8.1 64bit (32bit supports BIOS MBR only - popular Windows integrations do not have auefi installation because the skeleton file is 32-bit)
- After FAT32 format, copy the "boot, efi, sources" file to the USB for installation
You can grill it using UltraISO. (USB-HDD+, xpress boot, fat32 = all default settings.)
Depending on the main board, it also works in NTFS format.
- Fast and expensive state-of-the-art SSDs (optional)

- 32-bit Windows does not support UEFI functionality.
- Only 64-bit Windows can use features enabled by the 64-bit UEFI firmware.
- Fortunately, current UEFI implementations include `Compatibility Support Module (CSM)`, which emulates BIOS support.
- CSM enables 32-bit operating systems and other operating systems that do not support UEFI mode booting.
- However, because CSM emulates older BIOS, operating systems that require CSM to boot cannot use certain UEFI features.

### Installing in UEFI mode

- Reboot the PC and use the F11 key to enter the Boot Menu to select devices such as UEFI: USB_DRIVE.
- If a screen that selects partitions appears during installation, delete all partitions to install Windows (installation does not proceed under existing MBR partitions), make them blank, and install them there.
The disk automatically uses a GPT partition table, which generates 100MB (EFI-system), 300MB (MSR), and frequency.
In order to identify the partition type of existing disk, it is possible to run `diskpart` at the command prompt and run `list disk` to check whether there is * in the Gpt part of the last column of the printed table.
I proceeded with the installation of Windows 8.1 Pro KVL version and used ko_windows_1_pro_vl_x64_dvd_2791388.iso. During installation, Product-Key was entered and a computer name and Microsoft Live account were created.
- Uninstall USB and enter UEFI Setup when the window installation is complete and reboot.

New mainboards using UEFI bios have features to speed up the POST stage, a menu called Fast Boot, which allows you to adjust the PS/2 keyboard and mouse handled during the POST stage, as well as the USB port and network driver load.

### Verify UEFI Mode Installation

If a C:\Windows\Panther\setupact.log file contains a phrase such as "Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected Boot Environment: ?EFI", it is installed as UEFI. If a phrase such as "Callback_BootEnvironmentDetect: Detected Boot Environment: BIOS" is found, it was installed as normal and failed.

The above setupact.log file may be denied access. At this time, it would be necessary to run the notepad with administrator privileges and then access the path through the opening of the notepad menu to open the file.

### How to enter UEFI after setting up Fast Boot

Fast Boot does not allow users to enter the UEFI Setup screen using a keyboard, but it can be entered in the following ways:

- Clear the CMOS.
- Enter UEFI Restart Menu from Windows, Settings > Power > Shift + Restart > Troubleshooting 해결 Advanced Options > UEFI Firmware Settings
- ASRock provides Restart to UEFI utility
