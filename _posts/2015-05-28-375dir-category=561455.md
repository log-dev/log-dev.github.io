There are many types of media players, but I just use a pod player that I can use without any specific settings. Recently, you can watch my Little Television live.

### Introducing Podplayer

It is a multimedia player that can play a variety of video files, and it is an application that allows users to enjoy live broadcasts with chatting and personal broadcasting.

### Installing the Pod Player

Download the pod player from the homepage and run the installation. At this time, there are many traps prepared, so you should keep that in mind.

Uncheck according to your preference.

- Create a playback-only version short icon on the desktop
- Installing the Daum Cleaner
- Set Daum to Start Page and Default Search

When the pod player is installed, additional codecs must be installed. This part is said to have been separately separated due to copyright issues.

Install codecs according to your preference (select all of them because you don`t know where they are used).

You can call the menu with a right click on the pod player. I don`t know the detailed setting. It`s just the purpose of playing the video, so...
