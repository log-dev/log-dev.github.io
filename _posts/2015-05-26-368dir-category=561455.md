Update is the first thing you do after installing Windows. Traditionally, Windows has released a collection of updates under the pretext of a service pack, but it has not followed that approach since Windows 8.

### Windows Update

You can check the menu in Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Update. With Windows native installation, automatic updates are enabled, and the latest security and other important updates are downloaded from Microsoft.

- Check for updates : Check for updates.
- Change Settings : Modify the update schedule. Automatic installation of updates is recommended, but the recent Windows 8.1 update error is frequent... You can turn off the update feature by selecting "Don`t check for updates" in the Critical Updates section.
- View Update History: Lists the list of updates that have been successfully installed or failed. It is sometimes used to find a list of failed updates.
- Restore Hidden Updates: Hidden updates are updates that Windows has requested that are not notified or installed automatically.

### Recently, for frequent Windows 8.1 update failures,

I experienced four to five failed updates using Windows 8.1. When the update failed, only the mouse moved on the black screen even if it did not boot or boot. It will not be well received because this phenomenon will come suddenly when automatic updates are activated. It was restored to the image that was backed up a few times, and restored to a successful configuration a few times. Every time, he dreamed of returning to Windows 7.

Looking for the reason for the failure of the update, I found that there was a problem with Microsoft`s update configuration, and I also found problems with internal graphics cards and external graphics cards. Some have also mentioned problems with programs that make classic changes to the start menu.

I recently experienced a black screen phenomenon, which led to the initialization of the computer. This symptom, of course, was caused by blocking the update function, so it is believed that it has nothing to do with the update. With the new installation of Windows 8.1, Windows Update was first run, and all updates were successful.
