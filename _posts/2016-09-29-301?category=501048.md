Prototype Chain

JavaScript automatically creates a property called `prototype` in the Function() instance.

Specifically, the `prototype` property is associated with an object created using the new keyword and the constructor function.

Instances share and inherit common methods and attributes through the `prototype` property of the constructor function.

The important thing is that these shares occur while retrieving properties.

That is, when we find or approach a property of an object, JavaScript looks for that property not only on that object but also on the prototype chain.

The following code uses the `Array()` constructor to create an array and then invoke the `join()` method of the array:

```js
var myArray = new Array('foo', 'bar');

console.log (myArray.join()); // 'foo, bar' is recorded.
```

The `join()` method is an attribute that is not defined in myArray object instance.

However, the user was able to use the `join()` method as if it had existed.

Clearly, this method will be defined somewhere.

But where is it defined?!

This method is defined as a property in the `prototype property` of the `Array()` constructor.

Because there is no join() method in an array object instance, JavaScript searches the prototype chain for a method called join().

Why did they make it work this way?

In fact, this is a matter of efficiency and reuse.

Is it necessary to add the join() method, which always works the same way for each instance of the array constructor function?

It would be more reasonable to import one join() function from every array than to create a new function for every instance of the array.

JavaScript has created this efficiency through prototype properties, prototype linkages, and prototype chain search.

But to be honest, it might be better to just memorize the principles of how prototype chain inheritance actually works.

### Why is the prototype property important?!

The prototype property is important in four ways:

- Native constructor functions (e.g., Object(), Array(), Function(), etc.) use the prototype property to allow the constructor instance to inherit methods and attributes. JavaScript uses these mechanisms to enable object instances to inherit the prototype property of the constructor function. Therefore, to better understand JavaScript, you need to know how JavaScript uses prototype objects.
- When creating a custom constructor function, prototype inheritance can be implemented in the same way as JavaScript native objects. However, an understanding of the way inheritance is made must be accompanied.
- Although you may not prefer prototype inheritance or prefer other inheritance patterns, in reality, there is probably something that someone needs to modify or manipulate code implemented using prototype inheritance. At this time, we need to know how prototype inheritance works so that we can replicate the functions of the constructor functions created by other developers.
- Prototype inheritance allows us to create multiple efficient object instances that share the same method. As mentioned earlier, array objects, which are instances of Array() constructors, do not necessarily have to add the join() method to each instance. The prototype chain of all array instances stores the join() method, so all array instances can use the same join() method.

### Every Function() instance has a prototype property.

In JavaScript, a function was created by calling the Function() constructor directly (e.g., var add = new Function(`x`, `y`, `return x + y`); or by using the function literal notation (e.g., var add = function(x, y) {return x + y} ; all exceptions)

When you create a function instance, it always adds the prototype property.

At this point, the prototype property itself is the same as an empty object.

After defining a function called myFn in the following code, try accessing the prototype property of this function.

```js
var myFn = function() {};
console.log (myFn.prototype); // Object() is recorded.
console.log(typeof myFn.prototype); // 'object' 가 기록된다.
```

Although there is only one custom function used as a constructor in the code above, the Function() constructor grants the prototype property to all instances of the function()

### The prototype property is an Object() object.

The information about the prototype is a little difficult.

Technically, when creating a Function() instance, prototype is only a property whose default value is an empty object, named "prototype" by JavaScript.

If you code it yourself, you can write it as follows:

```js
var myFn = function() {};

// Add a prototype property and assign an empty object to the property value.
myFn.prototype = {};
console.log (myFn.prototype); // empty object is logged.
```

In fact, JavaScript has already rewritten what it did internally with code, and if you run the example above that you wrote with code, it works without any problems.

Instances created by the constructor function are associated with the prototype property of the constructor function.

The prototype property of the constructor function is itself an object, but it is an unusual property that is associated with an instance through a prototype chain.

In other words, when you create an object using the new keyword and the constructor function, there is a kind of hidden connection between the prototype property of the constructor function and the newly created object instance.

In some browsers, this link may appear as an instance`s `__proto__` attribute.

This property is currently supported only with Firefox2+, Safari, Chrome, and Android browsers.

JavaScript automatically connects the instance object with the constructor function when it creates an instance using the constructor function, which results in a prototype chain.

The following code uses the __proto__ property of the array instance to access the property after adding one property to the prototype of the Array() constructor:

```js
This code only works with browsers that can use __proto__.
// only works on Firefox 2 or higher, Safari, Chrome, and Android.
Array.prototype.foo = 'foo';
var myArray = new Array();

console.log (myArray.__proto__.foo); // foo is logged.
// myArray.__proto == Array.prototype 이다
```

In fact, the __proto_ property is not an official ECMA standard, so you must use another method.

The constructor property in an object instance allows you to obtain constructors, which also allows you to obtain prototype objects that the instance inherits.

Explore the following code:

```js
'Array.prototype.foo = 'foo ; // now all instances of Array() inherit the foo property.

var myArray = new Array();

//.constructor.prototype provides a little bit of a complexity, but foo attribute.
console.log(myArray.constructor.prototype.foo); // foo 가 기록된다.

// Of course you can use the chain.
console.log (myArray.foo); // foo is logged.
// is retrieved via prototype chaining. Array.prototype.foo is searched.
```

In this code, the foo attribute was found in the prototype object.

This is possible because there was a link between the Array() instance and the prototype object (=Array.prototype) of the Array() constructor.

Simply put, myArray.__proto__ (or myArray.constructor.prototype) refers to Array.prototype.

### The end of the prototype chain is Object.prototype.

Because the prototype property is an object, the end point of a prototype chain or prototype search is `Object.prototype`.

Examine the following code:

```js
var myArray = [];
console.log (myArray.foo); // undefined is recorded.

/**
* myArray.foo, Array.prototype.foo, Object.prototype.foo에서 foo를 찾지 못하여
* The foo attribute is undefined.
*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/
```

In this code, we tried to access an undefined property in myArray to create an empty array called myArray and then search for a prototype chain.

JavaScript will first look for the foo attribute in myArray object, but will try to retrieve it again in Array.prototype because it cannot find it.

However, you can`t find it here either, so you`re looking for the foo attribute at the last destination, Object.prototype.

The foo attribute eventually becomes undefined because it cannot be found here, the end point of the search.

In summary, the prototype chain ends with Object.prototype. The last place we looked for the foo attribute was Object.prototype.

### The prototype chain returns the first property found in the chain.

Like the scope chain, the prototype chain uses the first value it found while searching for the chain.

If you modify the code that you used earlier, add the same attribute to the `Object.prototype` and `Array.prototype` objects, and access the value from the array instance, the value of the Array.prototype object will be returned.

```js
Object.prototype.foo = 'object-foo';
Array.prototype.foo = 'arry-foo';

var myArray = [];
The 'array-foo' found in console.log (myArray.foo); // Array.prototype.foo is recorded.

myArray.foo = 'bar';
The 'bar' found in console.log (myArray.foo); // MyArray.foo is recorded.
```

In this code, the foo value of Array.prototype.foo is the result of masking the foo value of Object.prototype.foo.

When searching for properties in a prototype like this, it uses the first property it finds and immediately exits the search. And it doesn`t matter how many more properties of the same name were in the chain.

### Replacing the prototype property with a new object deletes the default constructor property.

You can substitute a different value for the prototype property`s default value.

However, replacing the prototype property will result in the disappearance of the default constructor property that was seen in the original prototype object.

The following code creates a Foo constructor function, replaces the prototype property of Foo with an empty object, and checks if the constructor property of the instance disappears.

```js
var Foo = function() {};
Foo.prototype = {}; // replaces the prototype property with an empty object.

var FooInstance = new Foo();

console.log(FooInstance.constructor === Foo); // false 가 기록된다. In other words, the reference has disappeared.
Object() is logged, not console.log(FooInstance.constructor); // Foo().
```

The above code now refers to an object() constructor attribute that is less useful.

The code below does not replace the prototype value.

```js
var Bar = function() {};

var BarInstance = new Bar();

console.log(BarInstance.constructor === Bar); // true 가 기록된다.
console.log(BarInstance.constructor); // Bar() 가 기록된다.
```

If you intend to replace the default prototype property set by JavaScript (often used in JavaScript object-oriented patterns), you will need to restore the constructor property that refers to the constructor function.

The following is a small modification of the preceding code so that the constructor property correctly references the original constructor function:

```js
var Foo = function Foo(){};

Foo.prototype = {constructor:Foo};

var FooInstance = new Foo();

console.log(FooInstance.constructor === Foo); // true가 기록된다.
console.log(FooInstance.constructor); // Foo()가 기록된다.

```

### Attributes inherited from prototypes use the most recent value.

Attributes inherited by an instance from a prototype always use the most recent value, regardless of how the attribute was created, changed, or added.

The following code creates the Foo constructor, adds the attribute x to prototype, and creates an instance of the Foo() constructor with the name FooInstance:

Here, record the value of x once, modify the value of x in the prototype property of the constructor, and then record the value of x again.

This will allow us to know that the value that the instance imports from the prototype object is the last value.

```js
var Foo = function Foo(){};

Foo.prototype.x = 1;

var FooInstance = new Foo();
console.log (FooInstance.x); // 1 is logged.

Foo.prototype.x = 2;
console.log (FooInstance.x); // 2 is recorded. FooInstance has also been updated.
```

If you understand how the prototype chain works, you won`t be surprised.

This can be viewed equally, whether you used the default prototype object or replaced the prototype object with a new object.

The following code attempts to use a new object instead of the default prototype object.

```js
var Foo = function Foo(){};
The code below Foo.prototype = {x:1}; // will behave the same way as before.

var FooInstance = new Foo();
console.log (FooInstance.x); // 1 is logged.

Foo.prototype.x = 2;
console.log (FooInstance.x); // 2 is recorded. FooInstance has also been updated.
```

### Replacing the prototype property with a new object does not update the previously created instance.

As far as we know, we can probably assume that the prototype property can be completely replaced at any time and that it will update all instances.

Unfortunately, however, this is wrong.

When you create an instance, the prototype and instances are tied together when you create the instance, so defining a new object in the prototype property breaks the connection between the already created instance and the new prototype.

However, using the method described earlier, you can find the prototype object at the time you created the instance, modify or add the value, and update the instance associated with it.

```js
var Foo = function Foo(){};

Foo.prototype.x = 1;

var FooInstance = new Foo();

console.log (FooInstance.x); // 1 is logged as a latent value.

// Replace/ Override the prototype object with the newly created object() object.
Foo.prototype = {x:2};

console.log (FooInstance.x); /* 1 is logged. Huh? We just updated the prototype, so shouldn't it be two? */
/* FooInstance still refers to the prototype at the time it was created as an instance. */

// Create a new instance of Foo().
var NewFooInstance = new Foo();

// The newly created instance is tied to a new prototype object (={x:2};).
console.log (NewFooInstance.x); // 2 is recorded.
```

What you can see here is that after you create an instance, you should not replace the prototype property of the object with a new object.

If you replace it with a new object, even instances created by the same constructor will reference different prototypes.

### Custom constructors can inherit prototypes just like native constructors.

We`ve looked at how JavaScript uses the prototype property to inherit (E.g: Array.prototype).

This pattern can also be applied to non-native, user-created constructors.

The following code mimics the inheritance pattern of JavaScript with Person objects:

```js
var Person = function() {};

// All Person instances inherit the properties legs, arms, and countLimbs.
Person.prototype.legs = 2;
Person.prototype.arms = 2;
Person.prototype.countLimbs = function() {return this.legs + this.arms;};

var chuck = new Person();

console.log (chuck.countLimbs()); // 4 is recorded.
```

After creating the Person() constructor function in the code above, we added several attributes to the prototype property of Person() so that all instances are inherited.

This code used the prototype chain in the same way it used to inherit JavaScript native objects.

If you create a constructor function that inherits attributes from a prototype when there are no passed parameters, you`ll understand this a little better.

In the following code, the Person() constructor uses the passed parameters to add instance properties if they exist, but if there is no or only one passed value, it will use the inherited value from the prototype. If an instance property exists, the inherited property is deprecated.

Therefore, you will be able to use the property in any case without any problems.

```js
var Person = function(legs, arms) {
// mask the values inherited from the prototype.
if (legs !== undefined) {this.legs = legs;}
if (arms !== undefined) {this.arms = arms;}
};

Person.prototype.legs = 2;
Person.prototype.arms = 2;
Person.prototype.countLimbs = function() {return this.legs + this.arms;};

var chuck = new Person(0, 0);

console.log (chuck.countLimbs()); // 0 is recorded.
```

### Create Inheritance Chain

Prototype inheritance was created to mimic the inheritance patterns found in traditional object-oriented programming languages.

In JavaScript, an instance is an object that can simply access the properties of another object.

To do this, you can first create an instance of the parent object you want to inherit and assign it to the prototype of the constructor to inherit the parent object.

After you assign an instance of the parent object to the prototype property, a link (i.e. `__proto__`) is created between the parent object constructor`s prototype and the inherited object.

In the following code, the Chef object (=cody) inherits Person():

In other words, if a property is not found in a Chef object, it is then found in the prototype of the Person() constructor function.

All you have to do to create this inheritance relationship is assign an instance of the Person () object to the value of Chef.prototype.

즉, Chef.prototype = new Person()

```js
var Person = function() { this.bar = 'bar' };
Person.prototype.foo = 'foo';

var Chef = function() { this.goo = 'goo' };
Chef.prototype = new Person();
var cody = new Chef();

console.log(body.foo); // 'foo' is logged.
console.log(body.goo); // 'goo' is recorded.
console.log (cody.bar); // 'bar' is logged.
```

The only thing I did in the code above was to borrow the system originally used by the native object.

The original Object() value or Person() value in the prototype property is no different.

In other words, accessing the object`s inherited property means that you will find the value in the constructor function `prototype(=Object.prototype)` property that created the object.
