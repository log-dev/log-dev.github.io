I`m sure many people will turn off iptables when they build the server and update or forget about related matters in the future. When you first encounter iptables, writing firewall rules does not seem complicated. Most home servers will use a router, but some people will ignore it. If you were curious about iptables, you came well.

### iptalbes란?

The iptables was developed by a netfilter project and provides a powerful mechanism for specifying a wide range of protocol state tracking, packet application layer checking, rate limiting, and filtering policies.

### Registering and Getting Started with Services

CentOS 6.4 Minimal has iptables installed. ip6tables is also installed, which is used by IPv6 schemes.

```bash
rpm -qa | grep iptables

iptables-1.4.7-9.el6.x86_64
iptables-ipv6-1.4.7-9.el6.x86_64

```

If not, install

```bash
yum -y install iptables

```

Check Status

```bash
chkconfig --list

ip6tables 0:Release 1:Release 2:Release 3:Release 4:Release 5:Release 6:Release
iptables 0:Release 1:Release 2:Release 3:Release 4:Release 5:Release 6:Release

```

Register the service with the startup program.

```bash
chkconfig iptables on

```

Start the service.

```bash
service iptables start

```

The file location for iptables is /etc/sysconfig/iptables.

### iptables terminology

Put aside the difficult terms and explain briefly what to use.

First of all, iptables has a broad category of tables, which consists of four tables: filter, nat, mangle, raw, and among them, what we need is a filter table that establishes filtering rules.

There are three predefined chains in the filter table: INPUT, OUTPUT, and FORWARD. These chains carry out established rules for any network traffic (IP packet).

For example, whether to allow (ACCEPT), reject (REJECT) or discard (DROP) incoming packets (INPUT).

- INPUT : All packets directed to the host computer
- OUTPUT : All packets that occur on the host computer
- FORWARD: All packets that the host computer is not the destination, that is, packets that pass through the host computer that are used as routers.

This refers to conditions that must be satisfied when processing packets in iptables. That is, only packets that satisfy this condition apply the rule.

- --source (-s) : origin IP address or matching with network
- --destination (-d): Matching to destination ip address or network
- --protocol (-p) : Matching with specific protocols
- --in-interface (i) : Input interface
- --out-interface (-o) : output interface
- --state : Match with connection status
- --string : Matching to App Layer Data Byte Order
- --comment : Up to 256 bytes of annotation associated with rules in kernel memory
- --syn (-y): SYN packets are not allowed.
- --fragment (-f) : specifies the rule for the second subsequent fragment.
- --table (-t) : table to be processed
- --jump (-j) : specifies how to handle packets that conform to the rule.
- --match (-m) : matches to specific modules

iptables supports targets that take action when a packet matches a rule.

- ACCEPT: Accept packets.
- DROP: Drop the packet (as if the packet had never been sent).
- REJECT: Abandon packets and at the same time transmit the appropriate response packets.
- LOG: Writes packets to syslog.
- RETURN: Continue processing packets within the call chain.

REJECT denies access to users who want to access the service and shows an error message connection refused, while DROP drops packets without literally showing any warning messages to telnet users. Although these rules are available at the discretion of the administrator, REJECT is recommended to prevent users from becoming confused and continuously attempting to connect.

iptables uses a method called connection tracking to allow monitoring and restricting connections based on the state of service connections on the internal network. The connection tracking method stores the connection status in a table, so the system administrator can allow or deny the connection, depending on the connection status as follows:

- NEW : Packet requesting a new connection, e.g. HTTP request
- ESTABLISHED: Packets that are part of an existing connection
- RELATED: For packets that belong to an existing connection but request a new connection, for example, manual FTP with a connection port of 20, the transport port is available for any unused port of 1024 or higher.
- INVALID : Packets that do not belong to any connection in the connection trace table

Stateful iptables connection tracking is available in any network protocol. It can also be used in stateless protocols such as UDP.

- -A (--append): Add a new rule.
- -D (--delete): Delete the rule.
- -C (--check) : tests packets.
- -R(--replace) : Replace with a new rule.
- -I (--insert): Insert a new rule.
- -L (--list): print out the rule.
- -F (--flush): Delete all rules from chain.
- -Z (--zero): Zero packet and byte counter values for all chains.
- -N (--new): Create a new chain.
- -X (--delete-chain): Delete chain.
- -P (--policy): Change the basic policy.

- The behavior of packets is checked for each rule in turn from the top, and the ACCEPT, DROP, etc. specified in the target are performed for packets matching the rule.
- When a rule is matched and an action is performed, the packet handles the result of that rule and ignores the additional rule in the chain.
- When a packet reaches the bottom of the rule because it does not match all rules in the chain, a set basic policy is implemented.
- The default policy can be set to policy ACCEPT and policy DROP.

Typically, the default policy sets DROP for all packets and causes ACCEPT to be performed on specifically specified ports and IP addresses.

When checking Iptables` rule set, it is more convenient to see if you do it below.

```bash
iptables -nL

Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
target prot opt source destination
ACCEPT all -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0
ACCEPT all -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22
ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:53
ACCEPT udp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 udp dpt:53
ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:80
ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:443
ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:3306

Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
target prot opt source destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination

```

There is also a way to check the application order of each rule set as shown below.

```bash
iptables -nL --line-numbers

Chain INPUT (policy DROP)
num target prot opt source destination
1 ACCEPT all -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0
2 ACCEPT all -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
3 ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:22
4 ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:53
5 ACCEPT udp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 udp dpt:53
6 ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:80
7 ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:443
8 ACCEPT tcp -- 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 tcp dpt:3306

Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
num target prot opt source destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
num target prot opt source destination

```

```bash
iptables -L -v

Chain INPUT (policy DROP 1626 packets, 214K bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
0 0 ACCEPT all -- lo any anywhere anywhere
944 194K ACCEPT all -- any any anywhere anywhere state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
0 0 ACCEPT tcp -- any any anywhere anywhere tcp dpt:ssh
0 0 ACCEPT tcp -- any any anywhere anywhere tcp dpt:domain
4 245 ACCEPT udp -- any any anywhere anywhere udp dpt:domain
6 304 ACCEPT tcp -- any any anywhere anywhere tcp dpt:http
0 0 ACCEPT tcp -- any any anywhere anywhere tcp dpt:https
2 88 ACCEPT tcp -- any any anywhere anywhere tcp dpt:mysql

Chain FORWARD (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 179 packets, 22190 bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination

```

### iptables settings

The following is the basic iptables setup for CentOS 6.4 Minimal.

```bash
iptables -L

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination
ACCEPT all -- anywhere anywhere state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
ACCEPT icmp -- anywhere anywhere
ACCEPT all -- anywhere anywhere
ACCEPT tcp -- anywhere anywhere state NEW tcp dpt:ssh
REJECT all -- anywhere anywhere reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination
REJECT all -- anywhere anywhere reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination

```

The default policy is ACCEPT for all packets, and SSH services are allowed by default. Let`s blow it out! I will write the rules of the new policy.

If it is set to DROP for basic policy establishment, it will not be able to connect to the server at that moment if SSH is connected remotely and in use. Therefore, let`s set the default policy to ACCEPT and change it back to DROP after SSH setup. If you are currently working on a console (on a server computer), there is no problem.

- Change Default Policy to ACCEPT
BASH
`iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
`
- Delete all rules defined in the chain
BASH
`iptables -F
`
- When I checked, all the rules were removed.
BASH
`iptables -L

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target prot opt source destination
`
- Allow all packets entering the local host interface to the INPUT chain
BASH
`iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
`
Typically, many software needs to be communicated with the localhost adapter.
- Add Allow for packets with ESTABLISHED, RELATED connectivity that match the state module to the INPUT chain
BASH
`iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
`
It is a rule that allows packets that belong to the INPUT chain (that have response packets) and packets that are not conventional but have associations (such as packets that form an ICMP error or ftp data connection).
- Add allow for packets with protocol call tcp and destination port 22 to INPUT chain
BASH
`iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
`
This allows SSH access. For telnet, destination port number 23
- Now change the default policy for the INPUT chain to abandoned (DROP)
BASH
`iptables -P INPUT DROP
`
- Change default policy for FORWARD chain to discard
BASH
`iptables -P FORWARD DROP
`
DROP packets for all forward because the server is not used as a routing device
- Change the default policy for the OUTPUT chain to Allow
BASH
`iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
`
- Confirmation of what you`ve set.
BASH
`iptables -L -v

Chain INPUT (policy DROP 108 packets, 12199 bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
0 0 ACCEPT all -- lo any anywhere anywhere
273 25012 ACCEPT all -- any any anywhere anywhere state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
0 0 ACCEPT tcp -- any any anywhere anywhere tcp dpt:ssh

Chain FORWARD (policy DROP 0 packets, 0 bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 9 packets, 1612 bytes)
pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination
`
- Save Settings
BASH
`service iptables save

iptables: Saving firewall rules to /etc/sysconfig/iptables: [OK]
`

Order is very important when creating iptables rules. For example, if the chain specifies that all incoming packets from the local 192.168.100.0/24 subnet are dropped, then the chain (-A), which allows incoming packets from 192.168.100.13, is subsequently added, the added additional rules are ignored. You must first set up a rule that allows 192.168.100.13, and then set up a rule that drops subnets.

### Allow other services

The following settings also describe OUTPUT in case the default policy is set to DROP (iptables-POUTPUT DROP).

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp -m multiport --dports 80,443 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 21 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp –-sport 21 -j ACCEPT

iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 1024:65535 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --sport 1024:65535 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 465 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 110 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 995 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 143 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 993 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-reply -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT

```

### Server Vulnerability Security

NULL packets are reconnaissance packets that are used as a way to find weak spots in server settings.

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL NONE -j DROP

```

Syn-blood attack is when an attacker creates a new connection, exits, and then consumes resources.

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp ! --syn -m state --state NEW -j DROP

```

Anti synflood with iptables

Edit /etc/sysctl.conf to defend against certain types of attacks and append / update as follows:

```undefined
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1
net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 8192
net.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_max = 1048576

```

XMAS is also a reconnaissance packet.

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --tcp-flags ALL ALL -j DROP

```

### Other Usage

To modify a registered iptables, modify it directly to vi in `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` or use the iptables command.

To check the execution sequence:

```bash
iptables -nL --line-number

```

The following example will modify the row in sequence 3 R(replace) - as shown below.

```bash
iptables -R INPUT 3 -p tcp --dport 2222 -j ACCEPT

```

Allow all packets for the loopback interface

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

```

Allow all packets for LANCARD specification

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j ACCEPT

```

Allow all packets for trusted ip

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.3 -j ACCEPT

```

Allow all packets for a trusted ip band

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT

```

Allow all packets for a trusted ip band

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 -j ACCEPT

```

Allow all packets for trusted ip and MAC addresses

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.3 -m mac --mac-source 00:50:80:FD:E6:32 -j ACCEPT

```

```bash
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6881:6890 -j ACCEPT

```

### automation script

If you frequently need to initialize and reset firewall settings, it is better to have an automation script. Below is an example of him.

```undefined
#!/bin/bash
# iptables Setup Automation Script
# Let's modify it according to your taste.
iptables -F

# Allow TCP port 22 for SSH connections
# Set up first for remote access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Set default policy
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

# Allow localhost connections
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

# Allow destabilized and linked connections
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Allow Apache Port 80
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

# Save Settings
/sbin/service iptables save

# Outputs the set contents
iptables -L -v

```

- Save the above after modifying it to suit your taste (myfirewall)
- Empowerment
BASH
`chmod +x myfirewall
`
- Practice
BASH
`./myfirewall
`
