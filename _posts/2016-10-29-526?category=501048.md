Statistic Member

Statistic properties and methods are properties and methods that do not depend on the instance.

In a class-based language, you can create a stacked member using a separate grammar and use it as if it were a member of the class itself.

For example, if the MathUtils class has a statistical method called `max()`, it can be called in the same way as `MathUtils.max(2,5)`.

This is an example of a public stat member, which can be used without creating an instance of the class.

Private statistical members are not visible to class users, but all instances of the class can be used together.

Let`s take a look at how JavaScript can implement public and private stat members.

### Public Statistic Member

JavaScript does not have a separate grammar to indicate stat members.

However, by adding a property to the constructor, you can use the same grammar as the class-based language.

This is possible because the constructor, like any other function, is an object and can have its own property.

The following example defines the statistical method `isShiny()` and the common instance method `setPrice()` in the constructor named Gadget.

`isShiny()` is a statistical method because it does not require a specific `Gadget` object.

It does not take a particular `Gadget` to find out if all `Gadget` shines.

On the other hand, individual `Gadget` may have different prices, so the `setPrice()` method requires an object.

```js
// constructor
var Gadget = function () { };

// Statistic Method
Gadget.isShiny = function () {
return 'you bet.'
};

// Add a typical function to the prototype
Gadget.prototype.setPrice = function (price) {
this.price = price;
};
```

Now let`s try calling this method.

The statistical method `isShiny()` is called directly through the constructor, but the usual method is called through the instance.

```js
// To call stat method
console.log(Gadget.isShiny()); // you bet

// Call method after creating instance
var iphone = new Gadget();
iphone.setPrice(500);
```

Invoking an instance method in the same way as a statistical method does not work.

Statistic methods also do not work when called using instance iphone objects.

```js
console.log(typeof Gadget.setPrice); // undefined
console.log(typeof iphone.isShiny); // undefined
```

In some cases, it may be convenient if the statistical method also works when called through an instance.

In this case, it is easy to implement simply by adding new methods to the prototype.

This new method acts as a facade that points to the original statistical method.

```js
Gadget.prototype.isShiny = Gadget.isShiny;
console.log(iphone.isShiny());
```

In this case, care must be taken when using this within the statistical method.

When calling `Gadget.isShiny(), this inside points to the Gadget constructor, but when calling `iphone.isShiny()`, this points to the iPhone, an object created by the constructor function.

Finally, let`s take a look at an example of how any method that can be called in a statistical way or in a non-static way behaves slightly differently depending on the way it is called.

Use the instanceof operator to determine how the method was called.

```js
// constructor
var Gadget = function (price) {
this.price = price;
};

// Statistic Method
Gadget.isShiny = function () {

// The following always works:
var msg = 'you bet';

if (this instanceof Gadget) {
// The following should only work when called in a non-static manner:(point to instance member)
msg += ', it costs $' + this.price + '!!';
}
return msg;

};

// add a typical method to the prototype.
Gadget.prototype.isShiny = function () {
returnGadget.isShiny.call(this); // this is the instance object created by the constructor function.
};
```

When you invoke non-static methods through statistical methods and instances, the following results appear:

```js
// Call Static Method
console.log (Gadget.isShiny()); // you bet is recorded.

// Call via instance in a non-static manner
var iphone = new Gadget(345.99);
console.log(iphone.isShiny()); // you bet, it costs $345.99!! 가 기록된다.
```

### Private Statistic Member

So far, we`ve looked at the public stat members.

This time, we will learn how to implement private stat members.

A private stat member has the following meanings:

- Members shared by objects created with the same constructor function.
- It is not accessible outside the constructor.

Take a look at an example of implementing a private stat property called a counter in the Gadget constructor.

The private property first creates a closure function, wraps the private member into it, and returns the new function as a result of running it immediately.

The function returned will be assigned to the Gadget variable and become the new constructor.

```js
var Gadget = function () {

// Statistic Variables/Properties
var counter = 0;

// returns a new implementation version of the constructor.
return function () {
console.log(counter += 1);
};

}; // execute immediately.
```

The new Gadget constructor simply increases the value of the private counter and outputs it.

If you create and test a few instances, you can see that actually all instances share the same counter value.

```js
'varg1 = new Gadget(); // 1 is recorded.
varg2 = new Gadget(); // 2 is recorded
Varg3 = new Gadget(); // 3 is recorded.
```

Because of increasing the counter by one per object, this stat property can be an ID that identifies the uniqueness of individual objects generated through the Gadget constructor.

The only identifier is useful, so wouldn`t it be good to expose it as a privileged method?

In addition to the previous example, try adding a privileged method called `getLastId()` to access the private stat property.

```js
// constructor
var Gadget = function () {

// Statistic Variables/Properties
var counter = 0,
NewGadget;

// This is the new implementation of the constructor.
NewGadget = function () {
counter += 1;
};

// Privilege Method
NewGadget.prototype.getLastId = function () {
return counter;
};

// overwrite the Gadgt constructor.
return NewGadget;

}; // execute immediately.
```

Test the new version below.

```js
var iphone = new Gadget();
console.log(iphone.getLastId()); // 1 이 기록

var ipod = new Gadget();
console.log(ipod.getLastId()); // 2 이 기록

var ipad = new Gadget();
console.log(ipad.getLastId()); // 3 이 기록
```

Public/private statistical properties are quite convenient.

You can hold methods and data that are not specific to a particular instance, and they are not regenerated every time by instance.
