Yesterday and today, I wrestled with Git, Gitolite, and GitLab.Although it is not easy to install and set up, it took a lot of time to detect errors in between.

If the error is an error during the installation process, I have been solving it somehow, but if it is based on my personal system settings, I am struggling to find a solution.

We also found a problem with security settings for Linux`s /tmp directory.

(I created an installation file other than /tmp directory and solved it.) )

The fact that only the administrator group was enabled to log in during SSH setup also became a problem for SSH access to Git.

(AllowUsers gave me a git account and solved it.) )

The last problem that bothered me today was related to domain, router, and vm-ware. Normally, a test server is established on vm-ware and reflected in the actual server, but the connection to the test server was accessed using an IP address.

I installed GitLab and finally, I created a repository on the web and tested Push on the client, but I looked at the Push address after wandering for a long time and found the gitlab that I set up when I installed GitLab.It was found to be the same domain address as uzuro.com.

Because my domain is set up on an external name server, if I use a domain to connect, I stop by an external name server to find the domain address and come back, so I go through my router once.

This is because the SSH port was not pointing to the test server with port forwarding.

There was no problem only when it was tested internally with local IP (192.168.0.X), but if it came through the outside, SSH access was restricted.

Hoo... eventually I found a problem and solved it, but I feel bad because I spend a lot of time doing these things.
