Function

Although we don`t often use Function in actual coding, we need to understand what it means and where it takes up.

That way, you can understand the function properly in the object-oriented programming world of JavaScript.

### Function vs. function

JavaScript provides a function called Function by default.

This is a function that creates a function instance.

The term "instance" is similar to "object".

However, while "object" is more general in meaning, "instance" can be described as "instant" with an instant nuance of "the very object currently created."

In fact, `Function` itself is an object.

As a result, sometimes the distinction between "Function object" means "function itself" or "function object created by Function" is ambiguous.

In these cases, the term "function instance" is usually referred to as the latter.

Similarly, "Object instance" means "object created by Object constructor".

However, the main purpose of the Object constructor is to create an object, which can also be described as an Object object.

The function used to create an instance is specifically called `constructor`, and if the object is the constructor that creates the instance of the object, then Function is the constructor that creates the instance of the function.

```js
var add = new Function("x", "y", "return x+y;");
```

The above code is an expression that creates a function instance named add.

This representation is also the same as defining the add function as follows:

```js
function add(x, y) {
return x + y;
}
```

When the program runs, this representation also creates a function instance called add.

The expressions "defining a function" and "creating a function instance" are different, but they are almost identical in meaning.

When you invoke the Function constructor, you can pass even a few string-type factors.

The last string becomes the implementation of the function and the factor before it except the last is the factor used to invoke the function.

As you can see from the code that uses Function and the code that uses Function when generating the preceding function, Function is difficult to use.

If the body of a function gets longer, it is never easy to write the body as a string in the last factor.

Therefore, when defining a function, we usually use function rather than Fucntion.

### Function vs. Object, Array

Just as the previously defined function add is an instance of Fucntion, `Object` and `Array` provided by JavaScript are also instances of Fucntion.

Just as the Function constructor is used with `new` to create a function instance, the Object and Array constructor are used with `new` to create an Object object and an Array object, respectively.

```js
var obj = new Object(); // Object 객체 생성
varr = new Array(); // Create Array Object'
```

Constructor objects, arrays, etc. are also often referred to as "type" or "type objects."

No matter how you put it, you need to remember that objects, arrays, and so on are functions.

You can also use literal representations to create object objects and array objects in addition to using the above new and constructors.

```js
varobj = {}; // Create Object Object Literal
varr = []; // Create Array Objects literal'
```

Object literal and array literal are also common methods of creating objects and arrays.

The last string factor passed to the Function constructor is the execution code of the function.

Object and Function are a kind of factory that creates object objects and function objects.

And the object that the Object function creates and the object that the Function creates are both objects, but the Function object is a function.

Just as an object created by an object shares a member defined by an object, all functions created by Fucntion share a member defined by Function.

The Object, Array constructor can also use the default members defined in Function as instances of Function.

This means that in JavaScript, all functions inherit Function, just as all objects inherit objects in object-oriented languages such as Java.

When you clean up the relationship of Function, Object constructor (function), Object object, the following are:

Function → Object → Object Object (Object Instance)

An object is also a Function instance as a function object, and the Object function allows you to create an Object object again.
