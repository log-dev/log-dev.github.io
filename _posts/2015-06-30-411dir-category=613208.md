The folding function of the sub-lime text was useful, but there was an inconvenience that the fold would not be saved the next time you exit and run the sub-lime text. We will find and introduce plug-ins that secure this.

### BufferScroll 소개

BufferScroll is a plug-in that restores selections, bookmarks, folding, selection syntax and cursor locations, scrolls, and when you open a file. The application also remembers different data depending on the location of the file (for example, the information in File A in the first window and File A in the second window, respectively).

- With preferences, scrolls, bookmarks, and folds can be synchronized between the actual and replicated windows. Synchronization settings are disabled by default. - > menu preferences - > package settings - > bufferscroll - > settings default to see must be activated.
- By request, the workline was automatically placed in the vertical center of the screen.
- When the folded surface is opened, the refold is available for selection in the command palette.
- Upon request, the option to select an area that has not been folded or folded.

### BufferScroll 설치

- After executing the sublime text, command Palette is recalled with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P.
- Select Package Control: Install Package, which is automatically completed when `install` is entered, and press Enter.
- When BufferScroll is detected by entering `buffer`, select it and press Enter to install it.

### BufferScroll 버그

- This application does not have an event listener for opening, closing, and changing projects and windows, and therefore cannot store data for the focused files. By not providing these listeners, this package has suboptimal methods for saving it`s data. Such listening change of views, focus lost, file closing, saving, etc.
- For some reason sublime API is not restoring scroll of xml/html documents, including: xml, tpl, html, xhtml See: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3
- There is no event listener for when a view is scrolled, then this package, has another suboptimal way of listening for changes of scroll, such tracking the scroll every x time.
