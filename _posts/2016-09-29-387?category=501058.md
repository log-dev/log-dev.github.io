Closure

The concept of closure can provide a basis for implementing private attributes/methods, public attributes/methods instead of the role of classes not in JavaScript.

Therefore, to understand object-oriented features such as encapsulation and information hiding, you must understand the closure.

Closure is a pattern employed by large libraries such as jQuery.

### JavaScript Closure

Defining a function produces a lexical variable scope in function units and configures a chain of variable scopes.

That is, for nested functions, the variable scope chain is configured to look exactly like the function is nested in the code, and the access to the variable is also structured in the code hierarchy.

Now let`s assume another situation.

Among the function roles in JavaScript, a function can be used as an object as a return value for another function.

Consider the problem with the variable scope of the function used as the return value.

Suppose the following code uses the function inner as a return value and runs on the code in another area:

The code is as follows:

```js
function outer() {
var x = 0;
return function(){
return ++x;
};
}

// Run Code
var x = -1;
var f = outer();
console.log(f()); // return 1'
```

The above code meets the conditions under which the closure is created.

- The internal function became an anonymous function and was used as the return of the outer.
- inner runs in the execution environment of the outer.
- The variable x used in the inner lies in the variable scope of the outer.

When this program is executed, an anonymous function defined inside the outer is passed to the outer part of the outer part of the parsing phase by `var f = outer();`.

The illustration of the situation described earlier shows the following.

Lexical environment for closures

When an anonymous function returned by the outer is called through f in the execution environment, where do we search for the variable x used in `return ++x;`?

Shall we color it from the variable scope object of the anonymous function generated when it was originally defined? Or should I search in the area where f is running?

This is similar to the lexical properties. In other words, the runter arbitrary variables are retrieved from the defined variable scope and chain based on the lexical environment.

Eventually, calling inner from the previous example code returns 1 by a ++x operation.

Now, let`s talk about something more important.

If you continue to call the function inner and see the results, you can see the following:

```js
'f(); // 2 Return
f(); // Return 3
f(); // Return 4'
```

Based on the results, it might look a little weird.

How can the x-value in the parent`s variable scope be maintained even after the call of f is completed?

A variable such as x in the outer used by the inner function, not a declared variable in the inner function, is called a free variable.

The outer does not determine when x is removed from memory. These free variables act as "close" to the environment in which the outer is running.

In x, the variable scope extends to the environment in which the outer runs.

The outer function is in the "running" state with reference f to the internal function in the external environment (i.e., unless f disappears from memory).

Therefore, the free variable x and its scope chain relationships remain in memory.

As such, a structure that can maintain the chain relationship between the local variables and the variable scope objects of the outer is called a closure even if the outer call ends.

In the case of free variables, the fact that the value is affected by the lexical environment and the life cycle is affected by the execution environment is the basis for creating a closure.

You`ve learned a lot just by understanding it up to here, but this is not the only thing you need to know about closure.

Wait here!

You need to know that the following functions created with Fucntion do not create a closure: Functions created using the Function constructor do not use a lexical region.

The function will always be compiled as if it were created in a global area.

```js
var x = "g";
function f() {
var x = "1";
Search for return new Function ("return x"); // x on the global variable scope.
}
var global = f();
print console.log(global()); // g.
```

The above code shows that the closure cannot be configured with function generated by Function.

Then let`s find out more about closure.

### Closer Instances

The term "closer instance" was used to mean an instance created by the closure.

This means that you want to see the closure as the unit that creates the instance.

A closure can be seen as a special function that uses the internal function as a return value.

In other words, the closure can be interpreted as a special function that creates a function instance.

The closure could be figuratively described as a "class that generates functions" compared to a class-like presence in a general object-oriented programming language.

Consider the outer function you saw earlier as a class and review it again.

```js
// outer definition
function outer() {
var x = 0; // Private Area
return function () { // externally callable area
return ++x; // public area
}
}

```

If you think about dividing the outer closure into the parts that define these private variables and the open areas that can be called externally, it will look more similar to the classes in other languages.

Now you can think of "call theouter" as "creating a function object" right away.

```js
'varf = outer(); // create an instance of outer'
```

Calling the function f returned by the closure can be considered as calling the method that the outer has disclosed to the outside world.

```js
'f(); // use the open function of the outer'
```

Unless "f" disappears, the variables that instance f has will remain.

Now let`s look at the following code:

```js
// outer definition
function outer() {
var x = 0; // Private Area
return function () {
return ++x; // public area
}
}

var f = outer();
f(); // 1
f(); // 2
var g = outer();
g(); // 1
g(); // 2

```

You called outer() to assign the generated function to f. When you call f to increase the value, the next time f is called, the previously increased value is maintained and the starting value of the second call.

The function f is taking advantage of the property of the closure where the internal variable x remains the same even when the call ends.

The important thing is from now on.

Once again, call outer() to assign a new instance to g, and then g to see the results indicate that "internal variable x is newly initialized".

The new initialization of the internal variable x means that the previous function f and the newly created function g are separate entities that use a completely different variable space.

Each time you create an instance as a class, an instance with its own closed space is created.

Therefore, the instance does not have direct access to internal variables in the closed space of other instances.

You can think of a closure as something that creates an instance with this closed space.

Calling a closure does not simply return an anonymous function, but also the closed space associated with it.

There is an internal variable in that closed space.

Just as you use classes and new to create instances with multiple closed spaces, you can use closers and () to create multiple instances with closed spaces over and over again.

The above f and g are now instances with independent variable space.

A closure instance is not just a reference to a function returned from a closure, but an instance with independent variable space.

This is the true meaning of the closure.
