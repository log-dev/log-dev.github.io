To link NGINX with PHP, you must use PHP-FPM (PHP FastCGI Process Manager). PHP-FPM is built into PHP from PHP 5.4RC and must be installed separately from earlier versions.

### Install MySQL

```bash
sudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client

```

### PHP-FPM Installation

In Ubuntu 12.04, php 5.3.10 version (as of 2013/09/15) is installed if php is installed using apt-get.

This version does not include PHP-FPM and should be installed.

When installing php-fpm, php5 is installed as a dependency.

```bash
sudo apt-get install php5-fpm

```

installing php5 module

```bash
sudo apt-get install php5-cli php5-mcrypt php5-gd

```

Link php-fpm to mysql

```bash
sudo apt-get install php5-mysql

```

### NGINX to PHP-FPM

Move the root directory setting of the `location / {` in the `server {` part of the `server {` file to make it a global setting and change the php setting.

```undefined
sudo vi /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf

server {
listen 80;
server_name localhost;
root html;
}

location ~ \.php$ {
# Fast access to Unix sockets
fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
fastcgi_index index.php;

# Set File Name
fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
include fastcgi_params;
}

```

Change settings file for php-fpm to UNIX socket also

```bash
sudo vi /etc/php5/fpm/pool.d/www.conf

listen = /var/run/php5-fpm.sock

```

fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;

```

restarting services

```bash
sudo service php5-fpm restart
sudo service nginx restart
