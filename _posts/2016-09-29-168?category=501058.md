Array

Array is a special form of JavaScript objects. In other words, it is an object that functions like an array of C or Java, but you don`t have to specify the size differently from them, and no error occurs when you store any type of data in any location.

JavaScript array is a data structure that stores data of any type in a continuous space. And each data storage location can be accessed by giving an index.

### Array Literals

You can also use Array() to use the array, but let`s look at the Bae Yeol Literals that are frequently used in posts.

Array literal is a notation used by JavaScript to create a new array. If the object literal was notation using braces ({}, the array literal uses square brackets ([]).

To create and access an array through an array literal

```js
var colorArr = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green'];
console.log(colorArr[0]);
console.log(colorArr[1]);
console.log(colorArr[2]);
console.log(colorArr[3]);

// Array approach: array variables [index]
```

The array is accessible through the index (0,1,2,3......) because each item is indexed to access the items in the array, and the index starts at zero. The index of the last array is - 1 for the number of items in the array. There are four entries in the code above, so if you do 4 to 1, the last index is 3. This is because the array index starts at zero.

Then, like the previous code, the element that you want to access in square brackets is accessed by putting the location index value in the array item. Also, the items in the array mentioned earlier are not usually called items, but elements.

### Necessity of Arrangement

Some of the reasons for using an array are:

> Used to reduce duplicate variable declarations
Used to facilitate the processing of elements using repetitive statements
Code Savings

For example, suppose you need logic to get the overall average of students.

The following is the code when the array is not in use:

```js
var score1 = 50,
score2 = 90,
score3 = 30,
score4 = 70;

var sum = 0;
sum = score1;
sum += score2;
sum += score3;
sum += score4;

console.log(sum);
```

The following code was processed using an array and a repeating statement.

```js
var score = [50,90,30,70],
sum = 0;

for (var i = 0; i < score.length; i++) {
sum += score[i];
}
console.log(sum);
```

Every array in JavaScript has a length property, which represents the number of elements in the array.

(It does not actually match the number of elements present in the array... For more information, maybe next time...)

You can see that the score.length value is 4. That is, the length property is the largest index in the array plus one.

The largest index of the array in the code above is 3, so the length property is 4. Conversely, if you subtract 1 from the length property, it will be the last index of the array. It`s the same as what I explained in the array literature before.
