Properties and methods related to the location, size, of the elements provided by jQuery

The properties and methods provided by jQuery are almost the same as the method as the location properties of other objects, but as you can see from the relationship between the inequalities [Javascript DOM Properties > jQuery Properties/Methods], there is a need to know JavaScript DOM Properties/Methods.

### offsetParent()

In JavaScript DOM, the closest of the ancestor nodes with the position property value set to relative or absolute becomes the parent coordinate node.

Assuming that the style is applied as shown above, if you obtain offsetParent coordinates for the child node, the parent coordinate node of child will be parent1, not parent2.

This is because the postion property value of parent2 is absolute, not relative or absoulte.

If the position attribute value is defined in parent2, the parent coordinate node will be parent2.

The offsetParent() method in jQuery makes it easy to obtain parent coordinates.

### offset().left

To obtain global coordinates based on the top-level node Document, use the offset() method.

Global coordinates refer to the position value of the top node, Document`s left:0, top:0; position as the starting point.

However, it is important to note that the window object is not the start location, but the Document object is the start location.

Please refer to the following picture.

If the amount of content is small, you may be confused that the window object`s starting position and the document starting position are the same, but if the document area is larger than the window area, you can see that the document area is used as the reference coordinate of the global coordinates.

To paraphrase one thing, if you`re going to open a house or a window, you can understand it as a wide and large document that you can see through the window.

Of course, if there is not much content, the starting point of the document and window will be the same.

### position().left

The position() method provided in jQuery allows you to obtain the local location value of the target element.

What is a local location (coordinate)?

As you can see above, if there is a parent coordinate node, it means the value of the location of the target node starting with the left:0, top:0 position of the parent coordinate node.

In other words, the position() method deals with the location of local coordinates relative to the parent node.

### width

The element size, unlike the element position, is a combination of padding + scrollbar + border + margin regions in its pure base size.

Please refer to the following picture.

As shown in the picture above, the size of the element for the target is as follows. (Based on width)

> 1. Target node.Width() can only be sized for the pure default element.
2. Target node.innerWidth() is the default size that is element and the size that contains the padding area. (default size + padding)>
3. Target node.outerWidth() is the default size, padding, and border area. (default size + padding + border)
4. Target node.outerWidth(true) is a parameter that sets the boolean value of true, which means that the default size, padding, and border contain up to the margin area.
(default size + padding + border + margin)
