LESS - The dymamic Stylesheet language

This article provides a quick overview of how to initialize and compile LESS when using LESS.

Because I am using editor webstorm, I am doing LESS compilation through this editor.

Instead of explaining how to compile in my editor, I would like to briefly introduce how to use GUI-based and CLI.

If you install LESS plug-in autoComplie from one of the editors using Atom, Bracket, you can compile it more easily.

### To apply LESS:

To write in the grammar of LESS.You must create a file with the less extension to create a LESS.

And this file is not used directly in HTML and is not applicable.

You must give the file a compilation (conversion to CSS) so that the browser can understand it.

There are two ways here.

One was created by less.js file provided by less.You can link to the bottom of the less file for interpretation, or WinLESS can compile it into an external compiler (GUI-based) and link it with the generated CSS file like the existing CSS link method.

There are many other ways to compile (using autoComplile within the editor).

Link to less.js to apply

This is a link method to use the less.js provided by the lescss site.

The advantage is that you only need to apply the less.js file without much compilation, so you can easily check and reflect it.

The downside is that it applies to IE9 and higher versions, Chrome, Firefox, etc., but it does not apply to IE8 and lower versions.

Rendering may also be delayed if the response rate is slightly slow and code-intensive and complex.

Download less.js

Apply to HTML

Apply the downloaded file under the less file in HTML.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<title>less</title>
<link rel="stylesheet/less" type="text/css" href="style.less">
<script src="less.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
<body>
<div>
<header>
<h1>index</h1>
</header>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

Less.js downloadable from LESS Client-side Usage

And the thing to be careful.The point is that you need to create a less.js under the less link.

Next, a GUI-based compiler tool that can be converted to CSS based on GUI is available.

You can take a file converted to a .css file and link it to the CSS file in the way you`ve written it before.

However, if you convert to CSS and hang a link, the less.js used above will no longer be used.

How to use the server side

This time we will learn how to install LESS on a server.

The method is to use npm, Node Package Manager. (npm must have node.js installed)

Here`s how::

Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g less
```

Command Line Instructions

Once installed, you can invoke the compiler from the following command line:

```bash
$ lessc styles.less
```

To create and save a CSS file by customizing the CSS you want to compile, you can do the following:

```bash
$ lessc styles.less styles.css
$ lessc styles.less > styles.css
```

You can use clean-css plugin to compress and output CSS files.

If the plug-in is installed, you can output it in complex mode by specifying `--clean-css` as an option.

```bash
$ lessc --clean-css styles.less styles.min.css
```

In addition to the methods mentioned above, you can also create and compile compressed files directly into theless file.

```css
// out: style.css, sourcemap: true, compress: true
```

You can set compress to true at the top of the less file. false is created as an uncompressed file.
