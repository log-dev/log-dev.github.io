Learn about some settings that enhance convenience after installing Windows. For me, the settings may vary because I am using Windows 8.1.

### Window Auto-Login

By default, Windows can log in and out using the account entered at the time of installation. If you are not afraid of other people`s access, automatic login can reduce inconvenience.

- Call the Launch Window with Win + R.
- Enter `control userpasswords2`.
- User name and password must be entered before this computer can be used - Unchecked
- Application
- When a notification window pops up to enter the password for the account, you enter the password for the account and automatically log in after rebooting.

### Windows Power Options Management

Power option management is set under Control Panel > Hardway and Sound > Power Options.

When you enter sleep mode, you often ask for a password when you turn it off. Let`s solve this laziness.

- Enable password on wake > Change settings currently unavailable > Enable password protection on wake - disable password protection
- Save Changes

Non-use HDDs are cut off after a certain period of time. Re-accessing HDDs takes time to operate, and increasing the number of accesses in this way is released because it affects the lifespan.

- Balanced (Recommended) - Change Settings
- Enable advanced power plan settings changes
- Advanced Settings - Hard Disk > Turn Off Hard Disk After > Settings: Disabled
- Check.

### Defragment and Unschedule Disk

SSDs do not require disk defragmentation.

- Run as Control Panel > System and Security > Administrative Tools > Drive Defragmenter and Optimization.
- Scheduled Optimization - Change Settings > Uncheck Schedule Run
- Check.

### Taskbar settings

Call task bar and navigation properties by selecting the right-click > property from the taskbar. I am using the following for using multiple monitors.

### Change Download Location

Select the attribute with a mouse click in the download folder of the "C:\Users\account name" or in the download of the explorer.

Location tab > Move > Select the desired location.

### Library Connection

Content located in multiple locations can be managed in one location to suit each library area.

- Right > Show Library on the left side of Explorer
- Double-click the library you want to add (ex. Pictures)
- Library Tools at the top of Explorer - Manage Tabs > Manage Libraries
- Add a folder of your choice

### Change folder/file icon

I already have several *.ico files. And basically, the icons provided by Windows are as follows.

- Icon embedded in C:\Windows\System32\shell32.dll library
- Icon embedded in C:\Windows\System32\imageres.dll library

You can change the icon using Right-click > Properties > Shortcuts - Change Icon in the folder or file you want.

### Installing frequently used fonts

It is a collection of fonts distributed by Naver as a campaign for "Hangeul Han-gul Beautiful." It is used for various website production and documentation.

Installing the Nanum Font

Install the font for coding.

NANUMGOTHICCODING_SETUP-2.0.EXE

I searched for a company called Qnix Computer, which is a production company, but it was not searched, and the copyright recorded on the font was until 1995, so I don`t think there will be any major problems.

I am using it to watch a movie.

### Link your mail account

The mail, people, and messaging apps built into Windows 8 work with Microsoft`s online services, Facebook, Twitter, and Gmail.

- Launch Mail App
- Settings ( Win + I ) - Account Execution
- Add Account - Another Account (Add Naver)
- Choose a connection method - IMAP
- Enter your mail address and password
