### Import Directives

The @import indicator recalls styles from different stylesheets.

The standard CSS `@import` syntax rule must be written before all other types. That is, it should be located at the top.

However, it doesn`t matter where the `@import` door is placed in LESS. As follows:

```css
.foo {
background: #900;
}
.bar {
text-align: center;
}
@import "this-is-valid.less";
```

File Extensions

The `@import` statement can be handled in different ways depending on the extension of the file.

- The file will be treated as CSS for .CSS extensions.
- If the file has a different extension, it will be treated as a less and recalled.
- If there is no extension `.A `less` is added and processed as a `less file and imported.

```css
'@import "foo"; // recognized as less if no extension exists
@import "foo.less"; // import to less
@import "foo.php"; // recognized as less if another extension
@import "foo.css"; // the .css extension still imports css'
```

### Import Options

The following options can be used to override the behavior:

LESS offers several options in CSS` @importCSS to provide more flexibility in what external files can do.

The import indicator is implemented as follows:

- Reference: Use less, but do not print with css.
- inline : include source file in output file but do not process it.
- Less : Treat any extension of a file as a less file.
- css: Treat any file extension as a css file.
- once : contains the file only once (default)
- Multiple : contains files several times.
- OPTIONAL: If the file is not found, proceed with compilation.

Multiple keywords are allowed in the `@import` statement, and users should use commas (,) to separate keywords.

```css
@import (optional, reference) "foo.less";
```

reference keyword

@import (reference) imports external files but does not compile and add styles unless referenced.

For example, suppose you have a foo.less file as shown above. And style.less file @import(reference) "foo.less"; style.Unless the foo.less reference selector is used in the less, the style of the exported foo will not be compiled into the CSS.

This can be very useful when using a different library.

If you are importing a bootstrap library, you can refer to it using mix-in and extend.

For example, you can perform certain themes and styles in a library, such as bootstraps, as shown below.

```css
.navbar:extend(.navbar all) {}
```

If you do this above, bootstrap will say, ".You will only be able to load the `navbar` related styles.

See the Pen

inline keyword

If the css file is incompatible with the less file, you can use `@import(inline)` to include external files.

Because LESS supports standard CSS well, but may not support CSS nuclei, annotations, etc. in this case, CSS files can be imported into an online keyword and used to output CSS to a single file in a good way.

Less keyword

Using `@import(less)` regardless of the file extension.You can use it to treat it like a less file.

It is an extension of `.css`, but this file is `.Treat it like a `less` file.

css keyword

With `@import(css)` you can use it to treat a file extension as .css without regard to it.

And the import syntax remains in the CSS output file. As follows:

```css
@import (css) "style.less";
```

```css
@import (css) "style.less";
```

once keyword

The default action for the `@import` statement is to import the file only once.

If you re-import the imported file, it means that the import syntax will be ignored.

```css
@import (once) "foo.less";
@import(once) "foo.less"; // this phrase is ignored
```

Multiple Keywords

You can use `@import(multiple)` to import multiple files with the same name.

It does the opposite of the `once` keyword.

```css
Assume that the file '// foo.less' is written as follows
.a {
color: green;
}
// In the main.less file, import the name file as shown below.
@import (multiple) "foo.less";
@import (multiple) "foo.less";
```

```css
.a {
color: green;
}
.a {
color: green;
}
```

optional

With `@import(option)`, the import syntax will only be executed if the file you are trying to load exists.

If you memport a file that does not exist without the `option` keyword, the file cannot be found and a file error will occur.

You can prevent compilation errors, whether or not you want to import files.
