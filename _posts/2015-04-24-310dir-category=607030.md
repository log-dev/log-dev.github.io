### BODY ELEMENT

The "body" element indicates the body area of the document. The body area is the space where real content is represented, where interactions with users are practically made. The body element also tells you the range that the browser should render.

### HEADER ELEMENTS

A newly added element to HTML5 is an area at the top of a web document that consists of a web site name, a global link (a link that can be used anywhere on the website, such as login, membership, site map, language selection, etc.).

```html
<header>
<h1>LOGO</h1>
<h2>Search</h2>
<input type="text">
</header>

```

- It consists of a site name (logo), navigation, headlines, search, etc.
- In the past, it was used in conjunction with "divid="header".
- It can be used in documents or in the header of each section or article, and can contain their title or brief introductory content.
- Once the browser is able to recognize the header area, it can help with the navigation of the screen reader and the index of the search engine.

### NAV Element

A new element added to HTML5 is an area where links are collected separately so that they can be moved to their destinations.

```html
<nav>
<h1>Main Navigation</h1
<ul>
<li>Menu1</li>
<li>Menu2</li>
</ul>
</nav>

```

- It is a systematic configuration of high-importance links among links, and it is possible to check whether they are simple body links and menu (category) links.
- The elements ul, li, and a still need to be used together.
- Once the browser is able to know the navigation area, it can also help the navigation of the screen reader and the index of the search engine.

### SELECTION ELEMENTS

A newly added element in HTML5, which displays a section.

```html
<section>
<article>
<h1>Title</h1>
<p>Body</p>
</article>
</section>

```

- It is intended to divide contents to create content flow and structure.
- The contents of the same personality, i.e. related contents, are grouped into section elements.
- Marking things with different personalities, such as news and advertising sections, as section elements, makes the area classification very clear.
- Each tab can be represented as a section element when it is a tab-style composition woven into subtopics under a top topic, such as a tab.
- The section is an independent area, so you can have a header and footer within the section. This means that each section can have its own title system, and each section can have its own H1 element.
- Screenreader users can move on a section-by-section basis, making navigation in documents easier, and search engines can index specific sections-oriented, thereby increasing the efficiency of search engines.

### ARTICLE ELEMENTS

A newly added element in HTML5, which displays independently constructed text.

```html
<article>
<header>
<h1>HTML5 Structure</h1>
<p>Published On <time datetime="2013-01-22">2013년1월22일</time></p>
</header>

<p>Body content</p>

<footer>Posted in unclepapa</footer>

<article> <!-- Start comment -->
<header>
Author:<a href=""">Narrow</a> at <time datetime="2013-01-22T08:45">January 22, 2013 08:45</time>
</header>

<p>Comment Content</p>
</article> <!-- End of Comment -->
</article>

```

- It can be constructed independently of the text and distributed or reused independently without affecting or being affected by other areas.
- Articles include posts on bulletin boards, blog posts, comments, and content contained in widgets.
- In general situations, the section element contains the article element. However, if independently constructed content consists of several sections, the article element may contain a section element.
- If the section element is the role of grouping related contents, the article element is the role of grouping independently composed texts from among related contents.
- A header and footer can be placed within the article area.
- If an article element is included in an article element, it means that the content of the outer element and the content of the inner element are related.

### MAIN Element

The main element was added to the HTML5 recommendation.http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/CR/

```html
<!-- other content -->

<main>
<h1>Apples</h1>
<p>The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree.</p>

<article>
<h2>Red Delicious</h2>
<p>These bright red apples are the most common found in many
supermarkets.</p>
<p>... </p>
<p>... </p>
</article>

<article>
<h2>Granny Smith</h2>
<p>These juicy, green apples make a great filling for
apple pies.</p>
<p>... </p>
<p>... </p>
</article>

</main>

<!-- other content -->

```

- Only allow the main element in the document to appear once.
- The content model is Flow content
- However, do not use the main element as a child of the article, aside, footer, header, nav element.
- Do not create an outline because it is not a section content

The main element is mapped to the role="main" of the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA), but the user agent recommends using the role="main" with the main element until this mapping is included.

### ASIDE Elements

It is a newly added element to HTML5, which contains separate content that is somewhat related to the entire page but not directly related to the main content.

```html
<aside>
<section>
<h3>Recent article</h1>
<ul>
<li>List1</li>
<li>List2</li>
</ul>
</section>
</aside>

```

- It is an area commonly called sidebar that consists of content that is less or less directly related to the text, such as banners, terminology descriptions, and related products.
- The search engine can ignore what is composed of aside elements and proceed with the index focusing on the body, and screen reader users can quickly identify what kind of area it is, so they can move to other areas immediately.

### FOOTER ELEMENTS

A newly added element to HTML5 is the area at the bottom of the Web document, consisting of copyrights, contacts, and more.

```html
<footer>
<address>
연락처 : <a href="mailto:webmaster@somedomain.com">help@example.com</a>.<br>
모질라 재단, 1981 Landings Drive Building K Mountain View, CA 94043-0801 USA
</address>
<small>Copyright
```

- Putter refers to the floor area or tail, which has a connection with the text, such as copyright and contact information, but is difficult to contain in the text.
- Typically, a putter area is provided only once within a document, but a footer element within a section element or an article element may display a tail for that area.
- The main navigation of the top-to-top link or header can also be placed in the putter area for repeat provision.
