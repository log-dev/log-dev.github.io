In this posting, you will learn about `line-height` in CSS.

### What is between lines?

When printing type prints with hand-arranged characters from a long time ago, they were made by attaching blocks of independent type horizontally.

In addition, line-to-line is added by placing a block of pieces to give the appropriate space between each line.

These inter-row representations can be adjusted in CSS using `line-height` to adjust the vertical margins between the lines.

How to use line-height

Browsers can use values from 1.0 to 1.2 as the initial default for line-height and specify the CSS `line-height` attribute as follows:

```css
p { line-height: 140%; }
```

`line-height` can be specified using five different units.

```css
'/* 1. Use normal value */
p { line-height: normal; }

/* 2. Use inheritance value */
p { line-height: inherit; }

/* 3. Use percentage */
p { line-height: 120%; }

/* 4. Use length unit values (px, em, etc.) */
p { line-height: 20px; }

/* 5. Use numeric values (without unit notation) */
p { line-height: 1.2; }

```

### Line-Height Calculation

Some properties of CSS are inherited. In other words, we pass on the value to the offspring.

In the case of `line-height`, the inheritance method is more complicated.

Use the following code to explore a variety of line-height examples that are actually used:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="354" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/MLOBeQ?height=354&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;slug-hash=MLOBeQ&amp;pen-title=line-height&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="line-height" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_MLOBeQ"></iframe>

The code above has a document structure (tree) as shown below.

#1 percent value used

For example, suppose you specify the `body` element as a percentage value of 120%.

This percentage value (120%) and the font size value (16px) of the body element produce the following calculated result values:

16px * 120% = 19.2px

This calculated value will be inherited by the child element.

| Element | Font-size | Line-Height | Calculated Line-Height Value |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

This result will be rendered as shown in the following figure.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/998356405C5CC6D52A)

The important thing about using percentages is that each line-height does not change regardless of the font-size.

#2 Use Length Unit Value

Let`s assume that the `body` element is given 20px in length.

This unit length value (20px) is inherited by the child element, and all the child elements inherit the same `line-height` value regardless of the `font-size` of each element.

| Element | Font-size | Line-Height | Calculated Line-Height Value |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

The above results also show that each line-height does not change regardless of the font-size.

#3 Use normal value

Suppose the normal is approximately 1.2 because each browser has a different default line-height value.

Then, apply `line-height: normal ;` to the `body` element.

If you apply a value of `normal`, the non-calculated value of normal is inherited to the offspring element.
(Note that the value applied when using the normal value may vary slightly from browser to browser)

Normal has different line-height values depending on the font-size of each element.

| Element | Font-size | Line-Height | Calculated Line-Height Value |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

The normal value can be applied this flexible, but is not recommended because there is much room for approximation.

Then, how can I apply it flexibly while using the exact value of the figure?

Here`s how to use the numeric values I`ll explain next.

#4 Use numeric values (units)

Suppose you specify `line-height: 1.5 ;` for the `body` element.

In this case, the argument (1.5) value, which is not a calculated value, is inherited to the offspring element.

This means that each element has a different line-height value depending on its font-size size.

| Element | Font-size | Line-Height | Calculated Line-Height Value |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

Then what is the best way?

Generally, it is best to use a numeric value without units so that the `line-height` value can vary depending on the `font-size` size.

Setting the perfect line spacing for each situation is difficult.
However, heading is better independent of the line-height of the paragraph.

For example, specify all content as 1.5, and then reassign the title as 1.2.

```css
body {
line-height: 1.5;
}
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
line-height: 1.2;
}
```

The Web Accessibility Guide (WCAG) 2.0 defines the line spacing as "at least 1.5 times as large as the space in the paragraph".

This also means that `line-height` in paragraph should be designated as 1.5 as AAA level (recommended).

### Line-Height Deep Learning

From now on, we will study line-height more deeply.

In order to understand `line-height` more clearly, we need to find out the different types of CSS boxes.

You have the following code:

```undefined
<p>
The <em>emphasis</em>
element is defined as
"inline".
</p>
```

The example code above is related to four box types.

- Contingent box
- inline box
- Line box
- content area

containing box

In the example above, the paragraph (p element) acts as a containing box that surrounds other boxes.

inline box

There is a line of inline boxes in the paragraph.

The inline boxes are not arranged in a line-breaking form, but are placed in a single line.

And the highlight of the example code (em) is also an inline box type.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/994836355C5CC74328)

And other boxes that are not marked up in particular will be considered `anonymous online boxes`.

Line box

The in-line box will be seated side by side in the form of a `line box` with the enclosing box.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99B660455C5CC78223)

content area

`content area` refers to a transparent box surrounding text.

The height of the box is determined by `font-size`.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99BC36435C5CC79224)

Each of the boxes we`ve seen so far has a complex effect on `line-height`, so let`s talk about their relationship.

Inline box and line-height

The `line-height` value is applied to the inline box through a simple formula.

When you find the difference between font-size and line-height, the value becomes between rows.

For example, if `font-size: 16px;` and `line-height: 20px;`, the difference would be 4px (between lines).

Then you divide the line in half and find the value between the lines.

4px (between rows) / 2 = 2px (between rows)

This between-travel value is applied by dividing it by the top and bottom of the content area.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99D544425C5CC83823)

However, calculations like these often become more complicated.

Typically, as shown in the picture below, the inline box wraps around the content area and the trailing interval is located above and below the content area.

However, the inline box can sometimes be smaller than the content area.

For example, if `line-height` is less than `font-size`, the inline box will follow the `line-height` value.

This means that if `font-size: 16px;` and `line-height:12px;`, the inline box size will be 12px.

In this case, the content area will pop out from the top and bottom of the inline box, and the recoil will collapse together to occupy the height of the inline box.

Line box and line-height

Furthermore, let`s look at a few things about line box height.

The height of the line box is determined by the largest inline box (or an alternate element).

In other words, anonymous online boxes may be the largest online boxes.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/9998C84E5C5CC86B25)

If not, it may be an inline box with increased line-height.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99234C4A5C5CC89C24)

Otherwise, you may have an inline box with a larger `font-size`.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99DB16425C5CC8AC23)

Alternatively, it may affect the line box even if there is a superscript or a subscripts.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99241A4A5C5CC8C824)

And even if there are alternative elements such as images, they can have the same effect.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/995A6F4F5C5CC8D625)

Line boxes are stacked on top of each other in a containering box.

### at the end

As we`ve seen so far, between lines implies a very complex number of cases.

And it is very difficult to cross-browse line-height accurately.

Due to more complex cases than above, and depending on how OS and browsers render, there is much room for error ranging from 1 to 2px.

For this complex reason, it is not easy to expect perfect line spacing because there are ambiguous margins up and down.

However, at least using the formula for calculating between rows, line-height and font-size differences, you will be able to use more accurate between rows.

The problems between the designers and the lines can also be attributed to the developers` skills, but I hope that at least we can create a better project environment if we understand the web and cooperate with the designers.
