HTML5

Get a quick look at common HTML5 accessibility.

Unfortunately, accessibility often comes into the spotlight amid poor support, poorly crafted applications, and passionate policies leading to `mutual attacks`.

Fortunately, however, W3C`s HTML Design Principles have both practical aspects that are suitable for accessibility 1.

The "universal access" principle refers to access by everyone who is independent of the media and independent of their abilities.

Media independence means that HTML5`s functions should work not only in visual browsers but also in various platforms.

However, access by everyone suggests a more fundamental change in how HTML5 can approach accessibility.

Conventionally, creating easily accessible content depends on how many specific features you use for accessibility, such as `=` and `table summary=`.

Unfortunately, the reality is that these hidden metadata are rarely added, or even if they are added, they are poorly and inaccurate.

Because it is hidden, metadata updates were not made simultaneously whenever the main content was updated.

The fundamental philosophy of HTML5 is to expose meta-data information by moving it to the main content. This is because it is beneficial to all users.

This led from HTML5 specifications to detailed instructions on what we should do to ensure that elements such as images, tables, etc. are fully described, and what should be done first rather than hiding information in properties.

This philosophy can be summarized as follows:

While somewhat cynical, it may be an obvious example of how HTML5 elements, which have built-in semantics, are somehow secretly inspiring web developers to generate content that is automatically accessible.

While good accessibility always requires additional work, you will need to approach these new approaches that significantly improve the criteria for accessibility.

### Slowly evolving techniques of accessibility!

It is important to know that not everyone is enthusiastic about HTML5`s practical position of accepting key products of accessibility, such as summary (now requiring other techniques) and longdesc (now declined) for the <table> element.

However, as long as we stick to HTML5`s Design Principles and focus on access by everyone regardless of ability, we can ignore these arguments.

Changes will affect some of the standardized technologies needed to create accessible content.

Let`s look at the basics that follow.

### alt properties for <img>

HTML5 defines alt as a fallback content, rather than a simple alternative text to the <img> element.

The specification states that alt text must be necessary and an appropriate replacement for the image, except in very specific cases.

However, it may depend on the image application that is appropriate.

- It provides useful information: alt text should convey the same content.
- It performs a function: alt text must convey the function of the image.
- Enhance aesthetics: for example, an image for decorating that does not have any information. Although different from case to case, most decorative images should be left blank alt text (alt="").

```undefined
<img src="/img/albert.jpg" alt=Close the profile of a rhesus monkey looking to the right. The background is blurry, black and white."
```

This is the case for images with descriptive alt text and provides an appropriate structural replacement for the images.

```undefined
<button><img src="/img/log-in-button.png" width="91" height="43" alt="Log in" /></button>
```

This is the case of an image that contains the content of button as alt text.

```undefined
<img src="/img/decorative.png" width="64" height="24" alt="" />
```

This is only an image for decoration. Empty alt=""" is appropriate because no information is provided.

In certain cases, the HTML5 specification states that empty alt text should be used:

- An example is "figcaption" when the surrounding content already describes a description of the image, to avoid repetition.
- If it is a part of a large image! This is if the image of the other part already contains the appropriate alt text for all images.

As we have already mentioned in the alt text example of the decorative image, the HTML5 specification emphasizes that you must use alt="" in the following situations:

- When the image is only for decoration. These decorative images provide no function or information beyond the function of aesthetic representation.
- When it`s a hidden image. Width and height should be set to `0`.
- This is when an icon or logo is side by side next to a text with the same meaning.

This means that you can have completely different alt text or blank alt="" depending on where the image is used and what you plan to deliver.

We can also use the ARIA attribute `aria-describedby=`". This is to create a clear semantic association between the image and its description in the content.

However, generally speaking of the context of the text, this is not necessary.

Remember that alt text is an alternative content, not a caption or title for an image.

If you need captions or additional explanation of the image, you can use `figuration` and `figcaptions` that have the same original semantics as `aria-labeledby`, or use the title property.

Examine an example of an image that has both the alternative content provided in the alt property and the captioned in `figcaptions`.

```undefined
<figure>
img src="/img/albert.jpg" alt="Close the profile of a rhesus monkey looking to the right. The background is blurry, black and white."/>
£figcaption id="albert" before a historic trip into space on June 14, 1949.
</figure>
```

When you put alt text, imagine describing a page to someone on the phone.

### Missing longdesc property

The property `longdesc` was intended to provide links to isolated pages that had more information about the original image.

It`s basically hidden content (almost never used), and it`s also a property that wasn`t used correctly, so it`s no longer useful in HTML5.

This means that even if this property already exists in the content, it remains the same in terms of browser support.

However, HTML5 specifications are urging you not to use longdesc properties, and HTML5 inspectors will receive error messages.

The recommended HTML5 alternative is to add this content to the current page. You can use `aria-describedby="" to connect.

This property can move the description of the image away from the image.

If the description of the image cannot be included in the current page, you can use the `<a` element to link to the page you are describing. Anyway, it`s the same as longdesc`s function.

This will make it easy for all users, not just those who use the assistive device, to access the content.

### Summary properties of stale but compliant <table>

First, how should I interpret it?

Yes, the useless function is that the validator receives an error message, while the useless but compliant function is that it only receives a warning message.

So, you can`t just cut "do not use it" and make a decision. However, the message I want to deliver remains unchanged.

The `summary` property was specifically designed to provide a detailed description of `table` to assistive device users.

However, the reality is not much different from how `longdesc` is used. HTML5 recommends that this description text be transferred to the main content, and the hard-to-understand table should be introduced as a description.

It can be used in a wide variety of ways in the surrounding content, such as in <captions>, in <captions>, in <details>, in <fig> and so on.

However, the ideal solution is to adjust the `table` layout and `headings` that make it easier to understand.

So there will be no need for explanation.

The following is an example of a comparison table between HTML5 elements and ARIA landmark rolls.

This table is clear enough to use the elements `captions`, `the head` and `scope` without further explanation.

```undefined
<table id="mapping-html5-to-aria-landmark">
<caption>
abARIA <abbr> Landmark Rolls for each structural element in HTML5
</caption>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">HTML5 요소</th>
<th scope="col"><abbr>ARIA</abbr> Landmark role</th>
<th scope="col">Notes</th>
</tr>
</thead>
</tbody>
..........
..........
</table>
```

### at the end

Other areas of HTML5 accessibility (especially new elements such as `video`, `audio` and `canvas`) are still actively underway.

The challenge to the issue of accessibility continues, as W3C HTML Design Principles states, "Access by everyone is the most basic regardless of ability."

As important to us as the founder of HTML5 is to achieve these goals rather than to use specificized technologies.

Along with the built-in semantics and the principle of media independence of new elements, HTML5 is naturally already more accessible than it was before.

And even though well-organized HTML5 doesn`t necessarily require WAI-ARIA, the ability to use it is also more accessible to the extent that it is not required to override the built-in semantics of HTML5.

What we need now is the support of the user agent.
