Synchronous Processing Model vs Asynchronous Processing Model

I would like to inform you that this is an excerpt of an article about synchronous processing model vs asynchronous processing model.

### Synchronous processing model

Synchronous processing models perform tasks in series.
In other words, tasks are executed sequentially, and if any task is being performed, the next task is queued.

For example, when data is imported from a server and displayed on the screen, subsequent tasks are blocked until data is requested from the server and the data is answered.

Synchronous processing model

The following is synchronously operated code, executed sequentially.

```js
function func1() {
console.log('func1');
func2();
}

function func2() {
console.log('func2');
func3();
}

function func3() {
console.log('func3');
}

func1();


```

### Asynchronous Processing Model
(Asynchronous processing model 또는 Non-Blocking processing model)

The asynchronous processing model (also known as the Non-Blocking processing model) performs tasks in parallel.
This means that even if the task is not terminated, the next task is executed without waiting.
For example, when performing a task that retrieves data from a server and displays it on the screen, the following task is performed immediately (non-Blocking) without waiting for data to be answered from the server after requesting data from the server. Subsequently, when data is answered from the server, events occur and the event handler continues to perform tasks with the data.

Most DOM events in JavaScript, as well as the Timer function (setTimeout, setInterval), and Ajax requests work as as an asynchronous processing model.

Asynchronous processing model

The code below is a code that operates asynchronously. It is not executed sequentially.

```js
function func1() {
console.log('func1');
func2();
}

function func2() {
setTimeout(function() {
console.log('func2');
}, 0);

func3();
}

function func3() {
console.log('func3');
}

func1();


```

When you run the example above, the console does not output logs in the order of "func1 func2 func3" even if the setTimeout method sets the second argument interval to 0 seconds.
This is because the setTimeout method is an asynchronous function.

The setItmeout method is an asynchronous function.

When function func1 is called, function func1 is stacked in Call Stack.
Since function func1 calls function func2, function func2 is stacked in Call Stack and setTimeout is called.
The callback function in setTimeout does not run immediately, waits for a specified wait time, then moves to the event queue when the "tick" event occurs, then moves to Call Stack when the Call Stack is empty.
