Take a look at how to extract thumbnails based on the shared source in your Vimeo video and point out what`s relevant to cross-browsing. In this article, we used JavaScript, which is easier to access if you use a server script.

### Vimeo Video VID Extraction

Suppose a Vimeo video was inserted somewhere as shown below. Most multimedia services require extraction of this VID value to distinguish images with their own ID values (VIDs) and to classify each information.

```html
<iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/9873789" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen=""></iframe>

```

Among the inserted video source codes (iframes), non-meo videos filter out regular expressions based on the special strings they have.

```js
var vurl = $('iframe').attr('src').match(/player.vimeo.com\/video\/?([0-9]+)/i);

```

The selected non-meo video extracts the VID by truncating the string.

```js
var vidStr = vurl.indexOf("video/");
var vid = vurl.slice(vidStr+6);

```

### Request json data via Ajax

We use extracted VID values to access json data, an API provided by Vimeo, through Ajax.

```js
var ajaxUrl = 'http://vimeo.com/api/v2/video/'+vid+'.json';
$.ajax({
url: ajaxUrl,
dataType: "json"
})

```

Vimeo supports both json and xml formats, allowing data to be requested in any way. However, it is awkward that requesting an xml format causes redirection in selecting elements internally. Since json also automatically parses the data requested by jQuery Ajax requests into the json format, data requests fail under IE7 which does not support them. This can be dealt with using json2.js.

Another trick in responding to IE7 while using the json format is to use the jsonp format. This is frequently used as a bypass to cross-domain policies, which must have settings related to the remote server, and Vimeo has these settings.

```js
var ajaxUrl = 'http://vimeo.com/api/v2/video/'+vid+'.json';
$.ajax({
url: ajaxUrl,
dataType: "jsonp",
jsonp: "callback"
})

```

Looking at the json data provided by Vimeo, we can see the key:value associated with the thumbnail.

```json
[{
...
"thumbnail_small":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/50115370_100x75.jpg",
"thumbnail_medium":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/50115370_200x150.jpg",
"thumbnail_large":"https:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/50115370_640.jpg",
...
}]

```

```js
$.ajax({
url: ajaxUrl,
dataType: "json"

}).done(function (data) {
var vsrc = data[0]['thumbnail_large'];
$('.thumbnail').append('<img src="'+vsrc+'">');

}).fail(function (data) {
alert('Bimeo Thumbnail extraction failed!');
});

```

It is possible to obtain a thumbnail of a non-meo video in approximately the same way, and it is possible without having to issue an API key.

### Vimeo API

Vimeo provides an API that provides various information needed to create Vimeo applications. To use vimeo developer, you must register a non-meo account and the application you want to use and obtain a key.
