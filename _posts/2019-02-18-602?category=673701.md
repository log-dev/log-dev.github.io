Traditional web application development had to be developed differently for each browser because JavaScript and DOM handled differently. However, since the 2010s, JS libraries such as jQuery and Underscore.js, which have been a cross-browser, have emerged, and web application development is turning point, and then single web frameworks such as Backbone.js, Ember.js, AngularJs, do not change page requests to a server.

Vue.js is a front-end web framework that has emerged as an extension of this evolutionary process.
Unlike the libraries and single web frameworks we introduced earlier, they have the advantage of being partially applicable to traditional web applications.
In other words, it can effectively integrate other JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and CSSs by focusing on the representation of a web page, also known as a "view layer."

### Vue.js Birth Background

Vue.js was developed by Evan Yu, who worked for Google Creative Labs.
Google has already developed a single-type web framework, Angula JS, which gives users an advanced program experience, but Angular JS was not an easy-to-learn framework for web application developers.
One of the advantages of AngularJS is the development of bi-directional data binding (a concept that combines changes in data into a template to update the screen and then updates the data according to input on the screen), which Vue.js founder Evando AngularJS has seen as an advantage.
When Evan made Vue.js, I thought, "Isn`t Angular JS able to create a light library with only my favorite characteristics?" and I wanted to create a web framework that was easier to access. React.js is currently a popular front-end web framework with Vue.js, but it is important to use `ECMAScript 6 (hereinafter ES6)` and to add programs developed with React.js to the website under development, it is difficult to create and build a separate project.
This makes it difficult to integrate efficiently with existing web applications. In contrast, Vue.js supports a component development approach based on Web components published in WebComponents 2014 to help reuse HTML and DOMs.
Developing web applications using Vue.js can provide users with a superior user experience and developers can gain development efficiency.

### Virtual DOM Method

The method of developing and using web applications is Web 2.0 (a web technology that produces information directly by users based on the spirit of openness, participation, and sharing) It`s different from before. The web application was to receive page or image information requested by the browser to the web server, verify form input data, or represent simple animations, but after Web 2.0, JavaScript was able to receive and represent new data from the web server without refreshing the web page, and modify the DOM dynamically with JavaScript.
It`s easier to create web pages that are more beautiful than ever.

So I started to think that if we were to treat certain parts of the web application with one complete DOM, the browser wouldn`t handle the entire DOM of the web page, so we could reduce the burden. The result of implementing this is `virtual DOM`.

Let`s take a look at how JavaScript works with web pages.
For example, suppose you have the following HTML pages:

```undefined
<html>
<head>
<title>HTML DOM</title>
</head>
<body>
You must use DOM to access 합니다HTML.</p>
</body>
</html>

```

Since the child element of the body element is one p element, you can expect the number of body element childNodes in the DOM to be one.
Create and import the js file and check the code below in your browser console.

```js
var dom = document.querySelector('body');
console.log(dom.childNodes);

// Run Results
// NodeList(3) [text, p, text]

```

Contrary to expectations, we will recognize 3 child elements. This is because when a browser reads HTML documents into a DOM structure, it sees open or blank spaces (including tabs) as a single DOM element.
DOM recognizes multiple rows or spaces as #text nodes. The html tag is also an element. The above web page has very few elements, but the average web page has tens to tens of thousands of elements.
DOM manipulation in web pages is not just about modifying one element, but about manipulating multiple DOM elements in JavaScript at once.

However, if a DOM operation occurs simultaneously or at a time difference, the browser must navigate from the top of the DOM to the element that is the target of the operation in order to process the DOM operation.
This is inefficient and even in the process of processing events that occur in DOM, the higher the number of elements, the slower the processing speed is.
Virtual DOMs allow Web applications to access only individual virtual DOMs, which speeds up processing.
`Vue.js` compares the contents of the virtual DOM with the contents of the web page when the virtual DOM changes, and updates the contents of the virtual DOM if the web page has a different DOM. `React.js` also uses virtual DOMs.

With virtual DOMs, we can efficiently update web pages, so we expect more web frameworks to use these virtual DOMs in the future. W3C, which defines web standards, is also interested in virtual DOMs, and has been working on Shadow DOMs [which effectively encapsulate elements (including child elements) in DOMs with W3C`s virtual DOM standards and are only available in Chrome 53 and later versions as of March 2018] since the draft was published.

As many browsers begin to implement Shadow DOM, the JavaScript framework, which implements virtual DOM individually, is also expected to change its implementation to `Shadow DOM`.

### Advantages of Vue.js

The reason why Vue.js has become a framework that many people use in a short time is not just that it is easy to use, but Vue.js has the advantage of templates and scalability compared to React.js using virtual DOMs.
The downside is that large web applications are difficult to implement and the ecosystem is smaller than React.js.

Templates

Vue.js takes advantage of existing HTML templates by displaying data from Vue instances or components.(CSS covered by components also uses existing grammar)
This enables partial integration of vue.js code into existing web applications.
React.js uses JSX, a template syntax that transforms HTML as a way of representing data in an instance. Although it is popular as a way to effectively express user elements, it is also burdensome to learn separately even for a short time.

Scalability

Most web applications consist of 10 to 20 web pages and often use a variety of libraries and frameworks to add dynamic capabilities.
Among them, libraries such as jQuery can be easily used by adding `CDN` as a script tag.

Vue.js can also add `CDN` as a script tag, such as jQuery. CDN is a hosting service that lets you use the JavaScript framework or library directly for web applications.
Vue.js also allows you to select and use the libraries that you need to accommodate the growing size of your programs.
For example, you can use Vuex to deal with the status of a Vue.js-based web application later, and if you need to develop a single-page web application, you can use Vue-router.
Bundling build tools required to develop dynamic web applications such as webpack and parcel allow you to distribute your work to websites.
You can also use Grunt, gulp to automate build operations that handle only JavaScript files separately.

### Conclusion

We`ve learned the background and benefits of Vue.js.
From now on, we will learn about the key concepts of Vue.js, including the Vue.js development environment.
