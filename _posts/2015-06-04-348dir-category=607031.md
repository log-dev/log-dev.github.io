### display

Specifies how elements are displayed.

```css
p.inline {display: inline;}

```

- inline : express like an inline element.
- block : expresses like a block element.
- inline-block: flows in-line, but like block boxes, margin, border, padding, width, and height properties are applied.
- flex : A new value in CSS3 represents an element like a block-level flex container.
- Inline-flex: A new value in CSS3 represents an element like an inline-level flex container.
- list-item: Block the box and process the items in it in an inline box.
- run-in: processed into blocks or inline boxes according to context.
- Table, inline-table, , table-captions, table-cell, table-column, table-column-group, table-header-group, table-footer-group, table-row, table-row-group: These properties define the behavior of table-style elements.
- none : blocks are not created. This completely disappears from the screen and does not occupy any space.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.display="block"

```

### visibility

Determines whether to render the box generated by the element. By default, this value is inherited. The invisible box affects the layout unless the display attribute is specified as none.

```css
h2 {visibility: hidden;}

```

- Visible: The box is shown.
- Hidden: The box is invisible, but it still affects the layout because it frees up space.
- collapse: Applies to internal table objects (rows, row groups, columns, and column groups). It is similar to "hidden.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.
