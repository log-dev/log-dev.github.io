Setting this value using call() or apply()

The value of this usually depends on the context in which the function was invoked (except when using the new keyword).

However, when calling a function using `apply()` or `call()`, you can manipulate (control) the value of this by specifying the object to reference.

In other words, this method calls JavaScript, "JS, call X function." But for the X function, it`s like telling you to use Z object as this value.

This approach allows you to override the value of this immediately set in JavaScript.

### call()

The following code defines one object and one function, then calls the function using call(), and lets you use myObj as this value inside the function.

The internal statements of the myFn function will now be able to set properties for myObj, not for global objects.

As such, the value referenced by this (here within myFn) can be replaced by another object.

```js
var myObj = {};

var myFn = function (param1, param2) {
// call() to call the function and set 'this' to point to myObj.
this.foo = param1;
this.bar = param2;
console.log(this); // Object {foo = 'foo', bar = 'bar'} 가 기록된다
};

Call the // function and set myObj to this.
myFn.call(myObj, 'foo', 'bar')

console.log(myObj); // Object {foo = 'foo', bar = 'bar'} 가 기록된다
```

### apply()

In the example above, you used call(), but you can also use apply()

The only difference between call() and apply() is to pass the parameter to the function.

When using call(), parameters must be passed separately by commas, but when using apply(), values must be passed by inserting them into the array.

The following is the code that modified call() to apply() in the example above:

```js
var myObj = {};

var myFn = function (param1, param2) {
// use apply() to call the function and set 'this' to point to myObj.
this.foo = param1;
this.bar = param2;
console.log(this); // Object {foo = 'foo', bar = 'bar'} 가 기록된다
};

Call the // function and set myObj to this.
MyFn.apply (myObj, ['foo', 'bar']); // parameter transfer is an array.

console.log(myObj); // Object {foo = 'foo', bar = 'bar'} 가 기록된다
```
