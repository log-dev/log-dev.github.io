Web statistics programs tend to provide different results with different purposes. Below we give you advice on improving your understanding of the programs and choosing what you want based on the results reflected.

### Program Features

Google Analytics requires the administrator`s authority to operate the server because it requires Webalizer and AWStat to be installed directly on the web server.

Google Analytics collects data from visitors` browsers and Webalizer and AWStat collects data from installed web servers.

### To aggregate the number of visitors

If you look at the aggregation method of each comparable program, you can see the difference.

1. Anyone can easily install it if the website owner uses CMS such as WordPress (such as History in Korea) to add a special code to each page. However, it may be inaccurate if it is not installed on all pages.

2. Even if Google Analytics is installed on all pages, Google Analytics may not have the opportunity to run if the website is slow to load. This can happen if the Google Analytics code is located at the bottom.

3. Data will not be collected if visitors prohibit the use of JavaScript code in the browser`s settings.

4. Google Analytics also uses cookies to obtain information, which can lead to inaccurate data if visitors delete cookies or prohibit the use of cookies.

5. Google Analytics does not record search engine bots and other crawlers visited the site, so it does not confuse aggregating actual visitors. However, this means that in order to examine the bots and active bandwidth, the server`s logs must be searched.

6. Google Analytics calculates with a 30-minute delay for repeat visitors.

7. Not everyone wants Google Analytics to run in a visitor`s browser, but if an existing synchronous Google code is inserted at the bottom of every web page in production, it may not load before visitors leave, so a new asynchronous code should be used to resolve it.

It is a good tool for website owners to use when they run their markets online or when they are curious about visitors` behavior. It is good to analyze where visitors come from, how often they stop by, what they do on the site, what kind of contents they look for, and where they leave the site and head to. This information will also help optimize for marketing and sales.

1. AWStats defines visitors by analyzing the log files of the web server only with IP addresses and user agents. For example, a visitor with a single IP address using an agent such as FireFox visits several pages and understands it as a real connection of visitors rather than a bot. But if user agent is a Google bot, it will be neither a bot nor a visitor.

2. However, some bots will not identify themselves (without revealing), and AWStats will not be able to identify everything, although they will try to find them in a database of known bots. Sometimes bots will be counted as real visitors, and if they connect to multiple different IPs in the same session, they will also be counted as real visitors. Also, if visitors see a page of content stored in the browser cache, they will not count it as the number of visitors even after a few days.

3. You can see how much bandwidth various bots and crawlers used and where they came from. It is useful for exploring who crawls the site and which visitors it is.

4. Usually, if the bot is not correctly identified, the number of visitors is overrepresented because it is mistaken for actual visitor access.

AWStats is not a marketing tool. However, it helps you understand the number of visitors, bots, and bandwidth used. Hotlinks can also detect bandwidth using documents or images on websites.

This tool is for network administrators rather than marketers. AWStats can`t help the website`s goals and effective SEO, marketing campaigns.

1. Webalizer interprets log files on a web server like AWStats. The number of visitors increased more than other programs because there is no difference between bot and actual visitors. This is why sometimes people are confused by the rapid drop in visitors when they use Google Analytics while using Webalizer.

2. Webalizer is set to visit for 30 minutes, so many visitors are recorded.

Like AWStats, it is not a marketing tool. It provides simple results and shows an amazing number of visitors because it does not distinguish bot from actual visitors.
