About HTML

HTML means the markup language for web pages.

Then, what is a web page?

A web page is an individual document on the World Wide Web.

It is often called simply `Web`.

This document is also a strictly web page, so if you`re currently reading it, you`re `looking at the web page`.

The term web is often synonymous with the Internet, but strictly speaking, it is a different concept.

The name "Internet" is an attempt to implement a network to connect all computers within a single network.

It was originally named the Internet by short, and has an etymology.

You do not need to be familiar with these concepts in detail, but if you want to study this field, it would be good to know the background knowledge.

### DTD for creating HTML documents

To create HTML, a document type is essential.

The document type is called DTD, and the DOCTYPE or Document Type Definition (DTD) must be declared at the top of the document.

These document-type definitions include HTML5, HTML4, and XHTML, which are the criteria for handling elements and attributes of markup documents according to the type described, which is also used for validation.

Depending on DOCTYPE`s version-specific declaration (HTML5, HTML4, XHTML), HTML has slightly different tags that it supports.

And it is located at the top of the HTML document because it is not a DOCTYPE tag but a declaration.

It also features no DOCTYPE exit tag and `<!DOCTYPE>` is not a component of HTML documents.

The document below is the default HTML4 document type.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<meta http-equiv="Content-Script-Type" content="text/javascript">
<meta http-equiv="Content-Style-Type" content="text/css">
>HTML 4.01 Document Type</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/service_name.css">
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```

As shown above, document type designation is specified at the top, where PUBLIC creates a URI in the W3C standard according to document type, with DTD open to the public (all users).

In addition, if you omit the URI, the page is rendered in quark mode.

The dock type is to pre-declare which version of HTML was created, so that the web browser can display the content correctly.

And right after that, the html tag comes, and inside the html tag is largely divided into `head` and `body`.

Tags typically consist of a start tag and an end (end) tag, and some are exceptional.

You must also specify the language that the document will cover as a property of the `html` tag.

Language settings are required properties and should not be omitted.

Although there is no content to express contents in `head`, it will include contents to express contents.

The above `meta` (information describing the document itself) specifies that information about the document (a summary of the web page) is given to the browser and search engine to tell them what information this document has.

In other words, it contains information describing the document itself, such as the key keywords of the document, who made it, and the character set (language setting) that contains information such as what is being used.

The meta-information in the code above defines three (character sets) of the languages that the actual document covers.

The `title` displays information about the document in the browser.

`link` is called an external file.

Finally, you create content that is represented on the web page in the body area of the document, or `body` tag, which means the content area.

### DOCTYPE Version Information

DTD = Document Type Definition = Document Type Declaration = HTML Version Information

To create a valid HTML document, HTML version information must be specified.

HTML 4.01 Document Type

The HTML 4.01 Transitional DTD

- Include de-prescribed elements and properties in the Strict DTD.
- You can use this declaration for backward compatibility when you need to include elements or attributes that are not recommended in the document.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
```

The HTML 4.01 Strict DTD

- It is the most stringent DTD except for elements de-prescribed and ition related elements and attributes in Traditional DTD.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```

The HTML 4.01 Frameset DTD

- Transitionl Include frameset in the DTD. This declaration must be used in documents with Frameset applied.
- The most loose document format.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">
```

The XHTML 1.0 Document Type

The XHTML 1.0

- In XHTML 1.0, you can use one of three DTDs, similar to the DTD in HTML 4.01.
- It is similar to HTML, but has a more strict grammar.
- Application of XML

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd">
```

The XHTML 1.1

- You can define only one DTD in HTML 1.1.
- This is based on the existing XHTML 1.0 Strict DTD.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
```
