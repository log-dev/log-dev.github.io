When creating a page that requires IE7 consideration, it is often difficult because it does not support virtual selectors such as :before or :after. To make matters worse, we don`t even support content properties. We`re looking for alternative ways to do this.

### :before, :after Alternative to selectors

IE7 uses a method to create and assign class names to replace the `:before` and `:after` virtual selectors. As shown below, the expression creates elements in the same way as JavaScript.

```css
.example:before,
.example .ie-before {
display:block;
width: 100px;
height: 50px;
}

.example {
*zoom: expression(
this.runtimeStyle['zoom'] = '1',
thisinsertBefore(document.createElement("i"),
thisfirstChild).className="ie-before"
);
}

```

For application only in IE7, the entity uses a `*` nucleus and positions the elements produced as the first child of the selected element. Of course, the above methods may differ from their intended accessibility by producing elements that do not really want to exist.

The method of generating the :after selector is similar, and only the instruction of the expression changes.

```css
.example {
*zoom: expression(
this.runtimeStyle['zoom'] = '1',
this.appendChild(document.createElement("i")).className="ie-after"
);
}

```

### Content Property Replacement Plan

IE7 also does not support the content property of the CSS. This is a frequently used property with virtual selectors, so we also look at how to replace it. This is done at the level of simply adding instructions to the IE-only expression used above.

```css
.love {
*zoom: expression(
this.runtimeStyle['zoom'] = '1',
thisinnerHTML = 'LOVE'
);
}

```

It is a method of outputting inside a real element with inner HTML. Most content properties are used to express content that will be inserted using virtual selectors such as :before or :after.

### Example of combining content properties with the :before selector

Write the code to work with both IE7 and other browsers.

```html
<p class="welcome">World!</p>

<style>
.welcome:before,
.welcome .ie-before {
content: "Hello~";
margin-right: 5px;
}

.welcome {
*zoom: expression(
this.runtimeStyle['zoom'] = '1',
thisinsertBefore(document.createElement("i"),
thisfirstChild).className="ie-before"
thisfirstChild.innerHTML = "Hello~"
);
}
</style>

```

For essential elements that need to be considered and cannot be omitted, consider using this expression to achieve the desired objective.
