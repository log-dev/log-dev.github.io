JavaScript consists of three components:

### JavaScript BOM

The JavaScript Browser Object Model (BOM) consists of objects associated with the browser and provides a means of programmatically controlling the browser.

- Window
- Navigator
- Location
- History
- Document
- Screen

BOM is like learning how to use a Window object to control it using the properties and methods of a Window object, a global object.

### JavaScript DOM

The JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM) is a browser manufacturer`s own technology that implements the rules (interfaces) that must be followed when manipulating web documents. The Web standard follows the W3C DOM interface, and in older IE7 and 8, there are parts that are not supported.

- Element Control Unit
- Style Control Unit
- Attribute Control Unit
- Event Control Part

After the browser parses the HTML Web document, it converts the DOM object to match it 1:1 with the node written in the document and outputs it on the screen. Although the structure is invisible, the concept is abstractly understood, approached and available.

### JavaScript Core

It includes the basic grammar and structure of JavaScript, data types, conditional statements, antagonisms, functions, and basic libraries. This is the basic grammar that we learn when we learn new programming.
