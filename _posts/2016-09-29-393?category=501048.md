Control access to members in object-oriented languages

Common object-oriented languages provide qualifiers such as public and private to control access to members.

However, JavaScript does not provide language-specific keywords for controlling access to members and hiding information.

The public property in JavaScript is the same as the variable that has the value directly.

Therefore, the internal state of the object is exposed as it is through properties.

This means that it does not "hide information."

Sometimes you want to create a private member so that you don`t have direct access to the value from the outside, although you may want to expose the value of the variable to the outside world.

However, JavaScript does not support creating these private members, so developers must implement them themselves.

Here are two special patterns for access control.

### Implement private members

Here is the first way to implement a private member.

The region variables of the function are private variables that cannot be accessed externally, so these region variables only need to have the state value of the object.

The problem is that public members cannot directly access private variables.

Therefore, the public member must have an internal function that can access the internal variable and use this function to access the internal state value.

It looks like this when I organize my teeth.

You use the internal local variable as the state value of the object, and the external access method uses the public method, but the public method defines and uses the internal function that accesses the local variable.

This means that an internal function exists between the state value and the published external method.

The following is an example of a published property that uses this internal variable and its corresponding dedicated function.

```js
function A() {
// Internal Region Variables (Status Values)
var _localX = 7;

// Public Access Method
this.getX = function() {
return _localX;
};

// Only the number less than 10 is entered as a property value.
this.setX = function (x) {
if( x < 10 ) {
_localX = x;
}
return _localX;
}
}
```

You have defined the public methods for read, write-only, getX, setX of local variables _localX.

In getX, setX, anonymous functions are used internally to access region variables again.

If the structure is accessed through an internal defined function without accessing the state value of a direct property, it can be processed and passed as needed when returning the internal state value, and when assigning a value, it can be processed or validated before changing the state value.

The above code specified a condition that the value assigned to the internal state variable must be less than 10.

You can now create an object for A and then access the value through the public method as follows:

```js
function A() {
// Internal Region Variables (Status Values)
var _localX = 7;

// Public Access Method
this.getX = function() {
return _localX;
};

// Only the number less than 10 is entered as a property value.
this.setX = function (x) {
if( x < 10 ) {
_localX = x;
}
return _localX;
};
}

var obj = new A();
var x = obj.getX();
console.log(x); // output a value of 7 for _localX
set 8 to console.log(obj.setX (8)); // output 8 to localX
console.log(obj.setX(11); // output 8'
```

obj.setX(11) does not meet internal conditions, so 11 is not assigned and 8 is returned, which is the value of the previously assigned obj.setX(8)

### Closer Instances

We now introduce a patterned technique for implementing objects with private and public members.

This technique allows JavaScript to create objects with structures similar to objects in general object-oriented languages.

The JavaScript closure is a "creator of a function instance that can have private variables."

If you are not familiar with the closure, please understand and read it.

Here we will use the closure to create objects with private members.

Private object definitions can be designed as private members, public members.

Define a closure called outer that allows you to create objects with public, private member structures as follows:

```js
function outer() {
// Private Members
var _x = 0;

function _private01() {
return ++_x;
}

function _private02() {
return (_x += 2);
}

// Public members (external disclosure through returned objects)
return {
public01 : _private01,
public02 : _private02
};
}
```

`_private01()` and `_private02()` are internal functions that increase the internal variable _x by one or two, respectively, and functions public01 and public02 that invoke these internal functions are externally disclosed through the object returned by the return statement.

The internal _x value remains as long as the object returned by the return statement does not go out and disappear.

The internal variable _x is initialized for each object returned each time the closure outer is called.

The following example code calls the previously defined outer to create and execute objects:

```js
'varobj1 = outer(); // create instance obj1
console.log(obj1.public01()); // 1 output
console.log(obj1.public02()); // 3 output

varobj2 = outer(); // create instance obj2 (the new instance is initialized with _x)
console.log(obj2.public01()); // 1 output
console.log(obj2.public02()); // 3 output'
```

Invoke outer() to assign the generated object to obj1.

When you call public01 to increase the value by 1, the previously increased value is maintained when public02 is called, making it the starting value of the second call.

The internal variable scope object takes advantage of the properties of the closure that remain intact even when the outer function call ends.

Once again, call outer() to assign a new instance to obj2, and then public01, public02 to see the results indicate that the new internal variable _x was initialized, creating a new instance with a closed environment different from the previous closure.

Calling a closure does not simply return an object. The object and the closed space associated with it are returned together.

And there is an internal variable in that closed space.

You can create multiple instances of closed space repeatedly by using closers and () just as you use classes and new to create multiple instances of closed space.

In other words, closures can be seen as class-like beings.

The closure instance using the outer function above is the creation of an instance with variable space independent of obj1 and obj2.

Therefore, generation through closures is conceptually almost the same as generation through classes.
