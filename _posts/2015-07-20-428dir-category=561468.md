After detecting the change in values for form validation, we were working on receiving events to validate them and displaying error messages. I wanted to receive a value that changes in real time, and after looking at the types and functions of the event, I came to a conclusion to share the contents.

### Events used during form validation

When verifying form, `blur` events that occur when values are entered in the input field and focus is released are used a lot. In most cases, it is a valid method, but returning to a completed field is a hassle for the user. In some cases, it is necessary to validate the moment the key is entered. Like the example below.

During validation of the membership form, the password and password re-entry were being processed. If the value is different compared to the pre-populated password and the re-entering part, an error message should be displayed, but the re-entering part of the password should be displayed compared to the password in real time.

I knew at first glance that there is a `change` as an event that has a similar function, but this event also occurs when the focus is released, so I passed it~ I searched more and recommended a `keyup` event. This is an event that occurs when the keyboard is pressed and released. First of all, the desired purpose was an event that occurs when typing a password, so the goal could be achieved.

I tried to finish it because it worked. There was a trap here. duplication

When I tried to paste using a mouse (using a contact menu), I couldn`t receive any events. What`s interesting is that when you use a on-screen keyboard, it has the same result as when you press it with your mouse but receive keyboard input.

Of course, problems can be solved if `keyup` event and `blur` event are received together. Even if you paste it with a mouse, it`ll be verified as soon as you lose focus.

### input Introduction to the event

`input` event is an event that occurs synchronously when a value is changed in input or textarea element. This is an immediate event that occurs as soon as the value changes, which also works on both the keyboard and input using other devices. Whether you paste or do something, an event occurs when an input occurs.

It works with all modern browsers, but IE9 is an event that contains bugs and does not work under IE8.

### input event polyfill

We found a polyfill that resolves the bugs in IE9 and replaces the input events that work until IE8.

This plugin abstracts differences between browsers and provides a synthetic event called `textchange` that mimics `input` events in all browsers. If you look into the code, there are detailed annotations.

> I didn't understand the concept of abstract painting, so I looked it up and found the following statement.

Generalization: extracting common points from different objects to create new objects. For example, if boys and girls are generalized, they can be generalized to the concept of students.

Abstract: extracting (or hiding) only the parts of interest from a real object and ignoring (or hiding) the rest. A typical example of abstraction is a subway map. The subway map is an extract of the location relationship of each subway station from the actual subway map.
Generalization and Abstraction

After inserting jQuery, you can call the plug-in and use it as if using other jQuery events.

```js
$("#monkey").on("textchange", function() {
// ...
});

```

An event occurs to any change in value that occurs with user input, which can be received. Basically, only `type="text" and `type="password" of input elements are checked for events. The revised version below also checks for textarea events.

> It is a plug-in that started with the same concerns as I did and got the results. A trace of his agony can be found in A year-perfect oninput shim for IE 8 and 9.

The source source may not be managed, but another user has distributed a version that has added some bugs and features.

textchange v1.2 alpha2

- Group all updates to a target element together and defer `textchange` event triggering to the next tick using `setTimeout(..., 0)`
Fixes cursor reset in `textarea` when `textchange` event handler sets a `value`
Reduces number of `textchange` notifications during drag
- Fixes cursor reset in `textarea` when `textchange` event handler sets a `value`
- Reduces number of `textchange` notifications during drag
- Support drag
- When text is moved from one element to another via drag
- Reduce use of `activeElement`
- Permanently override `value`, not just when element has focus
- Add version information (currently random choice of `1.2 alpha1`)
- Tested in IE8 on Windows XP, IE9 on Win7 (both using ModernIE VM), simulated IE8 and IE9 mode in IE11 on Windows 8.1, Chrome and Firefox

A textchange event is fired the first time an element is focused (even though focusing did not change the value)
