One of the plugins that validate the form is a jQuery plugin called Parsley. Considering the design aspect, I thought it would be easy to use the class on the DOM, so I translated the related documents and revised them and wrote the contents below. Please refer to it.

Each input form in a form, such as `input`, `textarear`, and `select`, is called a field.

### Introducing Parsley

The parsley described here is not edible parsley, but a form verification library made with JavaScript. If you search in real life, only parsley you eat will be searched, so please search Parsley js. The purpose of the use is to provide users with feedback on the form they created before submitting the form to the server, reducing server load and saving users time spent on form verification.

JavaScript form verification is not essential, and using it does not replace validation of a strong backend server. We recommend using general form validation on the front end to maximize the user experience and provide accurate inspection on the back end.

Parsley uses a special DOM API (data-* support) that allows it to set everything up directly in the DOM without having to create a JavaScript syntax for init, such as common JavaScript plugins. Parsley`s default DOM API is `data-parsley-`, which sets the plug-in with a variety of specified attributes and values that follow this phrase, or with their own attributes and values.

This means that it can be set as in `data-parsley-foo="value" via DOM to refer to the foo attribute in the setup.

Parsley is rather intelligent, so he automatically detects modifications to the form and validates them accordingly. Simply add, remove, and modify fields and parsley will validate them!

> When you actually use it, you see that what parsley automatically detects works based on the attributes you have written in the field. For example, if you add 'required' to the input field, you will be aware that it must be entered as required, and without any other action, you will be able to validate the situation accordingly. This list related to verification which is integral with the parsley and are "`, ` type email", type url ", said : " `, and said : " `, ` and ` pattern already be filled out of the verification and the list.Will qualify automatically when it has to work.

As mentioned above, a dozen useful validation lists are provided that are pre-written and included, and additional Ajax validation and other validation lists are being distributed from Parsley downloads.

Parsley has a powerful mechanism for leading UI and UX. Almost all parsley`s basic behavior can be overridden to accommodate the needs of developers who will utilize it.

> It's one of my favorite parts. By default, the '<ul>' element is added as a sibling to the field that is validated to show the error message, which also adds classes to the field that will reflect the validation success and failure. These are the default values and you can add error messages to any location, and you can add success or failure classes to any location. It was designed to consider the design.

### View Parsley Example

Let`s take a look at examples that work directly.

A form example that applies parsley-supported binding, setup, and validation to its elements.

Sometimes, basic supported validation alone is not sufficient. We present a reliable way to utilize parsley events.

Sometimes, long and challenging form forms need to be split. It is going to introduce a method that easily verifies each split form using `group`.

Sometimes, the built-in verification alone is not enough, so it is necessary to create your own verifier through customization. We present how to create a custom validator.

### Parsley Installation

As mentioned earlier, parsley can be initialized using data properties and initialized using JavaScript.

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="parsley.min.js"></script>

<form data-parsley-validate>
...
</form>

```

- Insert jQuery 1.8 or higher.
- Insert parsley.js or parsley.min.js after jQuery.
- Finally, `data-parsley-validate` is added to the form to be verified.

Parsley adds many classes and elements to the DOM when validating. You can modify the style to suit yourself, but there is also a basic Parsley css file that is used as an example of a project using bootstrap and parsley together.

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="parsley.min.js"></script>

<form id="form">
...
</form>

<script type="text/javascript">
$('#form').parsley();
</script>

```

Install like installation method using data properties, but do not add data properties to <form> and `$(`#form`).Initialize using jQuery as parsley(options);` or passively join form to parsley as new parsley(`#form`, options);`.

> In translation, the term bind often appeared, but the word bind was not found, so I just used the word bond.

> Do not add data-parsley-validate to your forms Please be aware that Parsley looks at all data-parsley-validate occurrences in DOM on document load and automatically binds them if valid. Once a form or field instance is bound by Pars that if this DOM validation attribute is present, doing $('#form').parsley(options); would just return the automatically bound instance, and not the one you would expect with the options you wanted to set.

When initializing with JavaScript, I don't think you should add 'data-parsley-validate'... I leave the original text due to lack of understanding.

Parsley provides a variety of error messages for embedded inspectors. It is provided in English by default, but it also provides various language scripts for other languages. Various language files can be found in i18n, of which `ko.js` is a Korean language file. You can copy it and save it as a js file and add it after `parsley.js`. Of course, when you download the full version of parsley, it is included in the src/i18n folder.

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="parsley.min.js"></script>
<script src="ko.js"></script>

```

Parsley strives for highly isolated modularity. It uses events and inheritance and allows various plug-ins.

Plug-ins currently available:

- Parsley Remote : provides ajax verification and asynchronous verification.
- Parsley Extras: provides some useful verification and redundancy.

### Parsley Configuration

Parsley provides a number of documents, and default.js allows us to look at the basic configuration.

```js
define('parsley/defaults', function () {
var ParsleyDefaults = {

```

All of the following options can be overridden and set using `data-parsley-` directly in the DOM.

For example, `inputs` can be set using `data-parsley-inputs= `input, textarea`. `data-parsley-stop-on-first-failing-constraint="false"`도 한가지 예이다.

```js
namespace: 'data-parsley-',
inputs: 'input, textarea, select',
excluded: 'input[type=button], input[type=submit], input[type=reset], input[type=hidden]',
priorityEnabled: true,

```

- It uses `data-parsley-` as its namespace.
- Basically, input elements that support form verification are input, textarea, select.
- By default, the input elements excluded from form validation are input[type="button", input[type="submit"), input[type="reset"], and input[type="hidden".
- Enable stopping validation of fields if verification of high priority fails by default

```js
multiple: null,
group: null,

```

- Use groups as identifiers for inputs such as radio or checkboxes.
- Identifiers (or array of identifiers) are used only to verify the selection of the inputs group.

```js
uiEnabled: true,
validationThreshold: 3,
focus: 'first',
trigger: false,
errorClass: 'parsley-error',
successClass: 'parsley-success',
classHandler: function (ParsleyField) {},
errorsContainer: function (ParsleyField) {},
errorsWrapper: '<ul class="parsley-errors-list"></ul>',
errorTemplate: '<li></li>'
};

return ParsleyDefaults;
});

```

- The default is to enable error messages.
- Time to wait before validation (this is where validation begins after default 3-letter typing)
- It can have values of `first`, `last`, and `none` as fields that will be focused when errors occur in form verification.
- It generates verification with `$.Event()`. For example, `keyup`, `change`, etc.
- The class name to be added when an error occurs in the field.
- The class name to be added when validation is successful in the field.
- It returns `$element` to specify which elements will receive the above classes.
- It returns `$element` by designating containers that contain error messages.
- ul element that will receive the error list
- The li element that will receive the error message
