LESS Language Features

In this article, we will take some time to study while looking at the overall forest about LESS.

If this part is preceded first, LESS Syntax will be easier.

### LESS OVERVIEW

Let`s learn about the overall LESS now.

Variables

The LESS variable is easy to understand by looking at the following code:

Variable names use `@`.

```css
@nice-blue: #5B83AD;
@light-blue: @nice-blue + #111;

#header {
color: @light-blue;
}
```

```css
#header {
color: #6c94be;
}
```

Attention!!! In LESS, variables are practically `constants`.

So you can define it only once.

Mixins (Mix-in)

Mix-in is a method of defining and including a group of attributes within a rule set.

Suppose you have the following classes:

```css
.bordered {
border-top: dotted 1px black;
border-bottom: solid 2px black;
}
```

Create properties within the class rule set as shown above.

Then, you can write it in the selector position to use the above set as shown below.

```css
#menu a {
color: #111;
.bordered;
}

.post a {
color: red;
.bordered;
}
```

Nested Rules

LESS grants the ability to use nested or combined instead of creating CSS cascading.

Suppose you have the following common CSSs:

```css
#header {
color: black;
}
#header .navigation {
font-size: 12px;
}
#header .logo {
width: 300px;
}
```

In LESS, you can create the methods created above in the following ways:

```css
h1 {
.mixin2(2px 3px 3 3 33 3;)
}
#header {
color: black;
.navigation {
font-size: 12px;
}
.logo {
width: 300px;
}
}
```

When written as above, it is compiled into CSS as follows:

```css
#header {
color: black;
}
#header .navigation {
font-size: 12px;
}
#header .logo {
width: 300px;
}
```

The LESS writing method is more concise and mimics HTML-like structures.

Users can also use a mixed-in method to group virtual selectors.

Let`s write a classic clearfix in a mixed-in method below.

```css
.clearfix {
display: block;
zoom: 1;
```

```css
.clearfix {
display: block;
zoom: 1;
}
.clearfix:after {
content: " ";
display: block;
font-size: 0;
height: 0;
clear: both;
visibility: hidden;
}

```

Nested Directives and Bubbling (overlapping with overlapping indicators)

Instructions such as `media` and `keyframe` can be nested like selectors.

The indicator is placed at the top and the relative order of the other elements remains unchanged.

The conditional instructions such as `@media`, `@support` and `@document` are copied to their body. As follows:

```css
.screen-color {
@media screen {
color: green;
@media (min-width: 768px) {
color: red;
}
}
@media tv {
color: black;
}
}
```

```css
@media screen {
.screen-color {
color: green;
}
}
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
.screen-color {
color: red;
}
}
@media tv {
.screen-color {
color: black;
}
}
```

For example, non-conditional instructions for `font-face` or `keyframes` are also bubbled.

```css
#a {
color: blue;
@font-face {
src: made-up-url;
}
padding: 2 2 2 2;
}
```

```css
#a {
color: blue;
}
@font-face {
src: made-up-url;
}
#a {
padding: 2 2 2 2;
}
```

Operations (operators)

The arithmetic operators `+, -, *, /` can manipulate numbers, colors, or variables.

Units of things that are impossible or meaningless will be ignored.

```css
The numbers are converted into equal units.
@conversion-1: 5cm + 10mm; // 6cm
@conversion-2: 2 - 3cm - 5mm; // 1.5cm

// Transformation is not possible (in practice, compilation and use will result in figures but an unexpected number).
@incompatible-units: 2 + 5px - 3cm; // ???

// Example written as variable
@base: 5%;
@filler: @base * 2; // 10%
@other: @base + @filler; // 15%
```

When LESS computes a unit, it recognizes the unit and reflects it in the results.

```css
'@var: return 1px + 5; // 6px
@width: (@var + 5) * 2;

.operation {
width: @width;
border: (@width * 2) solid black;
}
```

```css
.operation {
width: 22px;
border: 44px solid black;
}
```

Escaping

Escape can use any string as the value of the attribute or variable.

It can be used with the exception of interpolation inside ~"anything" or ~"anything" (the interpolation method is later...)

Occasionally, you might need to output CSS values using invalid CSS grammar or using unique grammar that LESS does not recognize.

If the grammar is not recognized by LESS, it is escaped because an error occurs and it is not compiled.

To represent those values, put the ~ symbol before you.

Take a look at the following examples:

```css
.ms-filter {
filter: ~"ms:alwaysHasItsOwnSyntax.For.Stuff()";
}
```

```css
.ms-filter {
filter: ms:alwaysHasItsOwnSyntax.For.Stuff();
}
```

Functions

LESS provides a variety of functions to transform colors, manipulate strings, and perform mathematics.

These functions are documented in the function reference.

Using a function is quite simple.

The following example converts 0.5 to 50%, increases the saturation of the 5% base color, brightens 25% and rotates 8 degrees to set the background color.

```css
.functions {
width: percentage(@width); // `50%` 반환
color: saturate(@base, 5%);
background-color: spin(lighten(@base, 25%), 8);
}
```

```css
.functions {
width: 50%;
color: #f6430f;
background-color: #f8b38d;
}
```

Namespaces and Accessors

Please do not confuse the choice of CSS @namespace or Namespace.

Sometimes you may want to group variables or mix-ins for the purpose of a team, or to provide some encapsulated sources.

In LESS, you can group variables or mix-ins in a very intuitive way.

- Put some mix-ins and variables in the #bundle that you would like to group for later reuse or distribution.

To mix the .button class (mix-in) in #headera, do the following::

```css
#bundle {
.button () {
display: block;
border: 1px solid black;
background-color: grey;
```

```css
#bundle .tab {
padding: 10px;
}
#bundle .citation {
line-height: 1;
}
#header a {
color: orange;
/* Mix-in call*/
display: block;
border: 1px solid black;
background-color: grey;
}
#header a:hover {
background-color: white;
}
```

Scope

The scope of LESS is very similar to the normal programming language.

Variables and mix-ins are first found on the local scope, and if variables or mix-ins are not found, the compiler will find them in the parent scope.

```css
// Global Scope
@var: red;

#page {
// Region scope
@var: white;
#header {
color: @var; // white (find first on the local scope)
}
}
```

```css
#page #header {
color: white;
}
```

If there are no variables within the local scope, search the global scope. As follows:

```css
@var: red;

#page {
#header {
color: @var; // red (search and find the global scope because it is not on the local scope)
}
}
```

```css
#page #header {
color: red;
}
```

Comments

The comments in LESS are the same as JavaScript comments.

Instead, /* ... used by CSS */ Annotations are compiled and kept in CSS, but // annotations are not output to CSS.

```css
'/* CSS-style annotations and are retained in CSS. */
// One-line annotation not visible in CSS.
.comments { color: red }
```

```css
'/* CSS-style annotations and are retained in CSS. */
.comments {
color: red;
}

```

Importing (files)

In the main .less file, another.You can call in less files, all the variables, mix-ins, and use them.The less extension is optional, so you can use both forms below.:

```css
@import "lib.less";
@import "lib";
```

If LESS wants to import the CSS file itself without processing it, just use the .css extension.

```css
@import "lib.css";
```

When you call it this way, the CSS file is recalled and shown without any conversion.
