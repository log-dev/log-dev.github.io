Region Variables VS Global Variables

The scope is the lifetime of the variable.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

```js
var scope = 'global';
function fnScope() {
console.log(scope);
}
fnScope();
```

The point is that the purpose of the code above is to have access to a variable called scope that is not declared in the function but outside the function.

When you declare a variable outside of a function, it becomes a global variable, which is accessible across the application.

In other words, the variable can be accessed within any function. This is why global, the value of the scope declared outside the function, was returned when the scope was clicked within the fnScope.

```js
var scope = 'global';
function fnScope() {
var scope = 'local';
console.log('in function'+scope);
}
fnScope();
console.log('Out of Function' + scope);'
```

The above code used local, a local declared within the function when looking up the scope in the function.

However, when the scope was called outside the function, the global variable global was used.

The effective range of region variables is within a function, and the effective range of global variables is application-wide, and if both region variables with the same name and global variables are defined at the same time, you can see that region variables take precedence.

If you look at the example below, all the results are all local.

```js
var scope = 'global';
function fnScope() {
scope = 'local';
console.log('in function'+scope);
}
fnScope();

console.log('Out of Function' + scope);'
```

Why is the value of scope local outside of the function?
