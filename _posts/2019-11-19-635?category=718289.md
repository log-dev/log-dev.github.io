# What is Webpack?

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/9954D7465D475F131A)

`Webpack` official site introduction image

As you can see on the Webpack page, the Webpack is a Module Bundler.
So what is a "bundler"?
We define the bundler as a package that includes everything you need to sell to work with the software and some hardware. This is a programmatically approaching tool that accurately tracks the required dependencies and groups them.

In other words, Webpack introduces js, css, img, webfont, etc., which are related web resources (configuration files of web applications) to operate web pages, as shown in official site images. When Webpack recognizes and bundles configuration files such as , it finally compresses and shrinks existing original files and converts them into optimized stacked resources (files), which is called bundling.

## Why and what are the advantages of using Webpack?

Webpack Reason for Use

The latest front-end framework has emerged as single-page application (SPA) development has gained popularity throughout the era of server-side templates, resulting in exponential code growth in JavaScript.

The amount of code in this development approach can be thousands or tens of thousands of lines, and finding and modifying a particular code in JavaScript code can be a challenge. Therefore, JavaScript code was separated by modules in the early stages of development to suit API function and UI components.
However, if you load multiple or many separate JavaScript files one by one, there is a lot of room for major slow-down problems when loading web pages.
This is why module bundlers such as web packs have made it necessary to bundle a large number of JavaScript files into a single JS file, increasing the performance of the project, improving the structure, and increasing the importance of the development life cycle.

As I have already mentioned, the web page is made up of many components, and in addition to basic html, js, and css files, webfont, image, json data, etc. must be requested and received. Many of these files are inefficient because one request must be completed before the next request can be sent. Thus, to reduce the number of requests, images can be sprinted and loaded only once, and development productivity was increased with Gulp, Grunt, task runner build tools until the webpack appeared to combine js, css files into one.

To increase development productivity, there was a Web Task Manager (Gulp, Grunt), and these tools helped reduce the development lifecycle, and subsequently added aspects of module dependency management. In fact, in the past, JavaScript (based on ES5) did not support modularity on its own, so there were libraries or tools for modularity, and additional libraries or their functions could be installed and used in Gulp and Grunt, but webpack provides a big difference in minification.

In other words, the Webpack is an integrated web development tool that can even manage the capabilities + module dependencies of the existing WebTack Manager (Gulp, Grunt).

And as we develop front-end today, React, Angular, and Vue, which are the latest front-end frameworks we encounter, recommend using `Webpack`, so we can naturally encounter web packs.
For example, if you are developing an SPA, you can use Vue as a viewer that can increase the development productivity of Vue, which uses webpack`s `loader` and generally requires knowledge of webpack to use the vue framework.
React and Angular are the same, so web packs are a must, not a choice, in these days.

Webpack Advantage

Some of the tools that perform similar tasks, such as `Webpack`, include Browserify, Grunt, Gulp, etc.

So why is Webpack better than the above tools and what is the difference?

Previously, tools such as Grunt and Gulp could reduce the development life cycle to increase web development productivity, but furthermore, web packs manage module dependencies.

The existing task runner Grunt, Gulp is used exclusively as a tool for resources and has no concept of `dependency graph`. `Webpack` is a Package Bundler (reproduction of dependent application modules as static sources) and Gulp, Grunt is a Task Runner (automation of specific repeatable tasks).
In other words, Task Runner is just performing some predefined task, and Package Bundler is literally package some sources. Grunt, Gulp is a tool that can be bundled when a set of tasks is defined and executed, but `webpack` is originally intended for bundling, including managing dependencies.
In other words, as the pencil continues to be sharpened, it is Gulp or Grunt that can sting quite a bit, and Webpack has been named toothpick since the beginning.
For more information, see Webpack VS Gulp, Grunt or Gulp vs Webpack differences.

### JavaScript Modularization Issues

```undefined
<script src="/js/vendor/vendor01.js"></script>
<script src="/js/module01.js"></script>
<script src="/js/lib/library01.js"></script>
<script src="/js/module02.js"></script>
<script src="/js/module03.js"></script>
```

The above code is an example of JavaScript modularity with the generic "script" tag, which can cause management problems due to conflicts of global variables and issues and complexities based on library loading order, even if multiple files are loaded.

To address this, AMD and other module loaders, Webpack, will appear.

Module

As you can see above, a module is a small unit of code that has a specific function from a programming perspective.

If you type in JavaScript, the following code is a module.

```js
// math.js
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}

function substract(a, b) {
return a - b;
}

const pi = 3.14;

export { sum, substract, pi }
```

This math.js file is a module that has three functions as shown below.

- sum() function, which takes the sum of two numbers
- Substract() function to obtain a difference of two numbers
- Pi constant with a circumference value

If you manage functions with similar personalities as one meaningful file, it becomes a module.

Modules in Web Pack

The concept of a module, referred to in the Webpack, refers to all the resources that comprise a web application, not just the JavaScript module as above. Web applications require a lot of files such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Images, Font, etc. Each of these files is a module.
Module bundling is the behavior of merging and compressing hundreds and hundreds of resources that make up a web application into a single file, as shown on the Webpack`s official website.

Background of Webpack appearance

There are three main reasons why web packs appeared.

- #1. Need to manage JavaScript modules per file
- #2. Web Task Manager Automation Tool
- #3. Fast loading and high performance of web applications

#1. Manage JavaScript Modules in File Units

JavaScript designed from a particle perspective has a convenient effective range as shown below.

```js
var a = 10;
console.log(a); // 10

function logText() {
console.log(a); // 10
}
```

By default, the variable effective range in JavaScript has a global range. It has the widest range of variables, so it`s easy to access from anywhere.

However, these advantages actually turn into problems when developing web applications:

```undefined
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
<head>
<!-- ... -->
</head>
<body>
<!-- ... -->
<script src="./app.js"></script>
<script src="./main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

```js
// app.js
var num = 10;
function getNum() {
console.log(num);
}
```

```js
// main.js
var num = 20;
function getNum() {
console.log(num);
}
```

Let`s say that you load and use the two JavaScript files in index.html as above.

What would be the result if I execute the code in the script like below?

```undefined
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
<head>
<!-- ... -->
</head>
<body>
<!-- ... -->
<script src="./app.js"></script>
<script src="./main.js"></script>
<script>
getNum(); // 20
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

The result is 20. The num variable declared in app.js is because main.js declared again and assigned 20.

These challenges arise when developing complex applications.
You can duplicate a variable or assign an unintended value unless you remember all the names of the variables.
This desire to manage variables on a per-file basis, and to modularize JavaScript, has previously been addressed by libraries such as AMD and Common.js.

#2. Web Development Task Automation Tool

Previously, the most common task in front-end development was to modify and save the code in a text editor and click Refresh in the browser. That way, I could see the changes on the screen.

In addition, when developing and distributing web services to web servers, I had to do the following tasks.

- HTML, CSS, JS compression
- Image Compression
- CSS Preprocessor Conversion

Tools such as Grunt and Gulp emerged as the need for tools to automate these tasks.

#3. Fast loading and high performance of web applications

Statistically, if a website does not appear within five seconds of accessing a particular website, most users leave it.
Therefore, there was a lot of effort to increase the loading speed of the website.
A representative effort is to reduce the number of files requested by the browser to the server.
To do this, we used the Web Task Manager we discussed earlier to compress and merge files.

In addition, the resources needed later to speed up the initial page loading were called Lazy Loading.

The webpack basically has a philosophy of not loading the necessary resources in advance, but requesting them at that time.

Problems that you want to troubleshoot with a Webpack

As we`ve seen in the background of the webpack appearance, there are four existing problems that we`re trying to solve in the webpack:

- JavaScript Variable Valid Range
- Limit the number of HTTP requests per browser
- Management of unused code
- Dynamic Loading

# JavaScript Variable Validity Range Problem

Webpack solves problems with the variable effective range with ES6`s Modules syntax and Webpack`s module bundling.

# Restrictions on the number of HTTP requests per browser

The TCP specification limits the number of HTTP requests a browser can send to the server at a time.
Therefore, reducing the number of HTTP requests can not only improve the performance of Web applications, but also speed up the time users operate the site.

For this performance optimization, you can avoid the above browser-specific HTTP request number constraints if you combine multiple files into a single webpack.

# Dynamic Loading

Without a library such as Require.js, it was impossible to dynamically load modules at the desired moment.
However, now you can load any module at any time using the Code Splitting feature of the webpack.

Webpack philosophy

- Everything is a module.
All web resources (js, css, html, img, webfont...) can be loaded in modular form.
It is difficult to view css and html as modules because they are not usually loaded into JavaScript ( <script src="index.html"></script>).
However, Webpack supports loading (via Loader) css, html, images, etc. into JavaScript.
- Do not load all unnecessary things initially (e.g., Lazy loading) but only load and use what is needed when needed.

## Background knowledge for setting up a Webpack development environment

To use a web pack, you need the knowledge of the players needed to set up the development environment.

Node.js, Node Package Manager (NPM) and CLI (Command Line) for development environment setup
After learning `Interface`) and so on, we will learn about setting up a full-fledged webpack.

### Node.js

Several build systems, including Webpack, are based on the stream functionality of `Node.js`, so `Node.js` and `NPM` must be installed on the computer. First, install node.js that is appropriate for your operating system.

Many other files, including Webpack, require Node.js to be installed (including NPM) to download, install, and configure packages (packages) of necessary configuration files.

You can then use the npm command in Node.js to download or execute the package.

The nodejs site allows you to browse the operating system to download the node.js installer, so you won`t need to select the OS-specific launcher. The installation process is not covered here.

When Node.js is finished installing, ensure that Node.js is installed in the CLI with the `node --version` command as follows:

```bash
$ node -v
v8.11.3

```

--version can be abbreviated to -v, and if the version is printed as shown above, node.js is installed correctly.

The $ symbol is a symbol that is meant to be used in the command line interface and does not type the $ symbol.

If you can`t run the command on your Mac, you have to put sudo at the beginning with `sudonode -v`.
sudo means super do.

Basic CLI commands that are good to know

For Windows operating systems, `git bash` is recommended because there are commands that do not run in the cmd window.

```bash
$ cd Desktop
# Enter the change directory (cd) command to move from the current location to another directory and enter the directory name

$ cd ..
# To go directly from the current directory to the parent directory, enter a double point (...) after the cd command.

$ cd ../..
# To move from parent to parent directory, enter double points separated by a slash (/)

$ c:\
Go to drive # c

$ d:\
Go to # d drive

$ mkdir study
Used to create a new directory with the abbreviation # make directory

$ mkdir css js images include
# Listing directory names separated by spaces allows multiple folders to be created at once

$ ls
Use the # ls (abbreviation of List) command to view the list of files in the directory at your current location.
# File names or folder names are output listed horizontally

$ ls -l
The # ls command is followed by the option flag dash (-) and lowercase l.
# Outputs detailed information such as file permissions, owners, groups, size, date, time, etc.

$ ls -a
# Flag - a even shows hidden files

$ ls -al
Use the # -a, -l option flags to output information.

$ ls css/
$ ls js/
# To view the list of subdirectory files in the current directory, enter the subdirectory name after the ls command.

$ pwd
# The pwd (print working directory) command outputs the absolute path to the directory you are currently working on.

$ clear
# As intended, the output of the results according to the commands and instructions that have been executed will be deleted cleanly.
# In Window cmd, cls

$ exit
Enter # exit to exit the CLI tool

```

### NPM(Node Package Manager)

Node Package Manager (NPM) is a package manager that lets you install and manage JavaScript libraries with commands.
It`s also listed on the NPM`s official site, but JavaScript developers around the world put their JavaScript libraries in public repositories.
The `npm` command makes it easy to download.

NPM Commands

Let`s find out which npm commands are used frequently.

First, as we checked the `node -v` version, we will check the npm version.

```bash
$ npm -v
5.6.0

```

# Create package.json

Typically, before configuring Webpack, you must set up `package.json` to manage the node modules of your project.

I`m going to write it as below.

```bash
$ npm init
```

The NPM command, npm init, creates a `package.json` file in the form of an initial command that prompts the user for answers.

package.json is a required file for distribution (publish).

You can also create the package.json file yourself, but it is common and convenient to create it with the initialization command when you first use it.

Starting with the name, the user is asked for various information, such as version and description, except when entering a value, press Enter to exceed the value. At the end, the question Is this ok? (yes) appears, and pressing Enter will create a `package.json` file.

When you open the package.json file, the document contains the answers to the questions, and you can delete and organize any unnecessary parts of the document.

The author has created a package.json file as shown below.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/9959C63F5DD3464D01)

If you want to omit the above set of procedures and create a package.json because you only need the same default information as above.
You can use the flag `--yes` or the abbreviation `-y`.

If you created a package.json that contains only the basic information, please delete it and run it again as below.

```bash
$ npm init -y
```

This makes it easier to initialize package.json, which contains only basic information, just like existing package.json files.

# Package Installation and Update

You can install node modules and update package.json for your project at `npm`.

For example, the `npm install package name --save-dev` would be used to download the package from the `npm` store.

Let`s download the popular library `jquery` until now (?).

```bash
$ npm install jquery --save
```

As a result of running `npm`, you can see that `jquery` has been added to the package.json`s dependencies, a folder named node_modules has been created, and a file related to `jquery` is loaded in that subfolder.

You can also use i as an abbreviation instead of the command `install`.

```bash
'$ npm i Package Name'
```

Downloading `jquery` as above is a regional installation.

You need to learn about global and local installations here.

Global Installation Vs Local Installation

Installing the jquery module above will result in a local installation of the local folder node_modules subdirectory in the current project, but installing it globally will result in a global installation of packages within the system level of each operating system.

# NPM Global Installation

The NPM global installation is used to install JavaScript libraries to be used at the system level, rather than to recall libraries to be used in projects as shown above.

```bash
$ npm i webpack --global
```

After the library is installed, it will now recognize the command when you enter the library name in the command execution window.

By executing the above command, you can perform the `webpack` command in any directory.

Go to a different directory and run the following commands within that directory to see the `webpack` version:

In other words, a global installation may occasionally require packages to be installed to run anywhere, not just in the current directory.

```bash
$ webpack --version
```

This means that if you want to proceed with a generic (?) command from the CLI, you can install it as `-global (-g).

You can also locally install and use `webpack` to import from the webpack.config.js file into require().

```js
const webpack = require('webpack');
```

NodeJS allows external modules to be imported via the `require` method.

npm install --save VS --save-dev

`--save` is used to install the modules and libraries required to run the application.

In other words, if you use j-query, you should use the `--save` flag when you install it because it is a library that is needed to run the app in real-world services.

```json
// package.json
"dependencies": {
"jquery": "^3.4.1"
}
```

If you installed jquery earlier, you can see that the jquery library has been added to package.json as dependencies as shown above.

The `--save-dev` is used when installing modules and libraries that are required only for application development.

For example, live reloading, build tools, etc., are used to assist development with utility tools needed for ease of development, productivity, rather than libraries needed for apps to run in real-world services.

Let`s try installing gulp below.

```bash
$ npm i gulp --save-dev
```

```json
// package.json
"dependencies": {
"jquery": "^3.4.1"
},
"devDependencies": {
"gulp": "^4.0.2"
}
```

If you check the package.json, you can see that gulp has been added to devDependencies.

The addition of the `--save-dev` flag will only install the defendencies as devDependencies, because Gulp and related defendencies will only need to be in the application development process.

You should give the same `--save-dev` option to install the Gulf`s plug-ins later.

```bash
$ npm i gulp -D
```

### Conclusion

So far, we have conducted basic prior learning to understand and use Webpack.

In the next chapter, you will learn about Webpack as you step-by-step install the modules and libraries needed to configure and develop your Webpack environment.
