Specifying the scope of the table

Blind people cannot see the browser with their eyes, so they should listen only to the information about the table through a program called Screen Reader.

For this reason, you can specify a scope for each cell of the table to create an order in which programs read data to go down.

This can bring great benefits to web standards and accessibility.

For the above table illustration, the order in which the screen reader reads is "Area195 → Sold price 87,500 → Rental price 38,500£.

Area, sale price, and charter price are the lines corresponding to the ad, and the area can be designated as follows as scolpe="col".

```undefined
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">면적(㎡)</th>
£th scope="col">Trade price (KRW 10,000)</th>
£th scope="col"></th>
</tr>
</thead>
```

159B and 195 are lines corresponding to tbody, and the area can be specified as scolpe="row" as follows:

```undefined
<tbody>
<tr>
<td scope="row">159B</td>
<td>75,500</td>
<td>33,500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td scope="row">195</td>
<td>87,500</td>
<td>38,500</td>
</tr>
```

For the table illustration below, `product type` should use `scope="colgroup" because the rows are merged.

```undefined
<thead>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2" scope="col">구분</th>
<th colspan="2" scope="colgroup">상품종류</th>
</tr>
<tr>
.......
.......
```

The order in which screen readers read will be "Differentiation → January → 50,000 smartphones → 30,000 tablet PCs."
