Physician (virtual) classes are often used in the form of :hover and :before, :active.

And today, CSS3 offers a significant number of new pseudo-virtual classes to give you more control over the web.

This article will focus on nth-child and introduce some other virtual classes.

### Select First and Last Elements

Let me briefly point to the commonly used selectors.

- :first-child selects the first child of an element, regardless of its type. This virtual class was first defined in CSS2.1 and is supported by IE7+ all browsers.
- :first-of-type finds the first in a particular type of element in a container. For example, p:first-of-type will choose the first p element regardless of whether it is the parent`s first child or not.
- :last-child selects the last child of an element, regardless of its type.
- The :last-of-type is exactly the same as the :first-of-type, but finds the end in elements of a particular type of container (type).
- :only-child chooses the element if there is only one child in the container. For example, in a markup for basic navigation, each `a` element is likely to be the only child of the `li` element in general.
- :only-of-type is the same as :ony-child. Select the element if it is the only one of its type (type) in the container. For example, if a div contains one h1 and one p, then each of these types (types) is the only factor.

:nth-child - nth child selector

The :nth-child virtual class is more flexible than the first or last selectors to help you choose.

I mean, the fifth or the eighth... Or if you want to choose your 54th child and you use :nth-child(), it`s very easy to choose.

The most basic way to use :nth-child() is to clearly state which child you want to choose, as shown in the following example:

```undefined
<ul>
<li>List Item One</li>
<li>List Item Two</li>
<li>List Item Three</li>
<li>List Item Four</li>
</ul>

```

```css
ul li:nth-child(3) {
color: red;
}
```

In the example above, the letter color of the third list item will be red.

But what if you have an unpredictable number of list items, and you have to choose the last to fifth item?

Fortunately, you can do this if you use another doctor class.

The :nth-last-child() selector acts like :nth-child(), but counts from the end, not from the beginning. So li:nth-last-child (5) will choose the list item from the last to the fifth.

In addition, you can replace the -child portion of these selectors with -of-type as shown in the previous example when you need to be more specific.

For example, let`s look at the following code:

```undefined
<article>
<h1>Heading Top</h1>
<p>first paragraph.</p>
<p>second paragraph.</p>
<p>third paragraph.</p>
<p>fourth paragraph.</p>
</article>
```

```css
article p:nth-of-type(3) {
color: blue;
}
```

The above selector will change the letter color of the third paragraph.

On the other hand, if you use the `p:nth-child (3)` selector, you will choose the third child of the container regardless of type.

That is, you choose the second paragraph (second paraphrases).

### Expand Nth Child with Expression

The nth child pseudo-virtual class can take advantage of expressions for the number of times you need to choose a much more complex pattern as well as a simple number.

These expressions take the form of an + b;.

That is, for example, 2n+1 is to choose an odd number of children.

Then how will this expression work?

The expression above is a simple mathematical equation, and n starts from zero and increases by one.

If you take a closer look at this expression, you can see that it is a way to choose an odd number of children each time. However, if you use a different method, you will be able to understand it at a glance.

Let`s take the next 5n + 3 as an example.

where the first number [5] indicates that each child must be selected as the target. The second number [3] indicates the starting point of the array.

So here, starting with the third child, the fifth child will be chosen every time.

For this example, children of the third, eighth, thirteenth, thirteenth (etc.) will be chosen.

### Leverage nth child and keywords

The nth child pseudo-virtual class can also select one of two short keywords, as well as integers and expressions.

These two keywords are odd and even.

```css
p:nth-child(odd) { color: red; }
p:nth-child(even) { color: blue; }
```

The odd keyword is a 2n+1 abbreviation, as we saw in the previous example, and the even keyword can be used as 2n+2 or 2n+0 (or just 2n).

In the case of even keywords, even those who are not familiar with expressions can know immediately.

### Use negative numbers with nth child

The nth child pseudo-class can use negative as well as positive numbers that have been used so far.

You may have doubts about when to use negative numbers, but you can actually use them in several effective ways.

```undefined
<ul>
<li>1. Lorem ipsum</li>
<li>2. dolor sit amet</li>
<li>3. consectetur adipisicing elit.</li>
<li>4. Dolor dolorem dolores</li>
<li>5. excepturi iure laborum</li>
<li>6. placeat quis</li>
<li>7. quod soluta</li>
<li>8. sunt voluptatum.</li>
<li>9. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</li>
<li>10. consectetur adipisicing.</li>
</ul>
```

What should we do if we have 10 list items like the above code and we need to apply the appropriate style to items 1st and 2nd, 3rd and 6th and 9th and 10th?

You can use :nth-child() to define each region as follows:

```css
li:first-child,
li:nth-child(2) {
background: green;
}

li:nth-child(3),
li:nth-child(4),
li:nth-child(5),
li:nth-child(6) {
background: blue;
}

li:last-child,
li:nth-last-child(2) {
background: red;
}
```

This code will function properly, but there is a problem that there are too many selectors using a total of eight.

This allows you to reduce the total number of selectors to three, one for each set in each rule.

To select the top two regions, the user can use the expression -1n+2.

What you remember here is that the selection process starts with the second index. Here, the second child and the first number (-1) is that each child is selected (starting with the second child), but the direction is reversed with a negative number. So you choose the second item and the first item.

Let`s take a look at how this formula works in the following example:

Furthermore, more specific methods should be used to select the second option.

The first six can be selected as -n+6 using the method described earlier, and n+3 can be used using consecutive virtual classes to be more specific.

That is, the combination of -n+6 and n+3 can indicate that the selection process begins with the third item and ends with the sixth item.

```css
li:nth-child(-n+2) {
color: green;
}

li:nth-child(-n+6):nth-child(n+3) {
color: blue;
}

li:nth-last-child(-n+2) {
color: red;
}
```

The above code is much simpler than the original method.

The last item is the same as the previous one and was replaced only by `nth-last-child`.

### The most utilized of the other selectors

Now that we`ve almost covered the topic for the nth child selector, we still have a few more very useful virtual (doctoral) classes left.

Most of them are not yet commonly used.

All of the following selectors are supported by IE9+ and major Modern browsers:

Although it is not a general use step yet, it will be possible with selectizr introduced above.

- :empty selects content or childless elements. If there is a space empty space in the element, the element is not an empty element and cannot be selected.
- :not(x) is called an infinitive class and can be used to select all elements except X. where X is another selector (e.g. .demo).
- :target selects the element that is the target of the fragment identifier in the document`s URI. For example, if #demo appears at the end of the URI in the address window, you can use :target to select an element in HTML with the id #demo.

All of the above choices are useful and convenient. Especially in the case of :target, you can get more than convenience.

For example, when you use the id attribute as an anchor, you will use many features that allow you to connect links to other areas on the same page. The id anchor is inserted at the end of the URI. You can use :target to add style.

In other words, if you use :target, you can change the CSS style of that element if you click on it.

The last few virtual classes that we`re going to talk about are all related to the `form`

- :disabled selects elements that are not focused or selected in any way, for example, text input using the disabled HTML5 attribute.
- :enabled selects elements that are ready to be selected in the default state. In other words, use :disabled to select things that cannot be selected.
- :checked is intended for the radio button or checkbox selected by the user.

:checked is the most potentially recognized choice when experimenting with CSS3 and is a useful choice that can be used to change CSS when clicking on form elements.

In addition, in case of :target, such as id and page jump, there are problems that become difficult to work with when trying to change the CSS in the click state:checked is free from these problems.
