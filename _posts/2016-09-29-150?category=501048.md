Single tone

A single-ton pattern is an object-generated pattern that ensures that only one instance exists across the entire system.

Thus, the object literal is also a single-toned pattern.

```js
var singletonObj = {
a : 'Value',
b : function () {
}
}
```

However, you cannot define private states and functions with object literals. Large libraries often have private members that are not accessible externally. If JavaScript requires a private member, you must first keep in mind a closure.

This means that you must use a closure to create a single-toned object with private members.

The following is an example of implementing a single-toned pattern with a single-toned pattern.

```js
var Singleton = (function () {

/**
* --------------------------------
* Single tone pattern implementation code
* --------------------------------
*/

// Private variable, method definition
var instantiaed;

function init() {

// Define Single-Tone Objects
return {
// Define public methods
publicMethod : function () {
return 'hello Singleton Pattern!!!';
},
// Define Public Properties
publicProp : 'single value'
}

}

// Object defining the public method getInstance().
// Non-public variables, methods accessible (closet) due to lexical properties
return {
getInstance : function () {
if (!instantiaed) {
instantiaed = init();
}
return instantiaed;
}
}

})();

// Create a single-toned object to call publicMethod
var first = Singleton.getInstance();
first.publicMethod();
console.log(first.publicMethod()); // hello Singleton Pattern!!!

var second = Singleton.getInstance();
second.publicMethod();
console.log(second.publicMethod()); // hello Singleton Pattern!!!

console.log(first === second); // true
```

In the example code above, the object defined as an object literal in the return statement of init(), which is a private function, is a single-toned object.

This object will only exist throughout the program. The return statement of the externally disclosed anonymous function returns an object containing getInstance, a public method that obtains a single-toned object. The getInstance method checks the value of an instantiaed variable defined as an internal variable and determines that a singleton object has not yet been created, then invokes the internal function init to create a singleton object and return it. You then assign a single-toned object to the instantiaed number.

In this general, a single-toned pattern requires an internal variable, such as instantiaed, that tells you if an object has already been created.

In addition, the single-toned pattern must use a closure that returns an object that can access the internal variable.

In the code above, the only object containing publicMethod(), publicProp is created using the attribute(Closure) that allows access to the private variable instantiaed in the getInstance function inside and the attribute(Closure) that remains after the getInstane() call.

So even if you call singleton.getInstance a few times, the resulting objects all point to the same single-toned object.
