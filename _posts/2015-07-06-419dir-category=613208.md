The preview feature is not supported by default when using the markdown plug-in in sub-lime text. Of course, it is possible if you install a plug-in with preview function separately. Here are the plug-ins that make this possible.

### OmniMarkupPreviewer 소개

The OmniMarkupPreviewer plugin previews markups via web browsers in sublimation text2 and sublimation text3. It communicates with a web browser in the background to render html markups in real time. In addition, html deliverables can be exported.

Markup languages supported by OmniMarkupPreviewer:

- Markdown
- reStructuredText
- WikiCreole
- Textile
- Pod (Requires Perl >= 5.10 and can be found in PATH, if the perl version < 5.10, Pod::Simple should be installed from CPAN.)
- RDoc (Requires ruby in your PATH)
- Org Mode (Requires ruby, and gem org-ruby should be installed)
- MediaWiki (Requires ruby, as well as gem wikicloth)
- AsciiDoc (Requires ruby, as well as gem asciidoctor)
- Literate Haskell

> I thought it was just a mark-down preview, but I was also supporting a lot of other documents.
