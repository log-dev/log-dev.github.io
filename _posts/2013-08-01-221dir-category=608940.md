Set based on PHP installed from Ubuntu to apt-get.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/222C9243554246F31A)

php.ini 위치 : /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

The default php.ini file contains the content of php.ini-production for real-world services, and the php.ini-development is also provided as a sample file.

Sample file location: /usr/share/php5/

### Modifying php.ini using .htaccess

If you are hosted or wish to reflect your settings only on a particular site, you can create and set up a .htaccess file at the root of that site.

```undefined
php_value upload_max_filesize 50M
php_value post_max_size 50M
php_flag register_globals off
php_flag magic_quotes_gpc on

```

### Upload Settings

```undefined
sudo vi /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

; File upload permission
file_uploads = On

; Maximum upload file size
upload_max_filesize = 10M

; Maximum data size to be handed over in a Post manner
post_max_size = 10M

; Maximum running time. The larger the file size, the longer the time should be. Zero is infinite.
max_execution_time = 30

; How long does the php engine upload data before moving to the script page?
max_input_time = 3600

; Limit memory usage
memory_limit = 128M

```

Restart Apache

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart

```

Upload files sent using the form are sent in a format called `multipart/form-data`. The upper limit can be set for the transmission volume, which is `post_max_size`, which is recommended to be greater than upload_max_filesize.

post_max_size > upload_max_filesize

It is important to note that "upload_max_file_size" is the sum of the sizes of all the files you upload. post_max_size is the sum of all other field lengths plus the min header form including upload_max_filesize and encoder. Because the values in these fields are typically small size, they often set the value of post_max_size to the value of upload_max_size. These values are applicable to less than 2048M (2Gb).

기본값 post_max_size = 8M / upload_max_filesize = 2M

When the php engine processes data that is passed to the POST, memory is used to maintain a portion of the data that is passed to it. It only affects when the option `--enable-memory-limit` is set when php is installed (enabled when php is installed in Ubuntu). Setting the memory_limit value too high can be very risky, which, if multiple uploads are processed simultaneously, uses all available memory and affects the server as well as other unrelated scripts. Setting this value to zero eliminates the memory limit.

기본값 memory_limit = 128M

max_execution_time is the maximum execution time of the script, and if this value is 0, it is unlimited, max_input_time is the amount of time the script can spend when it accepts input, and -1 is the part to prevent the server from falling into an infinite loop.

If multiple megabytes of data need to be transferred, max_input_time should be high. In addition, the script can invoke the set_time_limit() function to override the settings in the ini file of max_input_time. Setting from php to set_time_limit (0) allows control of both times, so it is recommended to insert this code into the upload page.

기본값 max_execution_time = 30 / max_input_time = 60

The Apache Web Server uses the directive LimitRequestBody to limit POST data, which should be noted as it takes precedence over other values. Some distribution installations also set this value to 512 kb.

If you use multiple websites, set the default value and need to set a large amount of upload settings, use .htaccess as below to apply only to necessary sites.

```undefined
php_value upload_max_filesize 2000M

```

Since POST data = request data such as upload file data + header, it is arithmetically correct to hold larger than upload_max_filesize.

```undefined
php_value post_max_size 2000M

```

Recommend setting set_time_limit (0) for php script, if that is not possible, use setting below

```undefined
php_value max_execution_time 0

```

```undefined
php_value memory_limit 0

```

Unable to execute php file in upload directory

```undefined
<Directory "/var/www/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/">
php_admin_value engine off
</Directory>

```

### Error output

Basically, the error output is off for actual service. Let`s turn it on for the development environment.

```undefined
display_errors = On

```

### Time Zone Settings

```undefined
date.timezone = Asia/Seoul

```

When date.timezone is annotated, the following error is always followed.

```undefined
Warning: Unknown: It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those methods and you are stillease set date.timezone to select your timezone.

```

Setting the date.timezone = Asia/Seoul above will resolve it.
