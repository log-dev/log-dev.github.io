You`ve seen the applications reflected on the server as soon as you work and save them locally. There`s something like this in the sublime text, so let`s learn about it.

### Introducing Sublime SFTP

Sublime SFTP is a plug-in that extends the use of FTP and SFTP using sublime text. It supports FTP, SFTP, and SSH keys as well as password methods. It is charged, but there is no limit to the use. Sometimes a message asking for a purchase recommendation appears.

When accessing using an SSH key, Windows users should not use the SSH key as it is, but convert it to a ppk file using PuTTYgen.

- Reduce the amount of work to be done on the serverâ€”you can edit and manipulate files and folders on the server side.

### Sublime SFTP Installation

- After executing the sublime text, command Palette is recalled with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P.
- Select Package Control: Install Package, which is automatically completed when `install` is entered, and press Enter.
- When SFTP is detected by typing `sftp`, select it and press Enter to install it.

### Setting Up and Using Sublime SFTP

- Select SFTP/FTP > Map to Remote, for example, on projects registered with Sidebar or on open folders.
- A file named `sftp-config.json` is called to the editor that is created in the root folder (see below for example of a writer using cafe24.com hosting).
``"type": "sftp", //Transmission type settings, ftp, ftps also support
"upload_on_save": true, //Automatically send to server when local modification
"host": "aaaaa.cafe24.com", // host domain address or IP
"user": "aaaaa", //user name
"Password": "******", // use password
"remote_path": "/home/hosting_users/aaaaa/www/",
//"ssh_key_file": "~/.ssh/id_rsa", (when using ssh key instead of password)
`
- When this file is saved, all files and folders in the root folder will have a new option in the contact menu of the sidebar.
