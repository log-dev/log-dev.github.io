Modernizr for browser feature check

Traditionally, the browser Sniffing technique (using JavaScript`s `navigator.userAgent` property) was used to maintain browser compatibility. However, with various devices appearing and HTML5 and CSS3 becoming web standards, the implementation of HTML5 and CSS3 varies from browser to browser sniffing makes it almost impossible to maintain compatibility between these browsers.

### Modernizr Intro

Modernizr is a small, open-source JavaScript library used by users to find out which of the features defined in the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications are supported in their current web browsers.

In other words, it is possible to classify elements and attributes more accurately than traditional methods by checking whether they are supported or not.

Modernizr Features

- You can test more than 40 new elements and attributes, and if you include Modernizr scripts in Web documents, your browser will now be able to use CSS3 (@font-face, border-radius, border-image, box-shadow, rgba(), as well as the features of HTML5 (audio, video, local storage, and input elements).
- The modernizer creates a JavaScript object named Modernizr to determine whether it is supported by the attribute `boolean(true, false).
- The modernizer uses class values to indicate what elements and attributes are supported and unsupported for the `html` element.
- You can use the script loader provided by Modernizer to provide a polyfill for older browsers. With JavaScript, you can decide whether to add functionality to the unsupported part or simply reduce (from an elegant functional philosophy perspective) the functionality of a web page. In particular, you can add html5Shiv to support the header, nav, main, section, aside, and footer of HTML5, which is not supported by older IE.

Modernizer was developed under the principle of incremental functional improvement (step-by-step enhancement philosophy), so it allows you to add layers step by step to improve the functionality, starting with no JavaScript on the website.

Modernizer recommends this step-by-step development approach.

### Browser Support (whether browser is supported)

- IE6+
- Firefox 3.5+
- Opera 9.6+
- Safari 2+
- Chrome
- Mobile, iOS`s mobile Safari, Android`s Webkit browser, Opera Mobile, Firefox Mobile and whilst we`re stiil doing more testing we believe we support Blackberry 6+.

### Modernizr Usage

You can download Add your detections and Development build versions by accessing the Modernizer homepage.

- Add your details : You can only select items that you want to check for support by using in the actual server stage. If the minfiy is checked (default) in the left options after the user checks what they want to detect, click the build button on the right to download the compressed version of Custom Modernizr.
- Development build: The development version allows you to download files with all items checked. It is mainly used for testing purposes.

Clicking on the item you want to detect provides a description of the item, Polyfills, More Details, and so on.

For example, when you try to detect Box Sizing, click this item, and you will see links to Polyfills and more information about it.

Let`s look at some of the options in the left sidebar.

html5shiv

It is a tool that enables the default style of HTML5 to be applied in IE6–9, Safari 4.x (including iPhone 3.x), Firefox 3.x browsers, and enables the use of section elements of HTML5 especially in legacy IE.

html5printshiv

You must select this option if you need to print.

Add CSS classes

It is checked by default and adds classes to the `html` element to let you know the CSS3 properties and other support features that are supported.

Insert Modernizr

Insert the downloaded script into the <head> element.

```undefined
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css" />
<script src="js/lib/modernizr-custom.js"></script>
</head> 
```

In terms of performance, it is recommended to be positioned after the style sheet.

- This is because html5 Shiv must run before the <body> element.
- If you add CSS classes using Modernizr, it is necessary to prevent FOUC.

If you do not want to support IE8 or lower, or do not care about FOUC, you can add them wherever you want.

Add no-js

Have the `html` element add `class="no-js"

```undefined
<html class="no-js">
```

If the user`s web browser is in a JavaScript-enabled environment when Modernizr is running, the `no-js` part is changed to `js`, and the `no-insert` is added before the class name for the property that is not supported by the Modernizr build described above.

You can see that the class name has been added as shown in the picture below.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/26590938568371FE14)

### detection with Modernizr

The properties of the Modernizer are all in lowercase characters and by default use the format as shown below.

```js
if(Modernizr.svg) {
//svg supported
console.log(Modernizr.svg); // true 출력
} else {
//svg not supported
}
```

List only a few items that the Modernizer detects.

Please refer to Documentation for other lists.

```js
if(!Modernizr.input.placeholder){
document.write('<script src="polyfill.placeholder.js" type="text/javascript"></script>');
$("input[placeholder]").placeholder();
}
```

The above code means that if your browser is not supported by the placeholder in the input, you will load the polyfill script and use that js.

### Conditional JS with Modernizr.mq

Controlling Img Elements Using Modernizer Media Queries

Modernizer objects have a media query property called mq.

This will help you learn about the techniques that allow you to control the size of the image in the RWD (reactive type).

Of course, some of the ways to control image content for different screen sizes are to be used, such as Response JS, but may not be necessary for everyone`s needs. Other techniques include window.matchMedia, but not yet fully supported on all browsers/platforms.

If you don`t use this technique for the above reasons, Modernizer can be the solution.

The following sources use `data` for the `img` element to prepare two images:

```undefined
<img class="img" src="http://placekitten.com/320/480" alt="" data-big="http://placekitten.com/1024/768" />
```

Based on mobile first, the smaller image is set to the default URL provided, and the larger image is set to the data properties.

If the screen size is larger than mobile using Modernizr.mq, the user can set the URL of the data as the default URL as shown below.

```js
$(".img").each(function() {
if (Modernizr.mq('only screen and (min-width: 1200px)')) {
$(this).attr("src", $(this).attr("data-big"));
}
});
```

Now this solution will be one of the ways that can be used effectively for RWD sites.

### Using Modernizr Width CSS (using class of html elements and alternating method)

CSS Property Name - Modernizr JS Object Property (CSS Class Name)

- @font-face - fontface
- background-size - backgroundsize
- border-image - borderimage
- border-radius - borderradius
- box-shadow - boxshadow

```css
/* Simulated box shadow using borders: */
.demo {
border-bottom: 1px solid #666;
border-right: 1px solid #777;
}

.boxshadow div.demo {
border: none;
-webkit-box-shadow: #666 1px 1px 1px;
-moz-box-shadow: #666 1px 1px 1px;
box-shadow: #666 1px 1px 1px;
}
```

- Flexible Box Model - flexbox
- Multiple backgrounds - multiplebgs
- opacity - opacity
- rgba() - rgba
- hsla() - hsla

In most cases, rgba and hsla classes are provided by the browser by default with fallback.

This may prevent the use of the class `.hsla,` and `.rgba`.

```css
.my_container { /* no .hsla use necessary! */
background-color: #ccc; /* light grey fallback */
background-color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, .5); /* white with alpha */
}
```

- text-shadow - textshadow

IE9 and below does not support text-shadow.

```css
.glow {
/* ghosted letters */
color: transparent;
text-shadow: 0 0 10px black;
}
.no-textshadow .glow {
color: black;
}
```

- CSS Columns - csscolumns
- Generated Cotent (:before/:after) - generatedcontent
- CSS Animation - cssanimations

Android 2.1-3 works, but only one attribute can be animated.

Android 4+ can use most of the properties of animation as expected.

- CSS Gradients - cssgradients
- CSS Reflections - cssreflections
- CSS 2D Transforms - csstransforms
- CSS 3D Transforms - csstransforms3d
- CSS Transitions - csstransitions

A good example of use is to build Modernizr on an animation engine, use Native CSS transition if the browser has CSS transition, and implement the animation as JavaScript if the browser cannot use CSS transition.

### Example of using Modernizr

> 원문 출처 : Taking Advantage of HTML5 and CSS3 with Modernizr

Download the latest version from the Modernizer homepage and insert it into the `head` section as follows:

Remember to add a `no-js` class to the `<html>` element.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="no-js">
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<title>My Sample Page</title>
<script src="modernizr.js"></script>
</head>
…
```

When the modenerizer is running, the no-js class is changed to `js` to indicate whether JavaScript is available in the user`s web browser.

It also adds the class name for all attributes detected by the browser, but for attributes that the browser does not support, it will insert a `no-` before the class name.

Therefore, the `<html>` element will be rendered in an environment where JavaScript is available for page loading as shown below.

```undefined
<html class="js canvas canvastext no-geolocation rgba hsla multiplebgs borderimage borderradius boxshadow opacity cssanimations csscolumns cssgradients cssreflections csstransforms csstransforms3d
```

Modernizer creates a JavaScript object called Modernizr to provide a list of properties with Boolean values for each property.

Therefore, the value of `Modernizr.svg` returns a true value if the user browser supports the svg element, and a false value if not.

This Modernizr object even provides details about attribute properties, for example, `Modernizr.video.h264` tells you whether a browser supports certain codecs.

In addition, `Modernizr.inputtypes.search` will inform you of the support for the type of search input element.

From now on, we will learn how to apply Modernizr step by step. (See Original Source)

First, create one sample page (#1 version) where you have configured the default markup. And to make it look good, let`s add a little bit of style to get the overall format, color and layout.

As a result, the changed web page will look like this (#2 version).

Page #2 uses a user-specific font for the `h1` element, sorts the list of attributes available in Modernizr into two columns, and aligns the contents of Modernizr with images to the right. And change the outline of the web page to make it look better.

If you use CSS to add new attributes (additional styles), the web page will look more complete. However, if a particular browser does not recognize these attributes, it will be rendered ignoring the style.

Of course, CSS` cascading techniques allow you to use attributes such as `border-radius` without Modernizr.

However, with Modernizr, more additional features are available.

In other words, if a browser supports these and other attributes, it can be changed as desired.

Let`s write CSS above and give an example.

```css
.borderradius #content {
border: 1px solid #141414;
-webkit-border-radius: 12px;
-moz-border-radius: 12px;
border-radius: 12px;
}

.boxshadow #content {
border: none;
-webkit-box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0, .5) 3px 3px 6px;
-moz-box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0, .5) 3px 3px 6px;
box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0, .5) 3px 3px 6px;
}
```

The first CSS requires the #content element to add a round edge size of 12px. However, for `#content`, we have already specified a perimeter of 2px outset #666.

This style (outset) looks good when the edges of the outline are angled, but may look a little awkward if you change to round edges.

However, Modernizr allows you to render the outline 1px solid only if a particular browser supports `border-radius`.

The second CSS adds drop shadow to the #content element and removes the outline if a specific browser supports the box-shadow property.

Why do I have to do this?

This is because most browsers do not render a combination of border with border-radius, but box-shadow does a great job of rendering.

Here, you can use drop shadow to make all CSS look the best rather than just using the outline.

In other words, a browser that supports box-shadow will render the drop shadow properly, a browser that supports border-radius will show a rounded edge with a thin outline, and if neither is supported, it will show the original 2px outset outline.

Next, the header tag defines the user-specific font (page #2) as shown below.

```css
h1 {
color: #e33a89;
font: 27px/27px Baskerville, Palatino, "Palatino Linotype", "Book Antiqua", Georgia, serif;
margin: 0;
text-shadow: #aaa 5px 5px 5px;
}
```

The CSS above works well, so the font size of 27px will look good on all letters.

But if you use a font called Beautiful, it will look relatively small.

To use this Beautiful font, add CSS as shown below.

```css
@font-face {
src: url(Beautiful-ES.ttf);
font-family: "Beautiful";
}

.fontface h1 {
font: 42px/50px Beautiful;
text-shadow: none;
}
```

First, let`s assign path, filename, and font-family properties for the fonts added through the @font-face declaration and assign them to the h1 element with a larger font size.

This is because the Beautiful font you add is rendered much smaller than the other fonts you specify on the h1 element, so only when you render this font should the browser render the heading tag much larger.

And Beautiful font has some problems rendering text-shadow, so if your browser renders this font, it will be removed.

Next, you want to use the CSS columns property.

Of course, because not all browsers support the CSS columns property yet, the float property should be used for unsupported.

```css
.csscolumns ol.features {
-moz-column-count: 2;
-webkit-columns: 2;
-o-columns: 2;
columns: 2;
}

.no-csscolumns ol.features {
float: left;
margin: 0 0 20px;
}

.no-csscolumns ol.features li {
float: left;
width: 180px;
}
```

If your browser supports the CSS columns property, you can get the desired results without any problems, but if you don`t, you can change it to float layout for results similar to those in the column, which you have added a "no-cssscolumns" CSS class to the <html> element.

In addition, columns must use verdor prefixes in Opera browsers, and in Mozilla, the -moz-column-count property is not yet recognized as a shortened property called columns.

Check out the page (#3 version) you have implemented in the example so far.

Lastly, let`s add more sophisticated features.

Webkit-based browsers support great features such as CSS transitions, animations, and 3D transforms, and let`s try some of them here.

Some of these properties can be easily added and ignored by unsupported browsers, some of which can break the layout of all browsers.

In this case, Modernizr provides effective control.

First, set it up as below.

```css
@-webkit-keyframes spin {
0% { -webkit-transform: rotateY(0); }
100% { -webkit-transform: rotateY(360deg); }
}
.csstransforms3d.cssanimations section {
-webkit-perspective: 1000;
}
```

`@keyframes` is one of the new CSS Animations specs, previously supported only by Webkit engine browsers, but is now supported by both modern browsers.

With this attribute alone, you can declare (similar to a function) the entire animation and make changes at any stage.

When you want to apply CSS Animation, you can specify durations, loop counts, and aging curves, but it should be noted that you do not specify durations here in @keyframes. This allows you to specify different speeds for different elements, allowing you to reuse specific animations for maximum flexibility.

For more information on animations, see the W3C Working Draft Specification.

The following applies an animation to allow the element `<h2>` to rotate the element in 3D space:

```css
.csstransforms3d.cssanimations section h2 {
background-image: url(modernizr-logo.png);
overflow: hidden;
-webkit-animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
}
```

The above CSS will rotate the image in 3D space, so we will replace it with a PNG version to use the anti-aliased modernizer logo as a background image.

The text-indent offset is also treated (#3 version) as -99999px to hide text within the heading element.

Finally, apply an animation to set it to 2 seconds and rotate it in an infinite loop with a linear pattern.

The final page will look like this (#4 version).

Thus, animation techniques are available in the Webkit engine browser.

### at the end

Modernizer gives you better control of your web browser and contributes to incremental (step-by-step) enhancements.

What we`ve described here is not everything about Modernizer, but it will be a very important guide to using the new cool properties of HTML5, CSS3.

The next posting will cover Detectizr, which detects the device.

Detectizer is an extended library of Modernizer that detects all existing devices and provides users with that information.
