call method

The first parameter in the call method refers to the object that was created (passed over) by this.

Therefore, the value can be obtained by approaching in this.propertyName form.

This is the purpose and characteristic of the call method.

In the first parameter, write an object that you want to refer to as this. If ES3 does not write the first parameter or null, it uses a global object (window on a browser basis).

The semi-named ES5 uses the parameter values as they are.

However, ES5 also uses global objects without errors, which are considered to be compatible with older versions of code.

However, in strict mode, errors occur without using global objects.

Then write a value to pass to the function called in the second parameter. A number of parameters can be created, separated by commas.

Returns the value returned by the called function.

### Typical Code

```js
var value = 100;

function get(one) {
return one + this.value;
}

// The get function of the global object is called because the object was not created before the get function
// specify this for the first parameter, this refers to the global object
// so the object to which the get function belongs is the same as the object to which this references.
var result = get.call(this, 50);

console.log(result); // 150
```

### The shape in which you specified an explicit object in the first parameter.

```js
var value = 100,
base = 10,
rate = 5;

var get = function(value) {
return this.base * this.rate + value;
};

// Create an explicit object in the first parameter
var result = get.call({base:20, rate:30}, 50)

console.log(result); // 650;

// specify this, which is a common form, such as the first example code
var result2 = get.call(this, 10);
console.log(result2); // 60
```

The ability to specify objects in the first parameter means that instances made with new operators, array objects, can be specified.

### Change the object this references when calling a function

The ability to assign an object to the first parameter of the call method means that the parameter value allows you to adjust the object referenced by this.

```js
var value = 'window';

var sports = {
value : 123,
soccer: {
value: 456,
get : function() {
return this.value;
}
}
};

// Common Call Form in get method
console.log(sports.soccer.get()); // 456

// use call()
console.log(sports.soccer.get.call(sports)); // 123
console.log(sports.soccer.get.call(sports.soccer)) // 456
console.log(sports.soccer.get.call(this)); // window
```
