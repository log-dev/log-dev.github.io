Definition

> Object Oriented Programming is the way you work with problems divided into multiple object units.
This is the most popular programming method today, and JAVA, C#, etc. are representative object-oriented programming languages.

Object-Oriented Programming Features and Advantages

> The most distinctive feature of object-oriented programming is that it uses the class to create and use objects (instances) by combining the associated processing parts (functions) and data parts (variables)
In addition, object-oriented programming allows projects to be separated into independent object units, so it is possible to collaborate with many developers to carry out large projects and has the advantage of excellent maintenance.

Object-Oriented Programming VS Class-Based Programming

You may think that class-wise programming and object-oriented programming are the same content.

To start with the conclusion, some of them are correct and some of them are not.

### Interpreting in a strict sense

Object-oriented programming is commonly referred to as object-oriented programming, which uses four characteristics of object-oriented programming: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Class-wise programming refers to a method of coding using only classes without using any of these object-oriented features. As such, these two are completely different programming methods.

### Interpreting in a flexible sense

Class-wise coding can be called object-oriented programming because it already uses encapsulation and concealment among the four characteristics of object-oriented programming to create and code classes. As such, class-based programming has a structure that is included in object-oriented programming.

In order to learn object-oriented programming, you must be familiar with class-based programming. This is because the means of creating objects is the class (creator function).
