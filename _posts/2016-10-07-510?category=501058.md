hoisting: Problems with distributed var declarations

JavaScript allows multiple `var` declarations to be used here and there in the function, but in reality they all behave the same way as variables are declared at the top of the function.

This behavior is called hoisting.

Therefore, using a variable in a function and then declaring it can cause logic errors.

JavaScript considers variables within the same valid range (i.e., the same function) to be declared even before var declaration.

Let`s take a look at the following examples:

```js
'// Anti-Pattern
name = 'global ; // global variable
function func() {
console.log(name); // 'undefined' is recorded.
var name = 'local';
console.log(name); // 'local' is logged.
}
func();
```

This example makes it easy to expect `global` to be output as a result of the first console and `local` to be output in the second.

At the time the first console is output, the name has not been declared yet, so you should expect to look at the global variable name.

However, this is not the case.

The first console will output `undefined`.

Because name is considered declared as the region variable for this function.

Even if the declaration itself comes next.

All variable declarations are raised to the top of the function.

Therefore, to avoid this confusion, it is recommended that you declare all the variables you want to use in the first line.

This will behave the same way you wrote the following code:

```js
name = 'global';
function func() {
var name; // If you write a variable declaration like this, it is the same as writing var name = undefined;.
console.log(name); // 'undefined' is recorded.
name = 'local';
console.log(name); // 'local' is logged.
}
func();
```

### Conclusion

You need to know that the actual implementation steps are more complex.

The code will be processed in two stages.

In the first step, variables, function declarations, and type parameters are generated, parsing the code and entering the execution context.

The second step is the run-time code execution step, which generates function expressions and unspecified identifiers (undeclared variables).

However, it would be easy to use the hoisting concept in practice.

This concept is not actually defined in the ECMAScript standard, but is widely used to describe how code behaves.
