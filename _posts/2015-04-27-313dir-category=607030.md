Learn about the heading elements that make up the title of the document. With HTML5 specification, you can create a structured outline, just like creating a table of contents.

### Headlines

When sections are created and the contents are grouped, appropriate titles should be given to facilitate easy and quick understanding. The title required for web content production is as follows.

This corresponds to the element <title> as the title of the document.

<h1> to be the title of the compartmentalized contents.This corresponds to the element `<h6`.

This corresponds to the `<label>` element as the title of the control element.

This is the title of the table or image, and the elements `<captions>` and `figcaptions>`.

### Elements H1~H6

The elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 indicate heading.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<title>page title</title>
</head>
<body>
<header>
<h1>Site Logo</h1>
</header>
<main>
<h2>Content Title</h2>
<p>Contents</p>
<h3>Comments</h3>
</main>
<aside>
<h3>Advertising</h3>
</aside>
</body>
</html>

```

- A heading is a title for compartmentalized content, such as a page, section, paraphrases, or chapter, usually located at the beginning of the content.
- It is divided into six stages according to its importance, and the importance is assigned in order from h1 to h6 elements. Giving heading means ranking content based on importance.
- The browser expresses the high-importance heading in larger and bold letters than the low-importance heading, and the screen reader expresses the importance of the heading as an auditory hierarchy through the heading level. In particular, screen readers can skip from heading to heading, so they can find what they want without reading the text.
- We assign the h1 element to the title of the most important content.
- Elements h2â€“h6 are given according to their importance, allowing the importance of heading to be followed in turn.

The object of the h1 element is controversial. Some give the h1 element to the site name (logo), and others give the title (content title). In the case of the former, it is more convenient to move within the document, but there is a difficulty in digesting the text with only the h2~h6 elements. If the composition of the body is complex, the difficulty becomes greater, and at this time, the scope of use of heading is desirable only for the body.

### HGROUP Element

The hgroup element was removed from the W3C specification.
