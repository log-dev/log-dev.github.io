It covers a general description of the /dev directory that exists on Linux computers.

### /dev ?

Linux operating systems have a special directory called `/dev` for `device files`. This directory contains an element called a node, each representing a device in the system.

A node can be a real hardware device or a virtual device, either way, the purpose of listing it as part of a file system is to facilitate I/O interaction with a program or service.

### Device Type

The device file name consists of a prefix conventionally defined by the driver type, and a number or character that is used selectively only if there are more than one device of the same type.

The most common device-type device file prefixes include:

- cdrom : CD, DVD-ROM drive
- fd : floppy disk drive
- hd : device connected by IDE, such as a hard drive or CD-ROM
- md : Meta-disk and RAID devices such as hard drives
- ram : RAM disk
- sd : SCSI-connected mass storage device
- usb : USB connected device

### Virtual appliance

Some of the devices in the /dev directory do not correspond to actual hardware devices, but are instead referred to as "pseudo devices" because they make it easier for managers and developers to input and output specific resources.

null device

The virtual device is also nicknamed the "black hole" because it is designed to ignore all data sent to the device. Writing to this device always completes successfully, and reading from this device does not cross any data.

It is particularly useful when ignoring the output of a program so that no text is displayed on the screen.

```bash
cat shopping.txt > /dev/null

```

Random number generator

Stream generating random flow. While /dev/random generates real random numbers, /dev/urandom provides a pseudo-random number. It is also possible to write to this device for the purpose of filling the entropy pool.

Because the data generated is binary, the numbers from /dev/random and /dev/urandom cannot be displayed in the console terminal. Most of these devices are used by developers who want to collect reliable random numbers.

Full device

Because this virtual device is always considered full, writing to this device returns errors, and reading returns null characters indefinitely.

The purpose of the /dev/full device is to provide programmers and administrators with tasks that cause intentional errors.

```bash
echo Hello! > /dev/full

~bash: echo: write error: No space left on device

```

zero device

Zero virtual devices are so similar to null devices that they always provide a successful return code when written. But when I read it, I print out your text indefinitely.

Reading /dev/zero devices is very useful in many ways, such as providing input data to programs that create files of a certain size or write to format a storage device.
