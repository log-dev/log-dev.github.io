For-in loop and enumeration

The `for-in` loop should only be used when traversing objects rather than arrays.

Turning loops with `for-in` is also known as enumeration.

In JavaScript, because an array is an object, you can technically use a fon-in loop when you traverse an array, but it is not recommended.

If a user-defined feature has been added to an array object, there is room for logical errors.

In addition, for-in does not have an order in which to enumerate the properties.

Therefore, it is desirable to use a typical `for` statement for an array and a for-in statement for objects only.

### Traversing the Properties of an Object

When traversing an object`s properties, you must use the `hasOwnProperty()` method to filter out the properties inherited along the prototype chain.

Take a look at the following example:

```js
// Object Definition
var person = {
hand: 2,
legs: 2,
head: 1
};

// Let's say somewhere in the code, all objects have one method added:
if (typeof Object.prototype.clone === 'undefined') {
Object.prototype.clone = function () {
// Skip method logic
};
}
```

In this example, you used object literals to define a simple object named person.

Before or after defining person, when a method named `clone()` is conveniently added to an Object prototype, changes to the prototype chain are reflected in real time, so all objects can automatically use this new method.

To prevent the clone() method from appearing when enumerating person, you must call hasOwnProperty() to filter out prototype properties.

If you don`t filter it like this, you`ll get a clone(), which in most cases is not desirable.

```js
'// 1. For-in # Good pattern
for (var prop in person) {
If (person.hasOwnProperty(prop) {/filter prototype properties.
console.log(prop, ":", person[prop]);
}
}
// The output to the console is as follows.
/*
hand: 2,
legs: 2,
head: 1
*/


// 2. For-in # Anti-pattern (unless hasOwnProperty is verified)
for (var prop in person) {
console.log(prop, ":", person[prop]);
}
// The output to the console is as follows.
/*
hand: 2,
legs: 2,
head: 1
clone : () {
// Skip method logic
}
*/
```

Calling `hasOwnProperty()` in Object.prototype is another pattern.

```js
for (var prop in person) {
if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(person, prop)) {
console.log(prop, ":", person[prop]);
}
}
```

The advantage of this method is that it can be exploited even if the person object is overwritten by overriding hasOwnProperty.

If you don`t want the property search to go far back to the object, you can use a local variable to "cache" this method as shown in the code below.

```js
var prop,
hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;

for (prop in person) {
if (hasOwn.call(person,prop) { // filter out
console.log(prop, ":", person[prop]);
}
}
```

If you want to modify the above code in its format (although it may not be able to use JSLint), there is a way to omit parentheses and put if statements in the same line.

This has the advantage of being read as a complete idea of a loop expression.

In other words, "If an element has a Property X, it does something with an X."

It also reduces indentation to the core of the loop.

```js
var prop,
hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;

for (prop in person) if (hasOwn.call(person, prop)) { // filter
console.log(prop, ":", person[prop]);
}
```
