# Layout Design - Float Layout

Find out the representative layout techniques, Floating and Positioning, and the modern layout Flexbox and
Let`s learn about grid layout. First, learn about the floating layout.

Normal Layout Flow

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="371" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/GPgdyY?height=371&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=GPgdyY&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=normal%20layout&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="normal layout" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_GPgdyY"></iframe>

The general layout flow is that the CSS is listed from top to bottom on a non-reflected screen.
In the HTML code markup above, after the <h1> element, the titles and paragraphs appear in the order of the <p> element.
This is how the web browser interprets HTML documents and draws them on the screen.

### Floating Layout

The CSS `float` property is a property that is used a lot especially in the process of layout design within domestic practice.

The core attributes needed to construct complex layouts that allow certain elements to float, flow, and enrich.

In other words, a layout technique that uses the float property to "rich" the box left (left) or right (right).

The meaning `rich` here refers to the element moving away from the basic flow of document placement and the edge of the element moving to the left or right of the page.

This floating model provides flexibility in screen placement regardless of document flow.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="441" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/dwPKJL?height=441&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=dwPKJL&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=%ED%94%8C%EB%A1%9C%ED%8C%85%20%EC%83%98%ED%94%8C&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="플로팅 샘플" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_dwPKJL"></iframe>

```css
.box {
float: value;
}
```

The following is the property value of float:

- left : set element to float in left direction
- right : set element to float right
- none : default, do not float element.

### Clear - Floating Release Technique

Because the plotted elements are out of the document`s flow, you will see a phenomenon that breaks down the layout.
This is what happens when you use plots and you need to release float to solve these problems.

where "release float" means not releasing elements with float applied.
This means that the clear property is applied so that it is not affected by float.

There is a method called `clearfix` which is a globally accepted name (the name of a tolerable technique).

Of course, you can turn off the plot in a different way than applying the `clear` attribute, but if you use float to get the layout, we recommend that you apply the clearfix method to the parent element of the plotted element as much as possible.

In other words, there are approximately six ways to solve the phenomenon in which the parent element cannot embrace the child element with `float`.
One of the most popular methods is `clearfix`.

In other words, the clearfix method is not unconditional but necessary.

```css
.clearfix { clear: value; }
```

The value of the `clear` property is as follows:

- left : Unspecified floating element on the left
- right : unspecified floating element on right
- bot : Unspecified elements that are both left and right floated
- none : default, do not disable floating

### Look before and after releasing plots

To turn off the first float

```css
.parent { float: left; }
```

If the plotted element is a child element, the parent element will look like a collapsed layout due to its inability to wrap the child element (out of document flow). This is what happens when a plot is used, and to solve this problem, it is necessary to avoid being affected by the plot.

In other words, if the parent element contains a plotted child element, the parent element is not aware of the height.

One of the solutions to this problem is to reflect the float property on the parent (contingent element) as well.

This will make the parent element aware of the height of the child element, but the parent element also becomes a float element and has the characteristics of the inline block, so it should be used contextually according to the visual design layout.

To turn off the second float

This method also applies to parent elements by using the attribute `display:inline-block;`.

The parent element becomes aware of the height of the child element, but because of the inline block attribute characteristics defined in the parent element, it is only as wide as its own area.

```css
.parent { display: inline-block; }
```

To release the third float

The third property to turn off the plot is the `overflow:hidden;` method.

This property should also be applied to parent elements, which are characterized by the properties that hide the contents of the child element box and make it invisible if the child element is larger than the parent element box.

You can apply `overflow: auto;`, but it is not recommended because scrolling occurs when the width of the child element box is greater than the width of the parent element box.

It`s a property that hides overflowing things according to overflow characteristics, and it also contains other meanings.

Hiding overflowing content means that the parent element box hides the child element content.

However, when the parent element is not aware of the height due to the plotted child element, the `overflow: hidden;` attribute is applied, and the parent element (containment box) tries to hide the excess element and automatically calculates the height to recognize the child element height.

```css
.parent { overflow: hidden; }
```

### To turn off the fourth float

This approach has a method of applying the clear attribute by creating an empty element as the last element (brother level) of an element plotted in the way that was widely used in the past (now the sun).

```undefined
<div class="box-group">
<div class="box is-blue"></div>
<div class="box is-yellow"></div>
<div class="box is-green"></div>
<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
```

### To release the fifth float

One of the most widely used techniques we`ve introduced is how to use CSS` virtual (Sudo-class, pseudo-class) classes.

The method we introduced earlier required the creation of unnecessary meaningless elements, but this method is to disable float by creating empty virtual elements through CSS.

Use `:after` among the virtual elements of CSS.

```css
.parent:after {
content: "";
display:block;
clear:both;
}
```

To release the sixth float

The last way I introduce you is a technique called micro clearfix.

This method was first introduced through the HTML5 Boiler Plate template engine as a micro clearfix hack designed by CSS research expert Nicholas Gallagher.

It was designed in 2011, but has since become popular with bootstrap (Ver.1-3).

```css
.parent {
/* For IE 6/7 only */
*zoom: 1;
}
.parent:before,
.parent:after {
content: "";
display: table;
}
.parent:after {
clear:both;
}
```

Positioning

We`re going to cover one of the CSS layouts, Positioning
In the positioning layout, learn about the properties of `position` and related `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and `z-index`.

The floating layout that you have learned earlier can usually be used to build a large frame, but you need to use a technique called positioning for detailed layout operations. Positioning is used to position in a dictionary sense and to override the default layout flow (Normal Layout Flow) rendered by the web browser to specify a detailed location.

For example, if you want to represent UI elements floating on top of other parts of a page, or if you want to create UI elements that are always located in the same place in the browser window, regardless of the scrolling on the page.

Positioning Layout Type

- Static Location: Default
- Relative Position
- Absolute location
- Fixed Position
- Sticky location: IE browser not supported, but can be implemented using JavaScript in IE9 and later.

```css
.element {
position:relative;
left:50px;
top:10px;
z-index:1;
}
```

### static

`static` is the default, which specifies the position in order according to the flow of the document.
This value is the same as when you do not specify a location as the default (initial) value that the element has, and you do not usually use static, but you can use it if you want to ignore the offset property value of the position.
Because it is the default, the block-level element creates a square box contained in the document flow, the inline-level box generates one or more lines of line boxes contained in the parent element flow, and the top, bottom, left, right property values are not applied.

### relative

`relative` moves its position relatively in a dictionary sense.
If so, the relative position `relative` will move the general flow to the reference point by whom it is the relative position.
For example, `{left:20}` causes the element box to move for a certain distance, leaving 20 pixels on the left side of the element.
What`s important here is that in HTML`s default layout flow, when an element is plotted, the element box below recognizes that there is no box on top (the element with the plot applied) and goes up, but if you use `position:relative;`, the element before it moves in its original position.
This means maintaining the default layout flow.
When cleaned up, the element`s existing space before setting the offset value is retained (the property of moving over the existing space (the alteration), so that space is occupied by that element as well. If you do not specify a separate offset value, it will behave the same as `static`.

### absolute

The position of the element`s first parent element (except static) determines its position.
This box of elements completely deviates from the flow of documents, so the space occupied by the element in the flow of the general document disappears as if it did not have a location.
And it is called absolute position because it can be positioned regardless of where the existing element should be.

However, the location is determined based on the element with `relative` or `absolute` applied among the closest parent elements (parent elements).

This means that the coordinate properties of the parent element or `relative` can be moved through the coordinate properties based on the declared element.

If there is no parent element, the location is set based on `html` or `body`. (Different browsers)

### fixed

Fix positioning in the area
This will behave similarly to when set to the absolute value, but will move the location based on the browser screen (viewport).

Elements given `fixed` are positioned relative to the viewport, meaning they are always in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

Like `relative` and `absolute`, it can be controlled by offset values. Therefore, you can always set a fixed position in the same position even if the screen is scrolling and a screen transition occurs.

In other words, the parent (parent) element is not affected.

### top, right, bottom, left

Along with CSS properties learned above, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` can be set to move the location in detail.

In other words, the value of the `position` property moves in relation to the value of `top` / `bottom` / `left` / `right`, while a positive value moves towards the inside of the box area and a negative value moves toward the outside of the box area.

Positive values are as follows:

- `left: 100px` : move to the right relative to the left of the element
- `top: 100px` : Move down relative to the top of the element
- `Right: 100px` : Move left relative to the right of the element
- `BOTTOM: 100px` : Move up relative to the bottom of the element

Negative values are as follows:

- `left: -100px` : move left relative to the left of the element
- `top: -100px` : Move up relative to the top of the element
- `right: -100px` : move to the right relative to the right of the element
- `BOTTOM: -100px` : Move downward relative to the bottom of the element

## z-index

The `z-index` property specifies a sequential location for that element (determining the order of placement of which elements come forward and follow), and the element with the largest number is always at the front (top) of the element.

In other words, `z-index` is a property that controls the order of elements.

The order here is not the two-dimensional order of phase, right, lower, and left, but the three-dimensional order of the z-axis, as shown by the attribute name.

Eventually, the topmost position means the top in the overlap state relative to the z-axis, and the lower the number, the higher the number, the higher the number, the higher the number.
