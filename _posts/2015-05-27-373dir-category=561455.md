If you are using Adobe products, you are familiar with extensions such as PSD (Photo Shop), Ai (Illust), and EPS. This does not support previewing in Explorer, so to check a large number of files, you must install the Image Viewer, etc. and run it every time to avoid the inconvenience of locating the image. SegeThumbs, which will be introduced in this article, can be used to eliminate this inconvenience for free.

### Introducing SageThumbs

SageThumbs is a shell extension feature that allows Windows Explorer to preview many image formats. It has a GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2) license, so it is available free of charge to companies or anywhere.

- It shows an extended preview image in the Explorer folder.
- We show a preview image in the contact menu that calls with a mouse right click.
- Provides extended information tips.
- The GFL library supports 162 image formats (224 extensions).
- If XnView is installed, the plug-in supports an additional 26 image formats.
- I support sending by mail.
- Popular image formats can be converted to one-click.
- It supports designation as a wallpaper.
- It supports copying to the clipboard.

- Windows XP/2003/Vista/2008/7/2012/8/8.1 32/64-bit
- Approximately 5 Mb of disk space and extra space for caching

SageThumbs is a contact menu extension of Windows Explorer, so no executable exists. You can just mouse click on the image file that you want to preview in Windows Explorer.

### Install SageThumbs

Once downloaded and installed, it automatically detects and selects Korean.

To support Adobe`s illustrators, PostScript, Acrobat, and Photoshop, you must install the Ghostscript library below.

- 32비트 : AFPL Ghostscript 8.54 32-bit (gs854w32.exe)
- 64비트 : AFPL Ghostscript 8.54 64-bit (gs854w64.exe)

### Troubleshooting SageThumbs

To resolve unwanted SageThumbs extensions (i.e. to conflict with other thumbnail programs or to release a thumbnail of a particular format):

- Go to the option on SageThumbs, and turn off the list of supported file types (I am using XnviewMP with only AI, PSD, EPS, PDF).
- Restore file extension connections using the default application or Windows Control Panel.
- Use the Windows Delete Manager (cleanmgr.exe) to delete the Windows thumbnail cache (enter cleanmgr.exe in the execution window).
- Reboot
