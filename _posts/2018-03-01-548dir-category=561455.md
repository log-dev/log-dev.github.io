Introducing a program called cmder that makes it easier, more visible, and visually beautiful to the existing Windows console.

### cmder introduction

cmder is a software package created from the sheer frustration of not having a console emulator available on Windows. We make key settings based on Conemu, use Mononaki color schemes, add amazing Clink features, and provide customizable prompt layouts.

The strength of cmder is that it is provided as a portable. It can be self-designed and loaded onto USB or cloud storage without any external dependencies, carrying consoles, alias, and binaries anywhere.

### Install Cmder

The download links provided on the homepage allow users to download full versions (compressed 7z versions) and non-mini versions that include Git-for-Windows.

- Download the version you want from the homepage and extract it.
- The cmder folder may be moved to the desired location, but not to "C:\Program Files" or to a path that requires administrator privileges (the author was placed in a "C:\Users\user name" similar to the home directory on the Linux computer).
- Run as Cmder.exe.

Because the mini version of Cmder does not include Git-for-Windows, the bash commands cannot be used in CMD. This requires a full version or a separate installation of Git-for-Windows.

### Add Cmder Contact Menu

Some Windows applications include menus that are integrated into the right mouse button during installation, and cmder also provides this. For cmder, add the ability to open cmder in the selected folder.

- Open CMD with administrator privileges.
- Go to the directory where Cmder is located.
- Run `.\cmder.exe /REGISTER ALL` (If access is denied, make sure CMD is run with administrator privileges).

Cmder Here is registered when you right-click a directory in the Windows Explorer window.

### Delete Cmder

Since it is made of pobble, uninstallers are not provided separately. However, the registry remains, so you have to delete it yourself.

- If Cmder Contact menu was added, `cmder.exe /UNREGISTER ALL` will be executed.
- `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\Cmder`를 제거한다.
- `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell\Cmder`를 제거한다.

### Cmder Settings

Most people in Korea can`t avoid this problem because they will use Hangul Windows. The default Korean Windows is set to ANSI, so you need to change it. Hangeul cannot be properly written in the basic setting as shown below.

Press the menu button in the lower right corner of the Cmder to display the menu and select Setting.

Let`s choose the font part of `Main` as the desired font and choose the font charset as Hangul. If you don`t have a font for coding, try using D2 Coding 1.3.

Enter `set LANG=ko_KR.UTF-8` and `chcputf-8` in the `Environment` field.

When you restart and check Cmder, Korean writing is done normally.

If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), try adding it. You can also add other shells using this method.

First, `Tasks` window is called up with Win + Alt + T.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99272D3A5A8FE53138)

- Click the + button at the bottom and add a new task.
- Enter the Task name. It is written as `bash::ubuntu` and `ubuntu` is recognized as a group name. Cmder is basically a bash group, and includes minty (Cygwin) and git-for-windows, respectively. Write the group and name according to your taste.
- Task parameters can set icon settings such as `/icon"%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\lxss\bash."ico" is WSL`s bash.I should be able to find ico, but I failed. So I set up the icon dry separately and ubuntu.I downloaded and used ico.
- In the Command Input field, enter the command to be performed at the beginning of this operation. The bash call is equivalent to `%windir%\system32\bash.exe to -cur_console:p`.

The shell setup file provided by cmder allows user-only setup. You can add your own configuration by editing the file below.

| Shell | Cmder Portable User Config |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Cmder | %CMDER\_ROOT%\config\user-profile.cmd |
| PowerShell | $ENV:CMDER\_ROOT\config\user-profile.ps1 |
| Bash/Mintty | $CMDER\_ROOT/config/user-profile.sh |

You can add a Cmder startup configuration by writing a .cmd|.bat, *.ps1, and *.sh script and placing it in the folder "%CMDER_ROOT%\config\profile.d".

| Shell | Cmder 'Profile.d' Scripts |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Cmder | %CMDER\_ROOT%\config\profile.d\\*.bat and \*.cmd |
| PowerShell | $ENV:CMDER\_ROOT\config\profile.d\\*.ps1 |
| Bash/Mintty | $CMDER\_ROOT/config/profile.d/\*.sh |

### Aliases

Using commands such as `alias desired name = command`, `cmd`.A simple alias can be defined for exe` sessions. The cmd.exe alias supports optional parameters through the special characters `$1-9` or `$*`, so the alias entered as `vi [file name]` is called `vi=vim.exe $*`, which causes the vim.exe to call the file name.

The cmd.exe alias could be more complicated, but DOSKEY.Read more about complex aliases/macroes in EXE documentation.

Aliases defined using the alias.bat command are automatically stored in the file "%CMDER_ROOT%\config\user-aliases.cmd".

To create aliases and other profile settings permanently, add them to one of the following:

These are loaded sequentially by `$CMDER_ROOT/vendor/init.bat`. What is stored in `%CMDER_ROOT%` is a portable setting and follows cmder on other computers.

- %CMDER_ROOT%\config\profile.d\*.cmd 과 *.bat
- %CMDER_ROOT%\config\user-aliases.cmd
- %CMDER_ROOT%\config\user-profile.cmd

Bash shells operate slightly differently, using optional parameters to natively support simple and complex aliases. If `alias desired name = command` is entered, alias is created only for currently running sessions.

To create aliases and other profile settings permanently, add them to one of the following:

These are loaded by the command `$CMDER_ROOT/vendor/git-for-windows/etc/profile.d/cmder.sh`. What is stored in `$CMDER_ROOT` is a portable setting and follows cmder on other computers.

- $CMDER_ROOT/config/profile.d/*.sh
- $CMDER_ROOT/config/user-profile.sh
- $HOME/.bashrc

If you add a bash alias to `$CMDER_ROOT/config/user-profile.sh`, copy it to another machine and follow the cmder, but `$HOME/.Aliases defined in `bashrc` do not.

PowerShell originally supported simple aliases such as the "[new-alias | set-alias] alias command", but complex aliases using optional parameters are not supported in PowerShell sessions. Type `get-help [new-alias|set-alias] -full` to get help with PowerShell aliases.

To create aliases and other profile settings permanently, add them to one of the following:

These are loaded sequentially by `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT\vendor\user-profile.ps1`. What is stored in `$ENV:CMDER_ROOT` is a portable setting and follows cmder on other computers.

- $ENV:CMDER_ROOT\config\profile.d\*.ps1
- $ENV:CMDER_ROOT\config\user-profile.ps1

### SSH Agent

To start SSH included with Git for Windows, simply call `start-ssh-agent` in the `vendor/git-for-windows/cmd` folder.

If you want SSH to run when you start Cmder, add @call "%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%/cmd/start-ssh-agent.cmd" within "%CMDER_ROOT%/config/user-profile.cmd".`

### Version with Git

Cmder is basically loaded with Git installations and distributed (full version). To find out if another Git binary is being provided in each instance starting Cmder, and to find the `git.exe` binary, Cmder compares the version with the loaded version. The loaded `git.exe` binary is only used if it is newer than the user installed it.

Its preferred version of Git can be included in `%PATH%` environment variables and used.
