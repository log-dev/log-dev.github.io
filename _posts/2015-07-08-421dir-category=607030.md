As I was working on the project, I got to know a lot about delivering the contents of the form to the `<input type="submit">". I habitually replaced it with a button element, and suddenly I searched because I was curious about the difference between the two, and I organize the contents related to it.

### Is button functionally different?

<input type="submit"> and <button>, which function as a form transfer function, are functionally identical. By default, the button element performs a submit function unless the type attribute is specified. In other words, it is perfect for the purpose of replacing it in a form.

The function of the default button element by browser may vary, so please specify it as much as possible.

- type="submit" : is responsible for the transmission of the form.
- type="reset" : Used to initialize form creation.
- type="button": is commonly used to implement features using JavaScript.

### What are the advantages of the button element?

Above all, it is very free from a design perspective, unlike the input element. Everything that designs common elements can be applied to put images in the background, or to insert other tags between <button> and </button>. In recent years, various libraries can simply use class names to distribute CSSs that apply embellishments to button elements.

### Notes on Button Design

Instead of using the default value of the button for cross-browsing, it is designed and used as a CSS. Basically, we proceed to initialize on IE8 and later and other universally used attributes to work well in modern browsers.

- display: inline-block - uses the `text-align` property of the parent element to determine the alignment of the buttons.
- font-family: inherit - Force inheritance of fonts that are not inherited by button elements
- Vertical-align: Middle - Contrast vertical center alignment when encountering other elements
- cursor: pointer - finger mark on cursor
- white-space: nowrap - button is not broken when it is small.
- text-decoration: none - Remove the underscore of the letter
- background: transparent - transparent default background color
- Border: none - initializes border properties.
- outline: 0 - Remove outline created at focus

### How about replacing element a?

Except for form, the `a` element is an anchor, primarily a link between documents, a URI reference, and the `button` element is a click to generate events. The use of the button element is a shortcut to semantic markups to mark up basic links for purposes and to implement functions (e.g., pop-up windows, hide or show elements, etc.).
