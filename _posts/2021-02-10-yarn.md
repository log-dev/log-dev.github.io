Let`s use Yarn, the JavaScript package manager created by Facebook.

# Install Yarn

Yarn supports installation of various OS.

## macOS

Installation with Homebrew

```bash
$ brew install yarn

```

If you need to use versioning tools such as NVM, exclude the installation of Node.js.

```bash
$ brew install yarn --without-node

```

## Windows

Installation with Chocolatey

```bash
$ choco install yarn

```

Installation with Scoop

```bash
$ scoop install yarn

```

## NPM

You can also install it as an NPM.

```bash
$ npm install -g yarn

```

Verify that the installation is successful.

```bash
$ yarn --version

```

If there is a problem with global use after installation, you need to set up Path.

`.profile`, `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` 등…

```bash
$ export PATH="$PATH:/opt/yarn-[version]/bin"

```

# How to use Yarn

It`s not difficult if you use NPM.

To initialize when you start a project (create `package.json`)

```bash
$ yarn init

```

To install the dependency module from `package.json`

```bash
$ yarn
# or
$ yarn install

```

To install a dependency module

```bash
$ yarn add [package]
$ yarn add [package]@[version]
$ yarn add [package]@[tag]

```

To add dependencies of other categories such as devDependencies, peerDependencies, and optionalDependencies

```bash
$ yarn add [package] --dev
$ yarn add [package] --peer
$ yarn add [package] --optional

```

To upgrade a dependency module

```bash
$ yarn upgrade [package]
$ yarn upgrade [package]@[version]
$ yarn upgrade [package]@[tag]

```

To remove a dependency module

```bash
$ yarn remove [package]

```

# yarn.lock

The `Yarn.lock` file stores the version of the installed module, making it dependent on the same version and structure everywhere.
In Yarn, yarn.lock is automatically created whenever `yarn install`.
It`s similar to `package-lock.json`.
