Let`s find out what is frequently used in html and its characteristics.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/9942043E5C22E4AD1E)

## HTML Sections Elements

Let`s learn how to structure documents or sites, each section of an application, and the main area.

The `body` element in the document can be a root (=root section) of any element present in it.
The reason why it is called root section is because it is the root of all the elements that exist in this body.
And this body section can have `header` and `footer`, respectively.
Typically, within the header, it includes things like logos, navigation, searches, and so on, and for the main content pages you view, you can use the element `main`.
In the bottom area, `footer` can be entered, including navigation, information on the site, copyright, etc.
The navigation role can use the `<nav>` (navigation section) element.
There is a generic section, which is usually used for categorizing categories, in which you can use articles such as blogs and articles in newspapers as an article section.
And there`s an `aside` element that can be used as an auxiliary means, and this aside can have something like an ad (banner).

### Sections Elements

Section elements are typical container elements (ex. such as grouping in Photoshop), and there is a rule that it is only appropriate as a section element if it is explicitly listed in the document outline.
If a typical container element is intended to be grouped for expression purposes (simple binding), the section element can be a section that corresponds to each category`s topic. Typical container elements include `div` and `span`.

section

The `<section>` element refers to a typical section of a document, application.
Sections in this context are grouped by topic, which can be divided into sections for grouping content, for example, introduction, news items, notification, and contact information.
Also, if the content has a strong tendency to be an independent section of the site, it is recommended that you use the article element instead of the section element.

article

The `article` element refers to an independent section of a document, page, application, site, etc.
For example, magazines, newspapers, papers, essays, reports, blogs, and other novel media can be used as an article element.
Typical rules are only appropriate if the content of an article element is explicitly listed in the document outline, and each article element should typically be identified by including a title (elements h1 through h6) as a child of the element.
If the article does not contain headings, it will be difficult to determine what this article is about.
The general section element <section> may contain <article> and vice versa <article> may contain <section> elements <section>.

aside

The `aside` element refers to a sub-content (separate from the main content) section, which is not the main content but the secondary content, i.e. the sidebar on the website. Advertising (banner) is often used.

nav

The `<nav>` element refers to navigation and uses it as a section element containing links to other pages or links to in-site navigation.
This element uses the non-sequential `<ul` element inside the nav element for easy understanding of the content.
You do not need to include all the links in your site in nav, primarily links that navigate your site.
The link located at the bottom of the site does not matter much if it is only used as a footer element.

header

`<header>` 요소는 일반적으로 섹션의 제목, 목차, 검색, 로고 등을 포함하는데 사용합니다.
하지만 article 내에서도 내용이 많다면 header 요소를 사용하여 묶어줄 수 있습니다.

footer

The <footer> element is typically used to include author, link, copyright information, etc. of a section.
Also, the footer does not have to be located only at the bottom, and if there is a need to go to the top, it is okay to be located at the top.

main

The `main` element corresponds to the main content of the document or application body element.
The main element is not a section element and must not have more than two visible elements.
The unused main elements must be treated as hidden on the screen.
The section, article, aside, and nav elements cannot contain the main elements as children, but the main elements may contain the section elements.
The main does not directly contain the header, footer elements.

```undefined
<main><section></section></main>

<main>
<section>
<header></header>
</section>
</main>

<main hidden></main>
<main hidden></main>
```

```undefined
<section><main></main></section>

<main>
<header></header>
<section></section>
<footer></footer>
</main>
```

## Containers Elements

Container elements are commonly visual representations that do not have meaning, which are intended and enveloped in grouping.
Therefore, these elements should be used when there is no proper semantic element.

- `<div> - Division element, used to divide the blocked area.
- `<span>` - Span element is an inline container that is used to wrap inline elements (a, strong, em, b, i, etc.
In other words, it is a word that means a short area and is used mainly for design expression between inline elements.
Block elements (h1 to h6, p, blockquote, section, etc.) cannot be wrapped.

## Text Level Elements

HTML elements used at the text level include the following elements:

- `<sup> - Upper subscript element
- `<sub> - Subscripts below
- `<abbr> - Shortening Element
- `<s> - Elements that are no longer relevant or are no longer accurate
- `<mark> - Highlighted letter elements for relevant reference purposes
- `<time> - Time Element
- <small> - Copyright, legal text, annotations, and small writing elements

The `<sup>` element (superscript text) is a superscript that is placed in the upper right corner of another letter, which can be used when an abbreviation or footnote is left unattended.

The `sub` element (subscript text) is a small letter placed below the reference line and on the right side of another letter, most often used in chord or mathematical expressions.

The `mark` element is usually used when visually highlighting and displaying search keywords at the end of the screen that users search for.
In other words, it is used for highlighted letter elements for related reference purposes.

`<abbr>` is an abbreviation for Abbreviation and is used to display abbreviations. For example, you can use the terms Insider, Outsider, and Too Much Information (TMI) when you need to provide information for those who don`t know the terms.

The `s` factor (strikethrough) is an element that can be used to cross the price information with a solid line at the list price when you want to display it at a discounted price in a shopping mall or something.
It is not easy to find cases in Korea that utilize this element properly. Although explicitly recommended by technical specifications, this cross-lined solid shape is often treated as a CSS, which is not the right method.

The `<time>` element is an element that represents a date or time in a form that the machine can understand.

```undefined
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
<!-- Markup as above makes it difficult to understand what it's about, so you need to wrap it in definition terms -->
<dfn id="sulfuric-acid">H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></dfn>

In China and Japan, sulfuric acid is called £, and in North Korea, it is also called ryusan.
In Korea, the term "Yusan" is also used, but sulfuric acid is used because it can be mistaken for "Yusan," meaning lactic acid.
It is manufactured most frequently except for water, and is used in many places.
The world's sulfuric acid production in 2001 reached 165 million tons in 2001. It is used in fertilizer manufacturing, ore treatment, wastewater treatment, and petroleum refining.

## Address among grouping elements

Grouping content is used to cover something, and we`ll look at the `address` and `pre` elements.

- `<address>` : Used to provide information about people, organizations (businesses)
This is to provide physical address, digital location, contact information.
- `<pre>` : Preserved text (pre-formatted text)
It is an element that preserves spaces, margins, and so on, such as gaps in code or line breaks.
Use for e-mail, paragraphs with blank lines, lists with lines with bullet points, etc.
Use for displaying computer code (language)
Display ASCII Art
To represent computer code, output, and keyboard blocks, the pre element can be used with the elements `code`, `sam`, and `kbd`.
- Use for e-mail, paragraphs with blank lines, lists with lines with bullet points, etc.
- Use for displaying computer code (language)
- Display ASCII Art

```undefined
<address>
<a href="tel:+82262566500">02-6256-6500</a> <br> of Han River-daero 12-gil, Yongsan-gu, Seoul
Representative: Kim Jae-hee, business number <123456789</a> <br>

## Embedded elements

Let`s learn about content elements such as embedded images, videos, audio, websites, image maps, and SVG vector graphics.

### picture

The `<picture>` element is used to properly display images for different screen environments (smartphones, smart pads, desktops, TVs, etc.).
When using this element, the image requires at least one image and the `<source>` element can be used as a picture child (at least 0).
If the source element is not available, the <img> element is displayed on the screen.
In other words, the older browser shows img and the modern browser identifies and shows the source.

```undefined
"[! -- Example of using the media property -->
<picture>
<source srcset="pen.png" media="(min-width: 600px)">
<img src="pen-narrow.png" alt="Pen">
</picture>

<!-- Example of using type property -->
<picture>
<source srcset="pen.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<img src="pen-narrow.png" alt="Pen">
</picture>
```

### video element

The `video` element is used to include video content.
You can use the src attribute or the <source> element to display one of several video sources.

```undefined
<video src="videofile.mp4" poster="posterimage.jpg">
You are using an older web browser that does not support the HTML5 vvideo </code> element.
£ahref="http://outdatedbrowser.com/koUpdate to the latest browser.
</video>

<!-- Example used to specify multiple media resources for picture, audio, and video elements -->
<video src="videofile.mp4" poster="posterimage.jpg" controls>
<source src="videofile.webm" type="video/webm">
<source src="videofile.ogg" type="video/ogg">
<source src="videofile.mov" type="video/quicktime">
You are using an older web browser that does not support the HTML5 vvideo </code> element.
£ahref="http://outdatedbrowser.com/koUpdate to the latest browser.
</video>
```

When using the video element, if you want to show the poster before you watch the video, you can define it like poster="posterimage.jpg" or guide for older browser users.

The video attribute values include the following:

- src - video file path
- poster - poster image path
- preload - auto (default), settings to preview browser and improve user experience (metadata / video download) [none, metadata, auto]
- controls - play control display settings
- autoplay - AutoPlay Settings
- loop - repeat settings
- muted - mute settings

### audio element

The element `<audio>` is also used similarly to the element `vedio`.
This audio element can also display multiple video sources using the src attribute or the `<source>` element.

```undefined
<audio src="audiofile.mp3">
<p>
You are using an older web browser that does not support the HTML5 aaudio </code> element.
업데이트ref="http://outdatedbrowser.com/koUpdate to the latest browser</a>.
</p>
</audio>
```

- src - audio file path
- volume - volume adjustment (0.0 to 1.0)
- muted - mute settings
- preload - auto (default), settings to preview browser and improve user experience (metadata / video download) [none, metadata, auto]
- controls - play control display settings
- autoplay - AutoPlay Settings
- loop - repeat settings

### track element

The element `<track>` is one that allows subtitles to be displayed when playing video or audio.

```undefined
'<!--Example of use -->
<video src="videofile.mp4" poster="posterimage.jpg">
<track kind="subtitles" src="videofile.ko.vtt" srclang="ko" label="한국어" default>
<track kind="subtitles" src="videofile.en.vtt" srclang="en" label="English">
</video>

<audio src="audiofile.mp3">
<track kind="subtitles" src="audiofile.ko.vtt" srclang="ko" label="한국어">
<track kind="subtitles" src="audiofile.en.vtt" srclang="en" label="English">
</audio>
```

`.vtt` is an abbreviation for video text track and allows you to set the type subtitle, encoding language (ko, en), and set the label value to be displayed in the lower right corner of the player when setting the track.
You can use the default property value if you want something to be seen as the default.

When you create a .vtt file, write WebVTT (subtitle file) at the top, specify each index, and mark it as --> between time and time. And then you can add captions.

### iframe element

The `<iframe>` element is an abbreviation for inline frames and is an element that allows you to display other HTML pages on the screen. This means that the eyeframe is a page in a page and is often used to insert other content within a page.
And for other domains (other service pages), the design cannot be customized (for security reasons), but if it is within the same domain, it is possible.

The properties of the eyeframe are as follows:

- src - Frame Source Settings
- width - frame width setting
- height - setting frame height
- allowfullscreen - Frame Full Screen Settings

```undefined
'<!--Example of use -->
<iframe
width="560" height="315"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Il-an3K9pjg"
frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

<iframe
src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3163.1739210737333!2d126.97054991571503!3d37.55096597980084!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x357b581daaaaaaab%3A0xd16346279906acfb!2zQ0rsmKzrpqzruIzrhKTtirjsm43siqQo7KO8KQ!5e0!3m2!1sko!2skr!4v1543190811185"
width="600" height="450"
frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

### map (image map) element

This `map` is an element used in conjunction with `area` to define an image map (clickable link area).

```undefined
<img src="planets.gif" width="145" height="126" alt="Planets" usemap="#planetmap">
<map name="planetmap">
<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,82,126" alt="Sun" href="sun.html">
<area shape="circle" coords="90,58,3" alt="Mercury" href="mercury.html">
<area shape="circle" coords="124,58,8" alt="Venus" target="_blank" hreflang="en-GB" href="venus.html">
</map>
```

`<area>` can set hotspot region definitions and hyperlinks for images and is only available inside the map.
The usemap property value is set by mapping to the name value using a hash value similar to a hyperlink.

The following property values are available in area:

- shape - set hotspot appearance
- coords - set the coordinate value of the shape
- href - Hyperlink Address Settings
- target - new window (tab) open setting
- alt - Set Alternate Text
- hreflang - setting language properties for linked pages
