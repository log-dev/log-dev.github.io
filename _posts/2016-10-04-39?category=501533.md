Find out this

When creating a function, the keyword "this" is automatically created, which is associated with the object running the function.

This means that JavaScript is an object that is automatically created and inserted when a function is called.

The keyword this refers to an object that can be used within a function`s scope and contains the function as an attribute or method.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2719A53957F2EE681B)

Let`s take a look at the following code.

```js
var cody = {
living : true,
age : 30,
gender: 'male',
getGender : function() {
return this.gender;
}
};

// Invoke methods within an object
console.log (cody.getGender()); // male is recorded.
```

In the code above, this.This of the genders refers to a cody object, an object that currently contains a function. This used within a function usually refers to an object that contains a function, not the function itself. (except when using the new keyword, call(), apply())

And this keyword behaves like a variable except that it cannot be modified.

Let`s take a closer look at how the value of this is determined.

The value of this, which can be used in any function, depends on the context in which the function is called.

You need to look carefully at this part.

Let`s see how this value changes with the following code.

```js
var foo = 'foo';
varobj = {foo: 'foo is a property of obj objects'};

// Define as a function expression
var sayFoo = function() {
console.log(this['foo']);
};

// add the sayFoo function as a property value to the obj object.
obj.fnFoo = sayFoo;

// recall adding function as property to obj object
obj.fnFoo(); // foo is a property of obj objects. It's

// Call functions defined by function expressions
sayFoo(); // foo is recorded
```

If you look at the code above, obj.fnFoo and sayFoo obviously point to the same function, but you can see that this has a different value depending on the context where sayFoo() function was executed.

obj.fnFoo() is the context in which the function executed is obj, the context in which sayFoo() was executed is the global scope, and the object in the global scope is referenced to the global object window object.

The output is foo because var foo = `foo` is defined as a property of a window object.

Again, remember that it refers to an object containing a function (=the value of this depends on the context in which the function is called).
