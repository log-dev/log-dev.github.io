Usually, I use Modernizr a lot, but sometimes I have to implement HTML5 function detection myself when the external library is not used smoothly. I keep it as a record for that time.

### Detection with Element DOM object

Take the context of the canvas element and turn it back to the Boolean value by tricking it with two negative operators.

```js
function supports_canvas() {
return !!document.createElement('canvas').getContext;
}

```

Get the `2d` context of the canvas element and return it to Boolean whether there is a function called fillText.

```js
function supports_canvas_text() {
if(!supports_canvas()) { return false; }

var dummy_canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
var context = dummy_canvas.getContext('2d');
return typeof context.fillText == 'function';
}

```

Take video element canPlayType and turn it back to Boolean value with trick using two negative operators.

```js
function supports_video() {
return !!document.crealeElement('video').canPlayType;
}

```

CanPlayType checks whether format is played and returns to string

Because of its complexity, the video format does not return to Boolean, but rather returns the following string:

- "probably": The browser is almost certain to play this format.
- "maybe": The browser is probably able to play this format.
- " : I am convinced that the browser cannot play this format.

```js
function support_h264_baseline_video() {
if(!supports_video()) { return false; }

var v = document.craeteElement('video');
return v.canPlayType('video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a40.2"');
}

```

An example of a factor for canPlayType is as follows:

- video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a40.2" : H.264 baseline video of MPEC-4 container and AAC LC audio
- video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis: Theora video and bovis audio in the ogg container
- video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis" : WebM -----> not yet detected by Modernizr.

The localStorage property is returned to Boolean whether the localStorage property is defined or not, and the global object Window has the localStorage property.

```js
function supports_local_storage() {
return ('localStorage' in window)
```

The worker attribute is returned to Boolean whether or not the worker attribute is defined, and the worker attribute is in the global object window.

```js
function supports_web_worker() {
return !!window.Worker;
}

```

Whether the applicationCache property is defined or not is returned to Boolean, and the applicationCache property is present in the global object window.

```js
function supports_offline() {
return !!window.applicationCache;
}

```

The geolocation property is returned to Boolean, and the global object navigator has the geolocation property.

```js
function supports_geolocation() {
return !!navigator.geolocation;
}

```

Return to Boolean whether the type is returned to the type specified when the type attribute is read after the input element is specified

```js
function supports_input_type() {
var i = document.createElement('input');
i.setAttribute("type", "TYPE");
return i.type !== "text";
}

```

TYPE = search, number, range, color, tel, url, email, date, month, week, time, datetime, datetime-local (총 13가지)

Return to Boolean whether the input element has a placeholder property

```js
function supports_input_placeholder() {
var i = document.createElement('input');
return 'placeholder' in i;
}

```

Return to Boolean whether the input element has autofocus properties

```js
function supports_input_autofocus() {
var i = document.createElement('input');
return 'autofocus' in i;
}

```

Because it is not supported by Modernizr, there is no choice but to use a DOM method. Return to Boolean whether global object docuemnt has getItems() function

```js
function supports_microdata_api() {
return !!document.getItems;
}

```
