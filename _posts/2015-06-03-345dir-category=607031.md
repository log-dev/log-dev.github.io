### width, height

Specifies the width and height of the element.

```css
p {
width:100px;
height:100px;
}

```

- auto: The browser calculates the width and height. This is the default.
- Length: Specifies the value of the width and height followed by the floating point number followed by the absolute unit designator (cm, mm, in, pt, pc) or relative unit designator (em, ex, px).
- %(percent): Width and height shall be applied in percent.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.width="50px"
object.style.height="50px"

```

The inherit value is not supported below IE7. IE8 requires !DOCTYPE. IE9 to support normally.

### max-height, max-width, min-height, min-width

Specifies the maximum or minimum width/height of the element.

```css
p {
max-width:600px;
min-width:100px;
max-height:300px;
min-height:100px;
}

```

- none : does not specify the maximum or minimum width/height by default.
- Length: Specifies the value at which the absolute unit designator (cm, mm, in, pt, pc) or relative unit designator (em, ex, px) comes after the floating point number.
- %(percent) : Specify the maximum or minimum width/height as the percent value.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.maxWidth="100px"
object.style.minWidth="50px"
object.style.maxHeight="100px"
object.style.minHeight="50px"

```

The inherit value is not supported below IE7. IE8 requires !DOCTYPE. IE9 to support normally.

IE6 and lower versions use nuclei because they do not support the max-width, min-width, max-height, and min-height properties.

```css
div {
width: 200px;
min-height: 250px;
_height: 250px;
}

```
