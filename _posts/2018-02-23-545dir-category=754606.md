### running the Linux tool from a Windows command prompt

It runs the Linux binary at a Windows command prompt (CMD or PowerShell) using the `wsl.exe command`. The binary is called as follows.

- Use the same working directory as the current CMD or PowerShell prompt
- running as WSL default user
- It has the same Windows administrative privileges as the calling process and terminal.

For example

```undefined
C:\temp> wsl ls -la
<- contents of C:\temp ->
```

In Linux commands, `wsl.exe` is treated like a command running in WSL (such as sudo, piping, and redirection of files).

For example

```undefined
C:\temp> wsl sudo apt-get update
[sudo] password for username:
Hit:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial InRelease
Get:2 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu xenial-security InRelease [94.5 kB]
```

Example of a mix of WSL and Windows commands

```undefined
C:\temp> wsl ls -la | findstr "foo"
-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 Sep 27 14:26 foo.bat

C:\temp> dir | wsl grep foo
09/27/2016 02:26 PM 14 foo.bat

C:\temp> wsl ls -la > out.txt

```

Commands delivered to `wsl.exe` are delivered to the WSL process without modification. The file path must be specified in WSL format. For example

```undefined
C:\temp> wsl ls -la /proc/cpuinfo
-r--r--r-- 1 root root 0 Sep 28 11:28 /proc/cpuinfo

C:\temp> wsl ls -la "/mnt/c/Program Files"
<- contents of C:\Program Files ->
```

### Running the Windows tool in WSL

WSL은 `[binary name].You can call Windows binaries directly from the WSL command line using exe`. To make it easier to run Windows executables, the Windows path is included in Linux`s `$PATH`.

Applications running this way have the following properties:

- Keep the working directory as a WSL command prompt (exceptions are described below).
- Has the same privileges as the WSL process
- running as an active Windows user
- It appears in the Windows Task Manager as if you ran it directly from a CMD prompt.

```bash
$ notepad.exe
```

Windows executable files running on WSL are treated similarly to the raw Linux executable (pipping, redirecting, and background operations can be performed as expected). Take an example of a pipe.

```bash
$ ipconfig.exe | grep IPv4 | cut -d: -f2
172.21.240.1
10.159.21.24
```

If you mix Windows commands and WSL commands,

```bash
$ ls -la | findstr.exe foo.txt

$ cmd.exe /c dir
<- contents of C:\ ->
```

Windows binaries must contain file extensions, match file case, and be executable. Non-executable file with batch script. CMD default commands such as `dir` are `cmd`.It can be run with the exe/C` command.

```bash
$ cmd.exe /C dir
<- contents of C:\ ->

$ PING.EXE www.microsoft.com

Reply from 2600:1409:a:5a2::747: time=2ms
```

Parameters are passed to unmodified Windows binaries. For example, the following command opens `C:\temp\foo.txt` in `notepad.exe`.

```bash
$ notepad.exe "C:\temp\foo.txt"
$ notepad.exe C:\\temp\\foo.txt
```

Modifying files in VoIF (files not in /mnt/<x>) with Windows applications is not supported in WSL.

By default, WSL attempts to keep the working directory of the Windows binary as the current WSL directory, but returns to the instance-generated directory if the working directory is VoIFs. For example, `wsl.exe` originally starts with `C:\temp` and the current WSL directory changes to the user`s home. When `notepad.exe` is called from the user`s home directory, WSL automatically reverts `C:\temp` to the notepad.exe working directory.

```bash
C:\temp> wsl
/mnt/c/temp/$ cd ~
~$ notepad.exe foo.txt
~$ ls | grep foo.txt
~$ exit

exit
C:\temp>dir | findstr foo.txt
09/27/2016 02:15 PM 14 foo.txt
```

### Sharing Environment Variables between Windows and WSL

Available on Windows Insider build 17063 and later

In 17063 and earlier versions, only Windows environment variables accessible by WSL could start the Win32 executable under WSL.

Starting from 17063 version, WSL and Windows share `WSLENV`, a special environment variable created to connect Windows and Linux distributions running on WSL.

- Shared, it exists in both Windows and WSL environments.
- A list of environmental variables to be shared between Windows and WSL.
- Environment variables can be formatted to work well on Windows and WSL.

`WSLENV` has four flags that affect how environmental variables are converted.

- `/p` : Transforms the path between WSL/Linux style paths and Win32 paths.
- `/l` : indicates that the environment variable is a path list.
- `/u` : indicates that environment variables should be included only when WSL is run on Win32.
- `/w` : This environment variable indicates that it should be included only when Win32 is run on WSL.

Flags can be combined if necessary.

### Disable Interoperability

Users can disable the ability to run Windows binaries for a single WSL session by executing the following command with root:

```bash
$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop
```

To re-enable Windows binaries, you can exit all WSL sessions and re-run bash.exe or run the following command as root:

```bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/WSLInterop
```

When interoperability is disabled, it is not maintained between WSL sessions (interoperability is re-enabled when a new session is started).

If the version you use is the Creators Update and Anniversary Update version, there may be some parts that work differently than those described above. Check for Creators Update and Anniversary Update.
