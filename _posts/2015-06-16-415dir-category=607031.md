While writing web documents, I often struggle to put elements in the right place. Let me introduce you to the general information about this.

### Introduction to Batch Models

The CSS batch model used for the placement of elements is static, absolute, fixed, relative, float, and relative float batch. This batch model is related to six box models, but is not corresponding or the same concept.

- Static batch models: used for the layout of inline, inline blocks, blocks, and table boxes.
- Absolute position model, fixed position model: used for absolute position box placement, any element can be an absolute position box.
- Float Placement Model: Used for the layout of float boxes, any element can be an absolute position box.
- Relative Position Model: Used for relative positions of all boxes except absolute position boxes.
- Relative float placement model: used for the relative position of the float box.

- Position: static : The placement applied to the element is released and displayed according to the original flow. static is the default value for the position property.
- Position: Relative: An element is placed away from its original position in the original flow.
- Position: Absolute: The element is placed in its original position in the original flow or away from the reference element.
- Position: fixed: Elements are placed away from the browser window.
- left, top, bottom, right: Location attributes allow placement away from the reference position.
- z-index: Used to change the order in which elements are placed on a particular layer. The larger the number, the higher the position.

Fixed deployments are not supported in IE6 and are supported in IE7 and later versions.

If there is no batch element above the batch element, the body element is the reference element. This is because placement is applied as a basis for body elements. The main purpose of aligning a batch element with a reference element is to create a layout group, and when a batch is assigned to that layout group, all the offspring within it are moved at once, whether it is a batch element or not.

To make batch parent element, `position: relative` is designated that does not deviate from the original flow. This allows us to create a layout that links the original position with the absolute position.

To specify the order in which the elements are stacked, use the z-index property of the CSS.

- Static elements are expressed in the order in which they are written.
- Batch elements are stacked from bottom to top in order of the elements with the smallest z-index attribute values, regardless of the order in which they are written in the document. When a negative value is specified in the z-index property of a batch element, the batch element is displayed after a static element and a float element that does not specify a batch.

Specifying z-index values on an element creates a local, self-contained stack context, and all descendant elements (static/float/batch) are rendered within that stack context.

- Specifying a value of `z-index: auto` or specifying a z-index property on an element that does not specify a batch property does not form a stack context.
- Stec context is created by specifying numerical values such as `z-index: 0`, `z-index: -1`, and `z-index:9999`.

Each stack context is bound together by elements and content, so that parent or sibling elements cannot fit in the layer between child and child elements. Each stack context with limited influence is set to zero in the inner stack layer, so the offspring elements are stacked relative to the zero layer, which is very important.

The value specified in z-index is not a hierarchy based on the entire document. It is placed in a relative layer relative to the reference element that specifies a figure in the z-index property. The html element, the root element of a document, forms the root stack context.

Stack contexts are displayed in layers from bottom to top (i.e., from the back of the screen to the front) in the following order:

- Background color, image, border of stack context element
- The descendant element that specifies a negative z-index value and a batch.
- Progenitor Block Element without Batch specified
- Progenitor Float Element Not Specifying
- Inline elements of offspring that do not specify a batch
- The descendant element that specifies the z-index:auto or z-index:0 and the batch specified.
- The descendant element that specifies a positive z-index value and a batch.

Since the batch elements that specify numerical z-index values form separate local stack contexts, the 2,6 and 7 elements render their respective own stack contexts.

If the element is not positioned, the block and the block do not overlap. When static block elements overlap, the background of the two elements overlap, but the inline content within them does not overlap. It is understandable to think that inline elements are not in the block but on the block.

The elements specified in the layout are a mass of content, so it is impossible for the external elements to overlap the static offspring elements, inline content, and background within it.

### Features by Placement Element

Specify `position: static` to place the element in its original position. Since this value is the default, the element is automatically rendered to its original location. Block elements are stacked vertically and inline elements are stacked horizontally within the block elements.

The width/height, padding, border, and margin of the static element determine the starting position of the element behind it.

To render an element as an absolute position box, specify `position: absolute` and to specify the size, specify the width property and the height property. To place reference elements rather than parent elements, specify a percentage in width and height. To place an element, a parent element must be assigned either `position: relative`, `absolute`, or `position: fiexd`. If a placement is not specified for either parent element, the browser recognizes the body element as a reference element.

- Absolute elements can be precisely positioned relative to reference elements, and can be sized, automatically reduced, and automatically enlarged.
- An absolute element is rendered as an absolute position box on the layer above its original position, similar to a block box.
- Unlike float elements, absolute elements do not follow the flow.
- The location of an element shall never be zeroed or subjected to the location of another element or content. This may lead to problems where absolute elements overlap with other elements or contents.
- When all child elements are assigned to an absolute position, the height of the parent element without the height attribute is zero because there is no content inside the parent element, away from its original position.
- Layouts using absolute locations are not properly resized on screens that are too large or too small for design or on devices that use fonts.

IE6 presents the auto-expanding absolute element as auto-reduction. In addition, versions of IE7 and below are not possible to centralize the absolute elements.

`position: fixed` is specified to replace element with fixed batch element. The fixed layout has the same absolute location and principle, but the element is placed based on the browser window, and even if the browser window is scrolled, the element remains intact.

- The fixed element can precisely set the position relative to the browser window.
- Because it does not scroll, it is useful for displaying controls such as menus, toolbars, and buttons in a fixed position.

IE6 and earlier renders the fixed batch element as an absolute element. IE7 and above properly support fixed elements.

To adjust the stack order within the original flow, specify the relative position by specifying `position: relative`. To set the stack order relative to other batch elements, specify the z-index property.

- The relative elements remain unchanged from the original flow and are placed unshapely. For example, if an inline element occupies multiple lines with an automatic line change, this unusual layout remains the same when it is designated as a relative position. This is in contrast to the absolute position. When designated as an absolute position, the inline element changes to an absolute position box and the flow of the content changes to an absolute block box, which eventually changes the layout.

Due to IE7 and earlier versions of hasLayout implementation, relative position inline elements within a batch block element do not stack in front of the screen than elements outside that block element. These errors prevent IE7 from displaying relative position inline span elements in front of the screen rather than absolute position p elements, as illustrated in the figure. Because the p element has layout properties, the inline span element is literally contained within the p element. Other browsers do not have this problem, and IE does not have this problem unless it has layout properties, such as when the parent block element is a static block element. This issue has been addressed in IE8 version.

To release the element from its original flow and place it in front of the screen in the padding area of the parent element or in front of the screen at the right edge, specify either `float: left` or `float: right`. Specify `float: none` to release the float rules specified in the element.

- The float element exists in its own layer at the front of the screen rather than in the background of the block element and is displayed side by side with the inline content of the original flow.
- The float element does not affect the position of the block box, but only the position of the inline content.
- Float elements affect the position of other float elements, they can be displayed side by side on the left or right side of other elements, or pushed down under other float elements or inline content.
- When you specify a vertical or horizontal margin for a float element, it is displayed at a location away from the parent element or other float element.
- Floating elements do not overlap with other float elements or content, but may overlap if margin is specified as negative.

To designate float elements as relative positions, specify `position: relative`. The relative position float element is rendered within the layer that specifies the batch, so the z-index attribute allows the stack to be ordered relative to the float element or other batch element. Relative positional float elements are assigned batch properties, so absolute offspring elements can be placed based on that element.

- The relative float layout specifies the margin property, allowing the positioning of inline content relative to the float element. Then, to set the position of the float element without affecting the position of the inline content, we specify the left and top properties. This method allows the placement of float elements with great flexibility.
- Without the use of relative float placement, it is impossible to establish a stack order of float elements or other batch elements unless the writing sequence is changed within the document.

The only batch properties available for float elements are position:relative and position:static. Specifying a position:absolute or position:fixed for a float element makes the results uncertain because it handles different browsers.
