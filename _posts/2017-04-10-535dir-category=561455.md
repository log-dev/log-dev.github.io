The PC industry is making a lot of noise with AMD`s launch of RYZEN. AMD, which had been shunned by the public for its performance less than Intel for a while, has launched a counterattack with its cost-effectiveness and performance. This has led to a number of reviews on performance testing and overclocking efficiency through benchmarks for the Rizen 7 product lines that were first released in several hardware forums.

I was also considering replacing my computer, so while I was gathering information related to Rizen, I was having a hard time judging because of the information that caused confusion. I think many people are in a similar position, so I gather related information.

### Introducing AMD RYZEN

Rizen is produced under the Zen architecture of the 14 nm (nano) process, and its code name is Summit Ridge. The brand name is Ryzen, and the corresponding product name is also written as AMD Ryzen 71700 (Summit Ridge).

Summit Ridge will be produced on desktop CPUs and Raven Ridge will be released on APU (CPU+GPU) in the second half of 2017. In other words, the current and scheduled-to-be-released Rizen product lines must have a separate graphics card, which can be compared to the current way Intel releases only the embedded graphics in its CPU, making it an option for people using external graphics.

All Rizen products are overclockable (Intel`s products are overclockable only with K versions). In addition, the X-version family of Rizen, which includes a feature called Extended Frequency Range (XFR), can be expected to improve performance by 100Mhz by operating an auto-overclock that increases the boost clock if CPU temperature and power are affordable. Although this feature is known to work only on the X family, it is now known that products other than the X family can expect to improve 50Mhz performance.

AMD officially announced its next-generation CPU RYZEN based on the "ZEN" microarchitecture on February 23, 2017, and official sales of RYZEN 7 began on March 2, about 10 days later.

In summary, the contents of the video are as follows.

- The brand name is RYZEN, and the RYZEN 7 line-up is 1800X, 1700X and 1700, all of which are 8 cores and 16 threads.
Brand Name Core (Thread) Clock/Booster Clock L2 Cache L3 Cache TDP Price
Ryzen 7 1800X 8(16) 3.6GHz/4.0GHz 4MB 16MB 95W $499
Ryzen 7 1700X 8(16) 3.4GHz/3.8GHz 4MB 16MB 95W $399
Ryzen 7 1700 8(16) 3.0GHz/3.7GHz 4MB 16MB 65W $329
- As a result of the past four years` efforts, it has improved 52% beyond its target of 40% improvement in IPC.
- Comparison of powerful flagship processors 1800X and Intel i76900K
- 1700X vs Intel i7 6800K for gamers and content creators
- Comparison of 1700 and i77700K with low cost-effectiveness and low power consumption

Compared to its competitor Intel, the Rizen products have excellent cost-effectiveness. It is expected that Samsung Electronics will continue this trend as well as products that will be released afterwards.

> I've set a single goal for Rizen.
I wanted to shake up the PC market.
I wanted to provide innovation, choice, and performance to as many people as possible.
So we've priced it to deliver high-performance computing to tens or hundreds of times more people.
To provide everyone with more cores and more threads.

### Risen Cooler

Rizen has different coolers that can be provided or purchased depending on the product line. The X family does not offer a basic cooler, and a multi-pack combination is available for purchase.

### Risen Overclock

The entire Rizen family supports overclocking. It also offers a utility called Rizen Master to easily support overclocking on Windows. CPU core-related adjustments are applied immediately without rebooting, and memory voltage and timing adjustments require reboot.

- For 1700 products, 3.7 to 3.8GHz national over without voltage regulation
- For the 1800X and 1700X, 4GHz overclocking is the majority, and more overclocking is likely to require know-how.
- Regarding overclock, we hope to improve to AMD or bios patch.

### Rizen Benchmark

Various hardware forums and individuals have comparative benchmarks with the Rizen 7 family and Intel`s i7 family.

- In almost all tasks using multithread (Internet broadcasting, graphics work, encoding, computation, rendering, etc.), the Rizen family has an advantage or comparison with multiple cores and threads.
- The overall performance of the game is slightly lower than that of the Intel comparators, and the width may increase depending on the type of game.
- Unlike in the past, which is far behind in terms of electricity consumption, it is showing better electricity consumption at the same level.

### Rizen Optimization

Along with the launch of Reizen, the lack of support from each third-party company is controversial. Obviously, it shows how AMD has been treated in the meantime.

The main boards that support Rizen are the main boards of the AM4 chipset. Each mainboard manufacturer is currently updating bios, with short and frequent patches taking place. It is regrettable that it was not distributed in a complete form before its release. In some cases, each manufacturer seems to have different problems, such as 25% improvement in performance after bios patch.

There are some people who dismiss AMD CPU as a problem, and in fact, this is a support issue for third-party companies, so I think we should look at it separately. It may also prove that AMD`s influence was so insignificant.

Additionally, it is necessary to download and install chipset drivers from AMD`s official website to ensure stable system operation.

There were many benches that the game performance of the Rizen product line was insufficient compared to that of Intel. It was a curious part of the game`s poor performance, but it was tentatively concluded that AMD CPUs did not, even though existing game manufacturers were optimized for Intel CPUs. Major game makers are expected to improve this through patches and updates in the future, given that beta versions are currently preparing AMD CPU-based patches. However, games that have not been steadily patched and updated since the release of the game are unlikely to improve.

When the game meets AMD Rizen optimization, up to 30% improvement in performance?
Verification Review: Improving AMD Rizen CPU Performance in Optimized Games

The recommended memory operating speed for the Rizen system on the AMD side is DDR4 2666 MHz (clock 2666 MHz, voltage 1.3 V, timing 16-16-16-16-36 recommended memory). This is because internal test results also showed that bottlenecks disappear from 2666MHz. Memory speed is also highly affected by the bios on the main board, and the maximum memory speed supported varies depending on the main board, so you should take a closer look at it. In contrast to the lack of performance improvement in high-clock memory in existing systems, the use of high-clock memory increases noticeably, so let`s keep that in mind.

Currently, the actual risen memory speed is known to be around 3200 MHz when adjusting the bus speed, which AMD will distribute updates to mainboard partners in May, which will further improve the speed. Through this, companies will be able to support faster speeds than current DDR4 3200 RAM regardless of what products customers choose.

XMP, one of the ram-over clock features used by Intel`s mainboard, is not officially supported by AMD`s mainboard; MSI has released a similar technology, the A-XMP feature, to distribute bios. In other words, existing XMP-enabled memory can be used depending on the bios of the mainboard manufacturer. In addition, AMP memory is being sold overseas, and it will soon be released in Korea, and if XMP memory is already purchased, mainboard manufacturers should check if it is compatible.

MSI announce auto DDR4 OC support on AMD Ryzen platform with A-XMP feature

Due to core parking in Windows 10, there is a case that all threads do not have equal work distribution. This can be solved by changing from Windows` power options to high performance.

It is recommended to turn off the high-precision event timer "HPET" in the bios menu or in Windows. If HPET is stopped, it can experience 5-8% improvement in game frame rate.

In some cases, HPET settings are present in the mainboard bios menu, and if not, it can be manually turned off using the command `bcdedit/set use platform clock false` at the command prompt (CMD) on Windows.

### a general review

- Existing AMD products have been shunned for their high heat, power consumption, and poor per-clock efficiency, while Reizen has improved most of the past dirt.
- As it is said to be a growing CPU, not a complete CPU, it is regrettable that it is not fully compatible at the time of release, and that it can lead to performance improvement through various patches and optimizations. However, it should be acknowledged that the performance has been verified even in systems prior to optimization and the cost-effectiveness is excellent.
- The Rizen 7 offers people who have dreamed of an extreme-class PC a chance to organize it at a lower price than Intel, and takes the lead in the universalization of 8-core and 16-trash.
- Active optimization is expected from game companies to resolve issues of game performance.
- It must be beneficial for consumers if AMD and Intel compete for performance and price, but before that, it should be noted that those armed with vendors, used price defense, and fan sentiment often blur consumer judgment. While collecting the data, AMD and Intel`s fanboys exaggerated or underestimated the material.
