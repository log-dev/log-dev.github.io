When creating a layout using float, there is a problem that the parent element does not reflect the size of the child element. The element with float is excluded from the flow of the document and floats like a floating layer, and other non-float block elements float on different floors, preventing the height of the child from being passed on to the parents.

### FLOAT Layout

For example, the basic form of float layout.

The container that surrounds the whole above does not reflect the height of the child elements, but only shows the height of its own.

The layout originally intended below shows that the parent container properly reflects the child elements.

The basic structure is as follows.

```html
<style>
.pull-left { float: left }
.pull-right { float: right }
</style>

<div class="container">
<div>header</div>
<div class="pull-left">nav</div>
<div class="pull-right">content</div>
</div>

```

We are explaining below how to solve this problem, and make sure to use it according to your situation.

```css
.container { float: left }

```

Float elements also give the parent element a float attribute because they match each other. However, this method eventually results in all blocks of the current document being given unnecessary float attributes. Because all blocks must be floating on the same floor to avoid invading each other`s territory. This method is never recommended, as this box will overlap with the other box that is floated if even one block has not been floated.

```css
.container { overflow: hidden }

```

Change the overflow property. All elements have the default value of the overflow property, which is visible. You can change this value to a value other than visible. Other values include auto, scroll, and hidden. This is not the safest method because scrolling or hiding occurs when a child`s block overflows the parent block. The outer layer of the parent`s box of child elements.This method will never be available if layer {position:absolute}` is needed. This is also not a recommended method because no one can guarantee that such a layer will never happen in the future.

```css
.clear { clear: both }

```

The clear property is a property that breaks the flow of a floated element and processes lines from the floated element itself. At the bottom of the float element, one contentless block "<div class="clear"></div>" is added, and only after adding the clear property is added, the height of the floated child elements is reflected in the parent, and the value of the clear property is left, right, and bot. It is also not a recommended method because it requires adding meaningless empty elements.

```css
.container:after { content:""; clear:both; display:block; }

```

A virtual selector is a technique for controlling elements that do not exist in practice or dynamic elements that occur only in special circumstances with CSS commands. Virtual selectors can again be distinguished as `virtual class selectors` and `virtual element selectors`, such as virtual class selectors (:link, :visited, :over, :active, :focus, :first-child) can be used as if they were classed dynamically on a particular element. A virtual element selector (also known as :first-line, :first-letter, :before, :after) is a technique that uses elements that do not really exist as if they exist. The virtual element selector `:after` can use the attribute content to output the value "*" of the content property to the screen just before the .container block ends. Given the "clear:both" attribute to these generated elements, the height of the child can be communicated to parents, which is the most ideal method because there are no empty elements in HTML code.

IE 6–7 browsers do not support virtual element selectors.

```css
.container { *zoom: 1; }

```

IE 6–7 browsers do not support virtual element selectors:after, but CSShack allows the height of the child to be communicated to parents. The `zoom:1` property is an extension property dedicated to IE, and its original purpose is to freely `zoom in/zoom out` web documents in an IE browser. Given this property, the element has a property called hasLayout that exists only in IE browsers, which acts as a trigger for solving float problems in IE browsers and does not affect other browsers. The reason for putting `*` in front of the zoom property is `hack` that does not exist at this time, but makes it ignore this code even if an attribute with the same name as the zoom appears as a standard or as a CSS extension property in another web browser. If you put `*` before an attribute without spaces, the attribute will only work in IE 6~7 browsers.

: Using After and solving the problems in IE6–7 are as follows.

```css
.container { *zoom: 1; }
.container:after { content: ""; clear: both; display: block; }

```

### Bootstrap clearfix

The clearfix provided by bootstrap works without strain on IE8 and later. Since IE6–7 has not been considered recently, it is not bad to use this method and is no different from the code introduced above.

```css
.clearfix:before,.clearfix:after { content: " "; display: table; }
.clearfix:after { clear:both; }

```

The parent element that protects the float child.Give `clearfix`.
