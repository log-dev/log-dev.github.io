You can use the newly added property called placeholder to give hints to the input element. IE9 and below are not working properly, so we look at some alternative options to overcome them. This is the first one.

### HTML5 Placeholder jQuery Plugin 소개

It is a plug-in created with jQuery to implement placeholder in IE9 and earlier versions.

### HTML5 Placeholder jQuery Plugin 사용법

Create a form control to use in HTML.

```html
<input type="text" name="name" placeholder="e.g. John Doe" />
<input type="password" name="password" placeholder="e.g. h4x0rpr00fz" />
<textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message goes here"></textarea>

```

Insert the jQuery library and HTML5 Placeholder jQuery Plugin.

```html
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.placeholder.js"></script>

```

It applies HTML5 Placeholder jQuery Plugin.

```html
<script>
$(function() {
$('input, textarea').placeholder();
});
</script>

```

Apply CSS to the Placeholder property. This plug-in automatically adds a class of `class="placeholder" to a tag with a placeholder property, so you can apply CSS. However, only browsers that do not officially support the placeholder property such as IE.

```css
.placeholder { color: #aaa; }

```

### HTML5 Placeholder jQuery Plugin 주의사항

- It supports jQuery 1.6+. The older version operating in jQuery 1.4.2+ shall use v1.8.7.
- It works with all advanced browsers, including IE6.
- If the browser automatically checks and supports HTML5`s placeholder properties for input and textarea elements by default, the plug-in does not perform any action. If only the input element supports this, the plug-in works independently of the textarea element (Safari 4, Opera 11.00, and posibly other browsers).
- It caches the results of two functional tests: `jQuery.fn.placeholder.input` and `jQuery.fn.placeholder.textarea`. For example, if the input element provides the placeholder property by default, `jQuery.fn.placeholder.input` is true. After loading the plug-in, these properties can be reused in their own code.
- Write the ID so that it does not overlap, even if the browser needs an extra input element for the fake placeholder attribute for the password control element. (Makes sure it never causes duplicate IDs in your DOM, even in browsers that need an extra input element to fake @placeholder for password inputs. This means you can safely do stuff like:)
HTML
`<label for="bar">Example label</label>
<input type="password" placeholder="foo" id="bar">
`
The label element will always point to the input element and all CSS styles will be styled based on the ID.

In the current native IE8, the password field is automatically modified using the fake password. However, this results in an error related to the validate plugin. The validate plug-ins are incompatible with the fake password.
