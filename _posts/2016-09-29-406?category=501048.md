Learn Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the most important feature of object-oriented programming features.

Learn the concept of polymorphism and learn how to use polymorphism in JavaScript.

### What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism is a feature that separates certain functions into declaration (design) and implementation (action) parts, and then makes implementation parts available in a variety of ways.

The declaration part is also known as the interface.

In more detail, the declaration part is a kind of protocol document that is empty with no implementation code at all and full of promises (conventions) to keep.

Developers simply need to implement the implementation code to address the issue in accordance with the declaration part.

In other words, the declaration part and the implementation part form a polymorphic relationship of 1: N.

To help you understand, let`s take an example of polymorphism.

Multi-tabs and power cables

Examples of polymorphisms are easily found in reality.

Think about the multi-tap that is used the most around you.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/214F3C3B57512E1820)

If you approach a multi-tap with a polymorphic concept, the declaration part is the part with two holes.

The implementation part is a power cable that connects to a multi-tap.

To connect to this multi-tap, the power cable (e.g. monitor power cable) must have two bouncing connections and must never have one or three bouncing parts.

And the protruding part must not be a square, but must be round.

Note that when you make the declaration part real code, the basic function of object-oriented programming is the interface and abstract classes are used, and the implementation part is the normal class and the abstract class.

We will deal with this later.

USB and USB devices

Polymorphism can also be found on your favorite USB device.

All USB devices are tailored to USB specifications. Also, the computer that connects and uses USB is made according to the USB standard.

Any device that is made according to the USB specification can be connected and used.

Even USB products that haven`t been released yet.

The USB specification corresponds to the interface, which is the design part, and the USB devices are responsible for the implementation part.

### Relationship between polymorphism and data type

This time, we will learn about the relationship between polymorphism and data type.

Data types are not important in JavaScript, but data types are very important in general programming.

Meaning of data types in general object-oriented programming

First, JavaScript does not create a data type when declaring a variable, but in general programming, you should create a data type in advance to store in most variables.

And this same concept is used in functions and methods.

If you create a function and declare it as a string type in the parameter, you must call the method with the string data value; if you do it with a different value, an error will occur.

In general programming, data types are used as a kind of mandatory protocol.

In general object-oriented programming, data types have the following rules:

- When declaring variables and parameters, only instances of classes that implement a particular interface can be saved or passed to parameter values if they are specific interface types.
- When declaring variables and parameters, only instances of a particular class or child class that inherits a particular class can be saved or passed to parameter values if they are of a particular class type.

### Polymorphism in JavaScript

Let`s take a quick look at how JavaScript implements polymorphism.

First, if you look at the syntax for polymorphism in general object-oriented programming, it is divided into declaration and implementation parts and is used as follows:

- Polymorphism Declaration Part: Interface and Abstract class
- Polymorphism Implementation Part: Class

Whether or not JavaScript supports polymorphism in JavaScript

JavaScript does not support syntax related to polymorphism, such as interface, abstract class, and strict data type checking.

That`s why JavaScript creates code in a polymorphic way, assuming that it supports polymorphism.

It doesn`t just provide grammar, but if you use polymorphism to create code, you will be able to do better programming.

When you apply the concept of polymorphism in JavaScript, you typically have the following structure:

```js
'// JavaScript has no declaration part.
// Just think about the declaration part and write it.

// classes that use the implementation part using synthesis
functional image alignment (declaration part) {// assume and use this part as a declaration part.
the declaration partfunction1();
the declaration partfunction2();
}

/**
* -----------------------------------------------------
* Implementation part
* Implementation is also implemented in accordance with the declaration part, assuming that there is a declaration part.
* -----------------------------------------------------
*/
// First batch of implementation subclasses
function function function1() {
// Implementation Code
}
function function function1() {
// Implementation Code
}

// Second batch of implementation subclasses
function function function2() {
// Implementation Code
}
function function function2() {
// Implementation Code
}

// Third batch of implementation subclasses
function function function3() {
// Implementation Code
}
function function function3() {
// Implementation Code
}
```

### Create a Simple Gallery with Polymorphism

Take some time to verify the polymorphism you have identified above with a simple example.

To check the advantages of polymorphism, we will proceed step by step with cases where polymorphism is not applied and polymorphism is applied.

Simple Gallery Requirements

- When a button is pressed, it tries to implement an image alignment function that fits the button.
- Four buttons require horizontal alignment, vertical alignment, random alignment, and Go board alignment functions.

The default markup and style are as follows:

```undefined
<div class="btn-gruop">
<button id="btnHorizontal">가로정렬</button>
<button id="btnVertical">세로정렬</button>

<button id="btnRandom">랜덤정렬</button>
<button id="btnGrid">Sort the bank</button>
</div>

<div class="image-container" id="container1">
<img src="src/images/1.jpg">
<img src="src/images/2.jpg">
<img src="src/images/3.jpg">
<img src="src/images/4.jpg">
<img src="src/images/5.jpg">
<img src="src/images/6.jpg">
<img src="src/images/7.jpg">
<img src="src/images/8.jpg">
</div>
```

```css
.btn-gruop {
margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.btn-gruop button {
background-color: #222;
color: #fff;
border-radius: 4px;
border: 1px solid #ccc;
line-height: 1;
padding: 5px 10px;
}

div.image-container {
position: relative;
border: 1px solid #000;
}

div.image-container img {
position: absolute;
left: 0;
top: 0;
width: 120px;
}
```

The following code is the default function for image horizontal alignment:

```js
$(function(){

var gallery = new Gallery('#container1 img')
var $btnHorizn = $('#btnHorizontal');

$btnHorizn.on('click', function () {
gallery.show();
});

});

function Gallery(selector) {
this.$images = null;
this.init(selector)
}

Gallery.prototype.init = function (selector) {
this.$images = $(selector);
};

// Image Alignment Basic Features
Gallery.prototype.show = function () {
// Get the number of images
var length = this.$images.length;

for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
var $img = this.$images.eq(i);
var x = i * 150;

$img.css({
left : x
})
}
};
```

Code that created and implemented each of the four sorting functions required above without polymorphism.

```js
$(function(){

var gallery = new Gallery('#container1 img');
var $btnHorizn = $('#btnHorizontal'),
$btnRandom = $('#btnRandom'),
$btnVertical = $('#btnVertical'),
$btnGrid = $('#btnGrid');


$btnHorizn.on('click', function () {
gallery.show('horizontal');
});
$btnVertical.on('click', function () {
gallery.show('vertical');
});
$btnRandom.on('click', function () {
gallery.show('random');
});
$btnGrid.on('click', function () {
gallery.show('grid');
});

});

function Gallery(selector) {
this.$images = null;
this.init(selector)
}

Gallery.prototype.init = function (selector) {
this.$images = $(selector);
};

// Process Image Alignment Direction
Gallery.prototype.show = function (type) {

switch (type) {
case 'horizontal' :
this.horizontal();
break;
case 'vertical' :
this.vertical();
break;
case 'random' :
this.random();
break;
case 'grid' :
this.grid();
break;
default :
this.horizontal();
}

};

// Handle image horizontal alignment
Gallery.prototype.horizontal = function () {
// Get the number of images
var length = this.$images.length;

for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
var $img = this.$images.eq(i);
var x = i * 150;

$img.css({
left : x
})
}

};

// Process Image Alignment
Gallery.prototype.vertical = function () {
// Get the number of images
var length = this.$images.length;

// Arranging images
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
var $img = this.$images.eq(i);
var y = i * 150;

$img.css({
left: 0,
top : y
})
}
};

// Process Image Random Alignment
Gallery.prototype.random = function () {
// Get the number of images
var length = this.$images.length;

// Arranging images
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
var $img = this.$images.eq(i);
var x = 200 * Math.random();
var y = 200 * Math.random();

$img.css({
left : x
top : y
})
}
};

// Handle Image Go Plate Alignment
Gallery.prototype.grid = function () {
// Get the number of images
var length = this.$images.length,
count = 3;

// Arranging images
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
var $img = this.$images.eq(i);
var x = (i % count) * 150;
var y = parseInt(i / count) * 150;

$img.css({
left : x
top : y
})
}
}
```

If you take a closer look at the code above, all four image alignment features are implemented inside the Gallery constructor (class).

This has the following problems:

There are many unused codes.

- Since all four image sorting functions are implemented in the Gallery class, from portrait to landscape to random image sorting, selecting one feature will disable the three features and make them unnecessary code.

Code reuse is poor.

- The image alignment function is implemented inside the gallery, so if you want to use the image alignment function independently, you cannot use it. You must create an instance of the Gallery class before you can use the sort feature you want.

It is difficult to maintain.

- If you need to add a new image alignment feature in addition to the four alignment features, you need to add it to the Gallery class and implement it, which makes it increasingly difficult to maintain.

Code with Polymorphism

For your information, typically code before applying polymorphism is a typical case in which a code that uses a switch to handle multiple conditions can be changed to polymorphism.

Take the above code and divide it into 5 steps for polymorphism application.

- Step 01 : Create Polymorphic Declaration Part
- Step 02 : Create Polymorphic Implementation Part (Sorting Function Implementation)
- Step 03: Aligning alignment functions using polymorphism and synthesis
- Step 04 : Call Alignment Function
- Step 05 : To verify that sorting functionality is available independently:
- Step 06 : Cleanup

Step 01 : Create Polymorphic Declaration Part

The first task of creating polymorphism is to select features that must be implemented in common with the implementation part and make it a declaration part.

For the Image Alignment Gallery now, it would be great if you could make the sorting function a declaration part.

```js
function align($images) {
// implement alignment here
}
```

To sum up, the declaration part is a must-have promise as we have seen before, and the implementation part must define and implement the method with the same number of parameters and name of the method defined in the declaration part.

In addition, JavaScript does not provide a grammar that defines the declaration part of polymorphism, so let`s assume that the declaration part was created and proceed.

In other words, the above code does not exist in the actual code because it is carried out under the assumption that it was actually created.

Step 02 : Create Polymorphic Implementation Part

This is the step to implement the code according to the declaration part.

After creating four sort feature classes, as shown in the code below, add the same method as the method created in the declaration part to implement the sort feature.

You don`t have to create multiple instances, you just need to create one, so let`s try to create a class using a literal rather than a prototype method.

```js
// Horizontal Alignment Function
var horizontal = {
align : function ($images) {
// Get the number of images
var length = $images.length;

// Arranging images
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
var $img = $images.eq(i);

var x = i * 150;
$img.css({
left : x
top : 0
});
}
}
};

// Vertical Alignment Capability
var vertical = {
align : function ($images) {
// Get the number of images
var length = $images.length;

// Arranging images
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
var $img = $images.eq(i),
y = i * 150;

$img.css({
left: 0,
top : y
})
}
}
};

// Random sorting capability
var random = {
align : function ($images) {
// Get the number of images
var length = $images.length;

// Arranging images
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
var $img = $images.eq(i),
x = 200 * Math.random(),
y = 200 * Math.random();

$img.css({
left : x
top : y
})
}
}
};

// Go board alignment function
var grid = {
align : function ($images) {
// Get the number of images
var length = $images.length,
count = 3;

// Arranging images
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
var $img = $images.eq(i),
x = (i % count) * 150,
y = parseInt(i / count) * 150;

$img.css({
left : x
top : y
})
}
}
}
```

Step 03: Aligning alignment functions using polymorphism and synthesis

Now, to apply polymorphism to the show() method of the Gallery class, we want you to add parameters to receive instances of the class that implemented the sorting function.

```js
Enable `// Image Alignment
Gallery.prototype.show = function (alignable) {
alignable.align(this.$images);
};
```

When the Sort function button is pressed, the sort function selected will be moved to the alignable parameter and used.

This means that you can borrow and use sorting functions using synthesis.

Step 04 : Call Alignment Function

When you click the Sort button, it calls the show() method to the parameter value for an instance of the alignment function (align) that fits the button.

```js
$(function(){

var alignImg = new Gallery('#container1 img');
var $btnHorizn = $('#btnHorizontal'),
$btnRandom = $('#btnRandom'),
$btnVertical = $('#btnVertical'),
$btnGrid = $('#btnGrid');


$btnHorizn.on('click', function () {
alignImg.show(horizontal); // forwarding horizontal alignment instances
});
$btnVertical.on('click', function () {
alignImg.show(vertical); // forwarding a vertical alignment instance
});
$btnRandom.on('click', function () {
alignImg.show(random); // forward random sort instance
});
$btnGrid.on('click', function () {
alignImg.show(grid); // Forward Baduk Alignment Instances
});

});
```

Step 05 : To verify that sorting functionality is available independently:

Lastly, I will do a test.

Because the sorting function is not implemented inside the gallery but is externally independent, you will be able to use the random sorting function independently as follows:

```js
$(function(){

var $btnRandom = $('#btnRandom');

$btnRandom.on('click', function () {
// Use only random sorting independently
random.align($('#container1 img'));
});

});
```

Step 06 : Cleanup

Lastly, let`s summarize the code we`ve written so far.

The image alignment feature is not implemented inside the Gallery class, but is implemented as an independent class.

This allows the gallery to be implemented with polymorphism to have the following:

Lightened Code

It`s much lighter because it`s all externally implemented, rather than directly implementing image alignment inside the Gallery class. At the same time, you can simplify code.

Increases code reuse.

Image alignment is implemented independently of each other, allowing you to use image alignment without Gallery assistance.

Easier maintenance

If you need to add a new image alignment feature, you can create a class to match the image alignment feature interface and connect it to the gallery. Without modifying the Gallery class at all.
