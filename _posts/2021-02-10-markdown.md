Do you know about Mark Down?
Have you seen the file with the file extension `.md`?
While developing the web, you probably saw a file named "README.md" once, which was written in a markdown grammar.

It`s very easy to use, and you can organize your documents quickly.
Of course, it is not possible to replace all HTML markups, so use them to write easily and quickly rather than relying too much.
Similar to Markdown, the grammar is more complicated, but there is also the AsciiDoc grammar with the extension `.adoc`. You can create more diverse forms of documentation, but the grammar is more complicated and the support platform is less.

First, learn Markdown grammar that is easy to grammar and supports various platforms.
30 minutes is enough.

# About Mark Down.

## Advantages of Markdown

- Grammar is easy.
- Easy to manage.
- There are various platforms and programs available.

## Markdown's Disadvantages

- There are no standards, so grammar may vary from user to user.
- It does not replace all HTML markups.

## Use of Markdown

You can use it in many places, from notepad to dedicated editors.
The grammar is easy, so you don`t have to use a dedicated editor, but if you want the highlight of the markdown code, I think a dedicated editor would be a good choice.
I usually use Atom.
Alternatively, you can use it anywhere that supports markdown grammar, or you can use it as if you were writing a message from a regular blog or service other than WordPress such as Slack or Trello.
The style (CSS) represented on the screen depends on the setting.
Just like HTML, ignore the visible style and use it as a meaning of each grammar.
