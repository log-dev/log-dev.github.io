By default, the settings are divided into Default and User. This is a method of overwriting the desired setting in the User part, referring to Default, which is the default value for sublime text.

This is the main configuration of sub-lime text. This cannot be modified directly, but it explains what the settings mean.

The desired setting is written and overridden in this part. Below is the contents of my settings.

```js
{
"always_show_minimap_viewport": true,
"bold_folder_labels": true,
"draw_minimap_border": true,
"font_size": 12,
"highlight_line": true,
"ignored_packages":
[
"Vintage"
],
"tab_size": 2,
"translate_tabs_to_spaces": false,
"word_wrap": true,
"draw_white_space": "all"
}

```

The default shortcut settings for sublime text are listed.

This part can be set with the desired shortcut.

The size of characters can be immediately increased or decreased.

- Increase: Shortcut Ctrl + Keypad Plus
- Decrease: Convenience key Ctrl + Keypad Minus

> Ctrl + Mouse Wheel is more convenient.

You can change the themes that are provided by default. Other themes can be installed with plug-ins.

You can change the settings of the plug-ins that you have installed. Similarly, it is divided into Default and User.
