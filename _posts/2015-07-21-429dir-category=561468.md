It`s a story about the foam-related elements that continue. We will deal with the problems and alternatives that we thought about while designing each field in the form sequentially.

### Separating label elements from placeholder properties

The label element is a component of the "for" property and associated fields (input, select, textarea, checkbox, radio). That is, it serves as the title of the input fields, sometimes using this element to replace the interaction.

The placeholder property serves as an example to provide hints to text fields. It is wrong in principle to write this as a substitute for label elements. Furthermore, the placeholder property is not supported by IE9 and earlier, which requires polyfill (alternative method).

Some of the built-in browsers on mobile devices have bugs where changing the height of the text field prevents the placeholder from being aligned vertically.

### Points of significance when designing text fields

If you are considering compatibility with browsers (IE8), you should refrain from using `height` or `line-height` properties when designing fields. In IE8, when the height value is applied to a text field element, there is a problem with the vertical alignment of the letter, which requires a line-height value that is reduced by approximately 3 to 4px from the specified height value to be the vertical center alignment of the letter.

Design with height

While using `padding` properties, it is recommended to use em units so that margins can be flexibly expanded and reduced depending on the size of letters.

```css
input[type="text"],
input[type="password"] {
height: auto; /* initialize height */
line-height: normal; /* line-height 초기화 */
padding: .8em.5em; /* margin setting */
}

```

### Positioning of label elements

By using the label element as a placeholder, the label element is moved to where the placeholder is located, provided that the placeholder property is not used.

The basic structure is as follows.

```html
<div class="textbox">
<label for="ex_input">아이디</label>
<input type="text" id="ex_input">
</div>

```

- Create label elements and input elements
- Set the parent element that surrounds them
- Match the values of the label element`s for property and the id property of the input element so that the label element can interact with the input element (even if the label element is clicked, the input element is focused).

The CSS settings are as follows.

```css
.textbox {position: relative;}

.textbox label {
position: absolute;
top: 1px; /* input As much as the border-top setting of the element */
left: 1px; /* input As much as the border-left setting of the element */
padding: .8em.5em; /* input The padding value of the element */
color: #999;
cursor: text;
}

.textbox input[type="text"],
.textbox input[type="password"] {
width: 100%; /* set the desired width */
height: auto; /* initialize height value */
line-height: normal; /* line-height 초기화 */
padding: .8em.5em; /* Set desired margin, adjust height with upper and lower margin */
font-family: inherit; /* font inheritance */
border: 1px solid #999;
Border-radius: 0; /* Remove iSO Round Edge */
Outline-style: none; /* If you want to remove the effect from focus */
-webkit-appearance: none; /* Remove browser-specific default styling */
-moz-appearance: none;
appearance: none;
}

```

Let`s check if it matches exactly by entering the value directly into the input field.

Make sure the location of the label element is correct on mobile as well. In some cases, `vertical-align: top` may be required for label elements.

JavaScript should be used to hide label elements if the location of label elements and input values is appropriate. I used jQuery for convenience.

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
var placeholderTarget = $('.textbox input[type="text"], .textbox input[type="password"]');

//focus
placeholderTarget.on('focus', function(){
$(this).siblings('label').fadeOut('fast');
});

//Focus out
placeholderTarget.on('focusout', function(){
if($(this).val() == ''){
$(this).siblings('label').fadeIn('fast');
}
});
});

```

Let`s see an example of how it actually works.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="212" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/uzugoer/embed/QbVZyg?height=212&amp;theme-id=17120&amp;slug-hash=QbVZyg&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=uzugoer&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_QbVZyg"></iframe>

In general, the above code alone works well, but in some cases it will require additional code.

For example, membership registration and information modification may occur on a single page. Information modification form, the values entered for membership appear in value by default, and the code written above hides the label element based on focus and focusout events, so additional code to determine and process the value value when loading the page is needed.

```js
placeholderTarget.each(function(){
if(!($(this).val() == '')){
$(this).siblings('label').css('display','none');
}
});

```

For example, if an input field is detected and a pre-populated value is imported or an application is used to paste it. It is doubtful whether it will work correctly in all applications, but it is recommended to use the input event as an alternative. In older IE, problems with bugs and unsupported problems should be addressed using plug-ins.

The input event detection cross-browsing addresses this, and if the plug-in is used, the following code can be added:

```js
placeholderTarget.on('textchange', function(){
$(this).siblings('label').fadeOut('fast');
});

```

> Since the label disappears as soon as the existing focus event is focused, there is an inconvenience that the entered value must be deleted and the focus must be out to double-check what field it was. However, using textchange synthesis events does not disappear until the actual value is entered, so it can give good user experience to people whose memory has declined like I did.

For example, if a value is entered due to the influence of other programs, such as a page containing an address search, there is a limit to capturing the event. The program should be able to intervene and modify the label element to hide it the moment it enters a value in the input field. Some programs support a callback function that allows you to add an action based on when the program is completed, so you should take a good look at it.

```js
new daum.Postcode({
oncomplete: function(data) {
//Create Hide Code
}
});

```

### Design of password fields

Password input fields are also used with the text fields described above. If you were in a position to use the placeholder property, you would have used plug-ins for cross-browsing of older browsers, but form verification might have failed due to plug-ins using fake passwords. If so, the techniques described above could be the solution.

### Design of textarea fields

The textarea element is also not much different from the one described above. However, it is only different that you can use the height value to set the textarea element to the desired size.
