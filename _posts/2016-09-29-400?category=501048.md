Expand Members

Extensions refer to passing all members of a parent object to a child object and adding its own members.

In general object-oriented languages, inheritance is usually used as a method of scaling, and this article introduces a practical and simple method of scaling JavaScript alone.

Provides instructions for implementing inheritance in the following order:

- Prototype member inheritance
- Instance Member Inheritance
- Expand Members

### Implement Prototype Member Inheritance - Prototype

The prototype member inheritance introduced here is a common method used in JavaScript.

Let`s define the Korean inheritance of the person.

The following is the code for the person constructor:

```js
function Person() {
// No instance member definition
}

// Define a prototype member of a person
Person.prototype.species = 'human';
```

Next, let`s define the Korean constructor.

Have Korean define additional members of the nationality prototype.

```js
Definition of Korean
function Korean() {
// No instance member definition
}
// Define prototype members of Korean
Korean.prototype.nationality = 'korea';
```

Now write a code for Korean to inherit the prototype member of Person.

```js
Korean.prototye = new Person();
Korean.prototype.constructor = Korean;
```

The inheritance of a prototype member inherits the Object prototype object by executing the following code internally when defining the Person object:

```js
Person.prototype = new Object();
Person.prototype.constructor = Person
```

The above code is to use the Object instance as a prototype object for Person and add the constructor pointing to the Person constructor as a member of the prototype object that you just added.

When defining a person inheriting an object, JavaScript automatically handles the previous two tasks.

But what we`re trying to do here is to inherit a person and define a different custom child type, not an object.

In this case, the user must implement the internal tasks that JavaScript did automatically.

```js
function Person() {
// No instance member definition
}

// Define a prototype member of a person
Person.prototype.species = 'human';

// Korean Definition
function Korean() {
// No instance member definition
}
// Define prototype members of Korean
Korean.prototype.nationality = 'korea';

Korean.prototype = new Person();
Korean.prototype.constructor = Korean;
```

The code above uses an instance of Person as a Korean prototype object and changed the constructor property value of Korean prototype object to a reference to the Korean constructor.

This code is to replace the original Korean prototype object with a Person instance, and once the bottom two-line code is executed, it will result in the addition of the person`s prototype object to the Korean prototype chain.

You can now create and use a Korean instance to use specifications that are not defined by Korean.

The following code is used to create an instance of Korean that completed the inheritance of prototype members.

```js
function Person() {
// No instance member definition
}

// Define a prototype member of a person
Person.prototype.species = 'human';

// Korean Definition
function Korean() {
// No instance member definition
}

Korean.prototype = new Person();
Korean.prototype.constructor = Korean;

// Define prototype members of Korean
Korean.prototype.nationality = 'korea';

var obj = new Korean();
var species = obj.species;
console.log(species); // human 반환
var nationality = obj.nationality;
console.log(nationality); // korea 반환
```

The following shows the results of the instance of operation for the Korean instance.

```js
var p = new Korean();
console.log(p instanceof Korean); // true 반환
console.log(p instanceof Person); // true 반환
```

Other documents also describe how to inherit this prototype member as "prototype inheritance".

### Implement inheritance of instance members - call/apply

When developing JavaScript, there are times when you want to use not only prototype members but also instance members in the parent object.

Now we learn how to make instance members defined in their parents available to their children`s instances as well.

How can an instance member defined in a parent object be used by a child object?

Normal object-oriented languages provide methods such as `base()` or `super()`. So when you create a child object, you can have it call it and create a parent object.

In general object-oriented languages, parent objects and child objects are created separately and are automatically inherited.

However, JavaScript does not provide functions or methods such as `base()` or `super()`.

So how do we implement instance inheritance?

Summarize the situation you are trying to explain.

Suppose the person has an instance member name defined as follows:

And in Korean, the instance property called city is defined as follows.

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name; // define instance member
}

function Korean(name, city) {
This.city = city; // instance member definition
}
```

Instance Member Inheritance

Under these circumstances, suppose you want to use the instance member name defined in Person on an instance created with Korean.

Can I call the person directly from the Korean constructor?

```js
function Korean(name, city) {
Person(name);

// Define instance members of Korean
this.city = city;
}
```

Then create an instance of Korean and approach the name.

```js
function Person(name) {
// Define an instance member of a person
this.name = name;
}

function Korean(name, city) {
Person(name);

// Define instance members of Korean
this.city = city;
}
var my Son = new Korean ('Jae-hee,' Seoul');
console.log(mySon.name); // undefined 를 반환
```

As you can see, undefined is printed that the name is not defined in the instance of Korean.

You did not specify the object that owns the Person member when calling the Person directly from the Korean constructor as before.

Therefore, the person is considered a member of the root object and this used inside the person points to the root object.

A browser refers to a Window object.

Therefore, you are adding the name property to the root object of the global variable scope.

In this case, you can use Function`s `call` or `apply` to make this used inside the person look at the desired object.

In other words, the execution context of the person can be set to the execution context of Korean.

The modified Korean constructor code is as follows.

```js
function Person(name) {
// Define an instance member of a person
this.name = name;
}

function Korean(name, city) {
// Call the parent constructor.
// assign the first factor of the call or apply function to this within the parent constructor.
// The following code assigns this instance of the Korean type to this of the Person constructor.
// In the end, the parent constructor person adds the name attribute to the Korean instance that was delivered as a factor.
Person.apply(this, [name]); // 또는 Person.call(this, name);

// Define instance members of Korean
this.city = city;
}

var my Son = new Korean ('Jae-hee,' Seoul');
console.log (mySon.name); // Return 'Jaehee'
```

When you run new Korean, you create a Korean instance and then call the Korean constructor.

Assign the instance created to this in Korean.

When you call `Person.call/apply` inside the Korean constructor, the Korean instance just created is passed to this of the person constructor.

In the end, the `this` inside the person constructor.name = name` results in adding a name property member to the created Korean instance.

Integrating inheritance implementations

Now let`s think about implementing prototype inheritance and instance member inheritance together.

We revisit the code that implements prototype inheritance as we saw earlier.

```js
Korean.prototype = new Person();
Korean.prototype.constructor = Korean;
```

The first code replaces the Korean prototype object with the Person instance object.

However, the names in the prototype objects exist on a per-instance basis, so most of the prototype members will not be required.

Therefore, removing the name property from the prototype member completes the inheritance as follows:

```js
delete Korean.prototype.name;
```

You do not have to remove the name property from the prototype member.

When an instance member is transmitted as a prototype member, it is common to remove it because it is usually unnecessary, but it does not matter if it is left intact.

These actions are optional.

Lets you combine the code that implements instance member inheritance and prototype member inheritance.

Person and Korean include prototype members, species, nationality.

```js
'// Person constructor
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}
// Define a prototype member of a person
Person.prototype.species = 'human';

// Korean constructor
function Korean(name, city) {
// Inherit instance members
Person.call(this, name); // 또는 Person.apply(this, [name]);

// Korean instance member
this.city = city;
}
Korean.prototype.nationality = 'korean';

// Inherit prototype members
Korean.prototype = new Person();
Korean.prototype.constructor = Korean;

// The following code is optional in the inheritance implementation:
delete Korean.prototype.name;
```

Now let`s create an instance of Korean type mySon and try to print out all the members.

```js
var mySon = new Korean('재희님', 'seoul');
// Member Output
// Declare an array to hold properties
var arr = [];
for(var propertyName in mySon) {
arr.push(propertyName);
}
// Array Output
console.log(arr); // ["name", "city", "constructor", "species"]
```

### Expand Members

We discussed earlier how to inherit prototype members using the constructor`s `prototype` property and how to inherit instance members using Function`s `call/apply` function.

However, JavaScript also has other simple ways to mimic inheritance.

Inheritance is what eventually makes all the members of the parent object available to the child object.

Therefore, copying all members of a parent object to a child object seems a bit simple, but it`s a simple way to implement inheritance in JavaScript.

You can use `for/in` to copy parent objects to child objects.

You can copy members conveniently by making the following utility methods a prototype member of an object:

```js
Object.prototype.extend = function (parent) {
for(var property in parent) {
this[property] = parent[property];
}
};
```

`for/in` provides access to all user-defined prototype members and instance members (attributes, methods).

The methods defined above can be used as follows:

```js
Object.prototype.extend = function (parent) {
for(var property in parent) {
this[property] = parent[property];
}
};

function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}
Person.prototype.setNewName = function (newName) {
this.name = newName;
};
// Create Parent Object
var parent = new Person('재희야');

// Create Child Object
var child = {};

// member inheritance
child.extend(parent)
```

When you run `child.extend(parent)` you will see that this used inside the extend method points to the child object.

When you expand a member of a child object in this way, all instance members and prototype members of the parent are added as instance members of the child because of the `for/in` characteristics used by `extend`.

When you print out the members added to child, it is as follows.

```js
var arr = [];
for (var property in child) {
If(child.hasOwnProperty(property)) { // Verify that you are an instance member
arr.push(property);
}
}
console.log(arr); // ["name", "setNewName", "extend"] 반환
```
