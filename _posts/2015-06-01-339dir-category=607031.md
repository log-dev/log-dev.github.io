### CSS selector

In CSS, a selector is a pattern used to select elements that want a style.

### Selectors

All elements of the document are selected using the `*` symbol.

```css
* {
backgrond-color: green;
}

```

The desired element is selected as the element name.

```css
p {
color: #ffffff;
background-color: green;
}

```

The element is selected consisting of the value of the corresponding id attribute.

```css
#header {
position: relative;
}

```

The element is selected consisting of the value of the class attribute.

```css
.header {
position: relative;
}

```

The chain selector is used when multiple classes are specified in one element, as shown below.

```html
<div class="class1">class1</div>
<div class="class2">class2</div>
<div class="class1 class2 class3">.class1.class2.class3</div>

```

```css
.class1, .class2 {
background-color: blue;
}

.class1.class2.class3 {
background-color: green;
}

```

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | O |
| IE8 | O |

At first glance, it seems to be supported by IE6, but in fact, if the last class of the chain is given, it will be applied unconditionally. It is normal only when all three classes are given.

Select all immediate children (except grandchildren) of the parent element. In the example below, body is the parent and p is the child.

```css
body > p {
color:#fff;
}

```

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | O |
| IE8 | O |

IE7 does not work if there is an annotation between the parent and the child.

The sibling choice applies to all sibling elements after the element specified earlier.

```html
<p>First</p>
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>Sibling</p>
<p>Sibling</p>

```

```css
h1 ~ p {
background-color: green;
}

```

For the above code, it applies to both ps below. However, it does not apply to p in front of heading (h1).

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | O |
| IE8 | O |

Adjacent sibling selectors only apply to one sibling element that is closest since the previously specified element. The example code below finds only the nearest p element since h1.

```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>First Sibling</p>
<p>Second Sibling</p>

```

```css
h1 + p {
background-color: green;
}

```

In the above code, the CSS applies only to the first p and not to the second.

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | O |
| IE8 | O |

IE7 does not work if there is an annotation between the parent and the child.

Only attributes are used as selectors and even values of attributes are used.

It selects the element where a particular property exists and expresses the property name in brackets.

```css
p[title] {
padding: 5px;
border: 1px solid gray;
}

```

Note that some browsers do not select elements with empty attribute values, such as `=`.

Selects an element that contains a particular word in the value of a given property.

```css
p[title="love"]

```

Select a word that contains a specific value.

```html
<p title="First love">

```

```css
p[title~="love"]

```

Select the element that starts with a specific value.

```html
<p title="lovelikeu">

```

```css
p[title^="love"]

```

Select an element that ends with a specific value.

```html
<p title="Lastlove">

```

```css
p[title$="love"]

```

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | O |
| IE8 | O |

### Virtual Class

A property can be given to the lower offspring only if the :hover is operational.

```css
a:hover span {
color: #0f0;
}

```

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | O |
| IE8 | O |

Virtual classes can be continuously used. In the example below, it only applies when the first a is hovered.

```css
a:first-child:hover {
color: #0f0;
}

```

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | O |
| IE8 | O |

In IE6, the virtual class was only available in a, but after IE7, it was also available in other components.

```css
div:hover {
color:#f00;
}

```

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | O |
| IE8 | O |

Applies only to the first child element.

```css
div li:first-child {
background:blue;
}

```

Add virtual content to the specified element. content property is valid only.

```css

content: "this text is before the box";
}

}

```

### Property Support

The element that gives the top, right, bottom, and left values as absolute values is set to a virtual area even if width and height are not specified.

```css
#box {

Interestingly, IE6 and IE7 can be used by spacing instead of comma. (This grammar is almost disappearing.)

The orphans property sets the minimum number of lines to be shown at the bottom of the printed page. The wideows property sets the minimum number of lines to show at the top of the printed page. (I don`t know why it was named orphans and widows.)

```css
p {

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | X |
| IE8 | O |

Outline is a abbreviated notation for outline-style, outline-width, and outline-color properties. This property creates a border that does not affect the document flow (i.e., using this property does not affect the box model).Even if the outline is inserted, close components are not pushed out, so it can be useful when marking focus.)

```css
#box {
outline: solid 1px red;
}

```

- table-caption
- table-cell
- table-column
- table-column-group
- table-footer-group
- table-header-group
- table-row
- table-row-group

Pre-line, a value that can be used in the white-space property, prevents multiple spaces from being entered in one area (using the word Collapse by describing it as folding) Pre-wrap values allow multiple spaces to be entered in one area.

```css
p {
white-space: pre-line;
}

div {
white-space: pre-wrap;
}

```

### Other techniques.

It can be applied only to the media by attaching a media type to the inserted style sheet file.

```css
@import url("style.css") screen;

```

| IE Version | Supported or Not |
| ----- | ----- |
| IE6 | X |
| IE7 | X |
| IE8 | O |

IE6, IE7 ignores the @import declaration itself when a media type is specified.

You can use virtual content to attach counters to CSS.(The counter sticks in the same way as in OL.)

```css
h2 {
counter-increment: headers;
}

h2:before {
content:counter(headers) ". ";
}

```

### Other bugs and incompatible parts

These are bugs not explained above.

- Cannot style abbr tag.
- It does not support classes or IDs starting with hyphens (-) or underscores (_).
- Select tags are not eaten by z-index and always appear in the top layer.
- If the virtual classes of a are not specified in order, :over is ignored. (:link, :visited, :hover)
- Re-defining the same property in the same manner with !important will overwrite the value.
- The height acts like a min-height.
- The width acts like a min-width.
- If the element is margined in the same direction as the plotted direction, a double value is applied.
- Dotted boards appear in the same shape as dashed boards.
- Text-decoration:line-through appears above other browsers.
- The list counter marking of OL does not work properly.
- All available values in the list-style-type defined in the standard are not available.
- If plotted, list items defined as list-style-image do not appear.
- It only partially supports @font-face. (Like it`s an eot story.
- Some selectors will longly match comments and the doctype clarification.
- When an unused class is pasted to an ID selector, the style designation of another class to the same ID is also ignored.

- The list counter marking of OL does not work properly.
- All available values in the list-style-type defined in the standard are not available.
- If plotted, list items defined as list-style-image do not appear.
- It only partially supports @font-face. (Like it`s an eot story.
- Some selectors will longly match comments and the doctype clarification.

IE bugs not mentioned here are those that occur only in certain circumstances, or those that do not arise from specific attributes or values. For more information, see the following materials.
