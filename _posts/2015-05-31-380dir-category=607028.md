While using XAMPP, a duplicate error occurred on the 443 port. This was a problem with VMWare, which was being used as a virtual machine, and we look at this solution.

### Troubleshooting XAMPP Problems

In my case, an error occurred because VMWare was using port 443 and the Apache failed to run. Similarly, similar errors will occur if other programs are using 80 and 443 ports that will be used by default in Apache.

```undefined
오전 11:24:03 [Apache] Problem detected!
오전 11:24:03 [Apache] Port 443 in use by ""C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\vmware-hostd.exe" -u "C:\ProgramData\VMware\hostd\config.xml"" with PID 2468!
오전 11:24:03 [Apache] Apache WILL NOT start without the configured ports free!
오전 11:24:03 [Apache] You need to uninstall/disable/reconfigure the blocking application
오전 11:24:03 [Apache] or reconfigure Apache and the Control Panel to listen on a different port

```

- Run VMWare
- Edit > Preferences
- Shared VMs :
Change Settings 클릭
When sharing is active, it is not possible to change the port, so disable it.
Change the port. (ex. 11443)
Activate sharing again.
Press OK to exit.

Restart Apache again and the problem will be solved and executed.

It can be solved by leaving the port in VMWare and changing the port in the httpd-ssl.conf file and changing the port in Config > Service and Port Settings in the XAMPP Control Panel.
