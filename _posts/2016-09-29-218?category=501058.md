DOM(Document Object Model)

To subdivide JavaScript, there are four elements.

A DOM is a mass of each library that is filled with functions for manipulating elements visible on the browser screen.

(Usually, JavaScript DOM or DOM is used in the same sense.)

The typical features provided by DOM are divided into multiple DOM objects, as shown in the image above.

Let`s take a closer look.

### D : Document

Document object models do not work without documents.

The moment you create a document to use on the web and print it out to a web browser, the DOM begins to move alive.

And this is possible because the web document that was created is changed to an object.

### O : Object

JavaScript can be divided into three types of objects.

> 1.Custom object
2. Built-in objects already created in JavaScript, such as arrays, mathematics, and dates.
3.Key Objects Provided by Web Browsers

In the early days of JavaScript, several important objects were used to create scripts, the most fundamental of which is a window object.

These objects represent properties inside a web browser window, also known as the Browser Object Model (BOM).

A browser object model is something like window.open or window.blur, for example (this is a topic that deviates from the contents of the DOM).

The DOM is the target of a document object that handles the contents of a web document in a browser window.

> BOM -> Properties in Browser Window
DOM -> refers to the contents of a Web document in a browser window.

### Man: Model (Model)

The most important rule used by DOM is to represent documents in a tree-like structure.

These structural plots are the best way to represent documents in (X)HTML.

<html> is the parent of all elements, <head> and <body> form a sibling relationship, and this is how the basic document structure is to establish a parent/child relationship.

This form is called a node tree.

node : A network refers to a set of nodes that a network displays to connect a point to a point.

In the real world, everything is made up of atoms, atoms are nodes in the world, protons and electrons smaller than atoms are called nodes.

Similarly, a DOM is also a collection of nodes, and a document has nodes such as branches and leaves on top of a tree.
