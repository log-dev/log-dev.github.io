Object constructor`s trap

When object literals are available, there is no reason to write the `new Object()` constructor, but it is necessary to know one `function` of the constructor because it may inherit legacy code written by others.

This is also why generators should not be used after all use constructors.

The function of the problem is that the `Object()` constructor can receive the factor.

Depending on the value passed to the factor, the constructor function can delegate the creation of an object to another embedded constructor, which may result in a return of a different object than expected.

Here are some examples of passing numbers, strings, and Boolean values to `new Object():

Returns an object created with a different constructor than expected.

```js
'// Warning: All anti-patterns.

// Empty Object
var obj = new Object();
console.log(obj.constructor === Object); // true 가 기록

// Numeric objects
var obj = new Object(10);
console.log(obj.constructor === Number); // true 가 기록
obj.toFixed(2); // 1.00 Recorded

// String object
var obj = new Object('I am a string');
console.log(obj.constructor === String); // true 가 기록
// A typical object does not have a method called substring(), but it is in a string object.
console.log(typeof obj.substring); // function This record

// Called Object
var obj = new Object(true);
console.log(obj.constructor === Boolean); // true 가 기록
```

Because of this behavior of the `Object()` constructor, unexpected results may be returned if the dynamic value determined at runtime is passed to the constructor as a factor.

As I repeat, do not use `new object()` in conclusion.

We recommend using simpler and more reliable object literals.
