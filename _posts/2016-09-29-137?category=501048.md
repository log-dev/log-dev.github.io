Object-Oriented Programming - OOP

Object-oriented programming is programming objects by linking them to gain advantages of increasing code reuse and reducing maintenance by using encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.

These are concepts that come out countless times through books and searches. However, this concept is unfamiliar and difficult for me, who started out as a publisher. In this posting, we will simply approach the publisher`s occupation by using JavaScript to get closer to OOP.

### First, what is an object?

An object is a modeling of the real world.

OOP is a programming paradigm that uses abstraction to model real world.

Abstract literally means ignoring detailed information and summarizing only the information that needs to be there.

Let`s take an example of a mouse.

Suppose you have a mouse modeled in the real world now, but you don`t have a mouse, so you want to model it.

You can start defining with the idea that you want to click and scroll to make your computer more comfortable.

To further abstract, left-click area, right-click area, scroll area... Designing in this way is an abstraction task.

It`s simply a summary of the information that needs to be there.

Because of the mouse`s abstraction, the left, right areas, scrolls, etc. are called properties, properties, and properties in programming.

Another example is working on abstraction.

â–  Person object

> 1. Heart
2. Eyes, nose, mouth
3. Name
4. Gender
5. Kidney (Key)
6. Think about it
7. Run.
8. He's sleeping.

You can make abstractions by objectifying people, etc. But people can`t fly, so they can`t abstract `flying`!

It is abstraction in object-oriented programming that is said to abstract this common information and approached and bonded to the world of programming.

The lists defined in the above person objects are programmatically properties, and the verb acts of `think`, `run`, and `sleep` are called methods in programming. (Method - How to make him jump, how to make him think)

As such, abstraction should contain only the qualities common to all objects.

### Abstract in JavaScript:

Because JavaScript does not provide abstract classes and interfaces, you must use only classes to work with abstractions. Because only classes must be used, you cannot apply conventions, such as those that the class must be implementing, which are features of the interface.

JavaScript provides three ways to make and use similar to a class.

2) Function utilization method
3) Prototype method
