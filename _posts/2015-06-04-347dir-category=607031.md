Learn about overflow properties that control parts of the CSS properties beyond the size of the element.

### overflow

Specifies the expression method when the box of elements overflows with content.

```css
div {
width: 150px;
height: 150px;
overflow: scroll;
}

```

- Abbreviated properties for overflow-x and overflow-y properties.
- The second value of this property is optional and applies to both overflow-x and overflow-y properties if only one value is specified.

- visible: mark overflowing content beyond element box without cutting it. This is the default.
- Hidden: Cut out overflowing content and make it invisible.
- scroll : truncates overflowing content but displays scroll bar.
- auto : Cut content when overflowing, but scrollbar is displayed.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

The inherit value is not supported below IE7. IE8 requires !DOCTYPE. IE9 to support normally.

### overflow-style

The properties added to CSS3 specify how well the browser supports and how the overflow properties are executed, which determines how much scrolling is done according to the user`s preference. By default, values are inherited.

```css
.class1 {overflow-style: marquee-block;}

```

- auto : The browser determines how to scroll and displays the scroll bar if it determines that the content has been truncated.
- move: allows content to be dragged by a mouse pointer.
- scrollbar: Displays a typical scroll bar.
- marque: Content moves independently of user events.
- Panner: Two nested squares are generated. A small rectangle is an area where content is visible and can be moved by a user within a large rectangle.

### overflow-x, overflow-y

The properties added to CSS3 determine how content is handled when overflowing horizontally or vertically.

```css
div {overflow-x: hidden;}

```

- visible: content is not truncated but potentially invisible.
- hidden : content is truncated and scrolling is not supported.
- Scroll : Content is truncated and scrolls are always supported.
- auto : The browser determines how to scroll and, if necessary, displays the scroll bar.
- No-display: If the contents are not matched to the box size, the box will be invisible as if the `display:none` property is applied.
- No-content: If the content does not fit into the box size, the content will be invisible as if the visibility:hidden property has been applied.

IE8 and earlier versions do not support overflow-x and overflow-y attributes.

### text-overflow

We determine how to handle the overflow of strings within an element with properties added to CSS3.

```css
div {text-overflow: ellipsis;}

```

- clip : truncate text.
- ellipsis: Displays a ellipsis (...) to indicate that the text is truncated.
- string : print the specified string.

This property seems to have existed unofficially from the past.
