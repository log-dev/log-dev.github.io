About the mobile environment

Mobile means "moving" or "free to move," which refers to devices characterized by portability and mobility.

In other words, the smartphone, tablet PC, which is currently used a lot, is a device in the category of mobile, and the mobile web refers to the optimized web for devices in this category of mobile.

### Mobile Web and Mobile Apps

A mobile app is also an app optimized for devices in the mobile category.

The term "app" here refers to an application developed on the basis of a software development kit (SDK) provided by an operating system or platform, and usually refers to a native app.

And native apps are called native apps that users download from the iPhone App Store or Google Android Market.

Features and differences between mobile web and mobile apps

The mobile web works as an HTML-based web browser, and the biggest difference from the PC web is that it has a small screen size, a touch screen interface, and provides mobile-specific features such as `Click-to-Call`.

The mobile app is a method that you use after installing (downloading) directly to your device.

Available services are divided according to the platform (iOS, Android), and content can be used without web content (hybrid app) or Internet connection.

Mobile webs and mobile apps have different ways of operating, different operating systems and platforms, so there is a single chapter of each.

To recapitulate, the mobile web and mobile apps have the same role of providing services or content, but are divided by the platform and implementation method that works.

This technological difference divides the development into mobile webs or mobile apps depending on the purpose of the service or content.

Mobile Web

- Use the mobile web if you want to provide content that is constantly updating, such as product reviews, blogs, news, etc., which is usually aimed at continuing to provide new information.
- Mobile web is a service that works with web browsers, so users can use it if they know the URL information.
- According to web standards, it operates on a variety of platforms, making development productivity high and easy to maintain.

Mobile App

- Mobile apps are often used in areas where hardware performance needs to be high, such as games and music, or where hardware needs to be controlled by mobile devices.
- Mobile apps need to be developed differently depending on the operating system or platform, so they are less raw and difficult to maintain.
- It is not easy to deploy and install because it needs to be downloaded from different app stores depending on the platform.
- Compared to the mobile web, its superior performance and ability to control the hardware of mobile devices are the biggest advantages of mobile apps.

Overcoming the Limits of the Mobile Web

The mobile web continues to overcome the weaknesses of the mobile web, which is slower to run than mobile apps and cannot control the hardware of mobile devices, the performance of browsers, rendering engines, and JavaScript engines (V8), and hardware acceleration technologies are being improved.

### About how mobile apps are developed

Even when creating a mobile app, it is divided into the purpose of the service and how it will be developed according to various environments.

Native App

As mentioned above, a native app is an application developed based on SDK, or an app developed using the mobile platform API.

It is also used as an executable file that is downloaded directly to your mobile device and stored locally (on your device).

Developed in a language optimized for mobile devices, it includes Android apps made using Android SDK to java languages and iPhone apps developed in Objective-C languages using iOS SDK.

And there are the following characteristics.

- High-performance graphics processing allows users to develop apps such as 2D and 3D games or augmented reality.
- Updates are slow because they operate only on certain platforms and can be updated through the app store.
- Different operating systems or platforms have the disadvantage of having to develop new ones at the expense of a lot of time and money.

Web App (Web App)

The web app is a combination of the mobile web and the native app (web + app), which has the characteristics of the mobile web and also has the advantages of the native app.

In other words, an app that is implemented with web technology. This app is more mobile-optimized than the mobile web.

Because the general definition of a web app is `an application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using a browser`, the Internet service that users use by entering the web address directly in the address window of a mobile browser is also within the category of the web app.

You can place an icon in your smartphone`s home instead of letting users type the address of the website so that the app can run when you click the icon like a native app, or hide the browser address input window with a tag, making the appearance and behavior look like a native app.

Web apps have the following characteristics:

- Developed by common web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSP, PHP, ASP, and ASP NET, like the mobile web.
- Make all UI and UX similar to apps while using web development technology
- running in mobile browser
- Runs faster than the mobile web
- Because it is not installed like a native app, users open a browser and access the URL to run the web app.
- The first page is full-browsing from the web, then processing everything with AJAX communication, animation effect on screen switching, user touch event processing, AJAX communication, HTML5 local storage to provide a native app-like execution environment.

And web apps and mobile webs have the following in common:

- It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based web technologies equally.
- Sensors and cameras provided by the hardware of mobile devices cannot be used.
- The API provided by the smartphone operating system or platform is not available.
- It uses only an operating system or platform, and an API that provides a browser for use.

Hybrid App (Hybrid App)

It is the hybrid app that secures the disadvantages of the web app above.

In other words, a hybrid app literally means that it uses native apps and web app-based technologies together.

When developing native apps, whether it`s an iPhone or Android, it should be produced in the programming language provided by each operating system or platform.

While this benefits from providing optimized capabilities for the operating system or mobile device, it also has the disadvantage of having to develop new ones at the expense of time and expense if the operating system or platform is different.

However, if you create a hybrid app, this will change.

The content area underlying the app is produced by HTML-based web apps and only packaging processing required for the final app distribution is done within the platforms of the iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android.

Regardless of the fact that the programming language is different, it provides an environment where you can create a variety of apps conveniently and saves time and money.

As such, web publishers can design and develop their own apps and distribute them to app stores and Android markets.

To sum up, a hybrid app is the packaging of a web app as a native app, but it is developed as a web technology to make it look like a native app in a mobile-optimized language, so it can be downloaded from an app store or market, used mobile information, and controlled.

The next app of Naver`s favorite app is a hybrid app.

When creating hybrid apps, a separate hybrid framework is required to support hybrid apps.

Representatively, there are PhoneGap and Titanium developed overseas, and there is Appspresso provided by KTH in Korea.

### Boundaries of how mobile apps are developed

There are many ways to develop mobile apps like this.

And technically, there are obvious differences, but they also include the mobile web in a large development methodology category.

In some cases, clearly distinguishing between native apps, hybrid apps, and web apps is not very meaningful.

In this situation, using the web when developing content-oriented apps can be a matter of how much you want to use, not of whether you apply it or not of how much you want to use it.

The native API allows us to provide a more sophisticated UI with better performance than using the web and facilitates device control, but the development is burdensome.

However, due to improved hardware performance and improved browser performance, the performance gap between native and web apps is decreasing, and there are many ways to control devices in web browsers.It seems that the boundaries between the web app and the hybrid app will become more ambiguous.
