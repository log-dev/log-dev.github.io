All Web documents begin with a declaration of Documentation Definition (DTD). Once you have correctly identified the objectives and objectives of the website, you must first decide whether to mark up with HTML or XHTML or HTML5.You should also consider whether to use illuminating elements and attributes to implement the capabilities required to create a website.

### What is DOCTYPE Definition and Declaration (DTD)?

Document Type Definition (DTD) has three types of documents: HTML5, XHTML, and HTML. Depending on the type described, it is the basis for processing elements and attributes of a markup document and is used for validation.

If documentary definitions are omitted, cross-browsing is difficult because the web browser is rendered in non-standard mode rather than standard mode. Document-type definitions should be at the top of HTML documents.

Previous versions of HTML (HTML2–HTML4) are based on Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), which requires a DTD reference, which requires the creation of a long string containing public identifiers and system identifiers.

HTML and XHTML detail the tags and attributes available in each version as DTDs. DTD is a law that imposes logical structures on classes of XML documents. Therefore, DTD writes all legitimate markups and specifies where and how they can be included in the documentation. These element phrases or grammar define the meaning of elements and their properties.

### HTML5 DOCTYPE Declaration

HTML5 is not based on SGML, so no DTD reference is required, and minimal code writing is the default direction, so it can be declared very simply.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Although the DOCTYPE declaration is optional, it is recommended to use the above for backward compatibility.

### XHTML 1.0 DOCTYPE 선언

With the advent of HTML 5, it is less likely to insist on XHTML 1.0.

A document type intended by the W3C that excludes elements and attributes about expressions that will disappear step by step to separate structures and representations. center, font, iframe, strike, u, new windows are restricted.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
```

It is used to maintain compatibility with existing documents. Iframes and new windowsill (target="_blank") are available, which is recommended when using XHTML.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
```

It is currently used to implement framesets that are rarely used.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1-frameset.dtd">
```

All XML documents begin with a declaration that tells the browser how to interpret XML. An XML declaration or prologue is defined prior to the DOCTYPE and namespace declaration, and defining the type or markup language of the document. For example, the following:

```html
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

```

Some older versions of browsers (IE6) are blocked by the `<?xml` prologue and display blank pages. In addition, Internet Explorer 4 and 5 for Mac and Nescape Navigator 4 do not recognize the <?xml syntax, causing malfunction when encountering a web page with an XML prologue. Prologue, like PHP, sometimes causes problems with server-based analysis engines.

Therefore, W3C made the prologue optional. In other words, it is possible to omit the prologue from the HTML page or to include it conditionally for a new version of the browser. If you want to use a set of characters other than the default UTF-8 or UTF-16, or if you do not want to use a prologue, you can use the tag `metahttp-equiv` as shown below instead of the prologue.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

```

### HTML 4.01 DOCTYPE Declaration

There are no documents written in HTML 4.01 these days, but we leave a record.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">
```

### DOCYPE and MIME Differences

The Web server checks each document it sends as a Multipart Internet Mail Extensions (MIME). MIME is sometimes referred to as the content type. This content type is included in the HTTP head element of the document, and the browser determines how the document is processed according to the content type. When a document with content type `text/html` is received, the browser renders the document in HTML.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

```

According to XHTML Media Types, a web server sends XHTML to one of three content types:

- text/html: XHTML documents can be sent to `text/html` unless the browser recognizes the document as XML, and other XML namespaces contain MathML-like content. Such a sent document is recognized by the browser as HTML and processed.
- Application/xhtml+xml: When XHTML is sent to `application/xhtml+xml`, IE7 and lower versions fail to display this type of page.
- XML: Browsers that fail to process `application/xhtml+xml` such as IE7 and earlier recognize this document as a generic XML, ignoring the semantic meaning of all XHTML, so links and forms fail to function and take much longer to render.

The Gecko browser fully downloads documents received in the XML content type and renders them after confirming that there are no coding errors at all. It renders the document in Strict mode, regardless of DOCTYPE.

Currently, `text/html` is the most reliable content type for sending XHTML web pages. This type is supported by W3C and is recognized by most browsers. With this formatting, the browser is HTML-aware and works well without validation (if application/xhtml+xml, it automatically completes the validation of the document and renders it). The browser parses web pages in a format that can be displayed in any version of HTML or XHTML, regardless of whether there is an error or not. On the other hand, XHTML documents have a browser preventing the entire rendering of XHTML documents through various XML commands, even with minor errors.
