Learn about the basic security of Apache.

### Remove Indexes

Remove the Indexes value from the Options value of the < indicator. This results in directory structure and file list output, which is a security risk.

Many sites use Apache as their web server, and the most popular web server script in UNIX/Linux systems is PHP.

In addition, MySQL, a free, high-performance DBMS (especially speed), is often used, and there are disadvantages that are prone to bug attacks because there are a lot of users in the Apache because bugs are found quickly. Marking Apache and php versions differently from the actual version can make it difficult for hackers to attempt access with the wrong version of the vulnerability.

```undefined
[root@server conf]# telnet 211.174.61.27 80
Trying 211.174.61.27...
Connected to 211.174.61.27.
Escape character is '^]'.

GET / HTTP/1.0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 26 Dec 2000 10:23:34 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix) PHP/4.0.3pl1

```

As shown above, if you approach normally, the Apeach version and php version will also come out. After seeing this, hackers will try to access the bug by version.

Therefore, hiding the actual version information can help secure the server a little bit, so let`s find out how to display this part differently from the actual set version. Another way is to simply hide the version information of apache.

You can open the /usr//local/apache/conf/httpd.conf file and add this statement.

```undefined
ServerTokens ProductOnly

```

And when I restart the web daemon and test it,

```undefined
[root@server conf]# telnet 211.174.61.27 80
Trying 211.174.61.27...
Connected to 211.174.61.27.
Escape character is '^]'.

GET / HTTP/1.0
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 26 Dec 2000 10:30:45 GMT
Server: Apache

```

In this way, it is only marked Apache.
