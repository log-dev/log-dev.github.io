this 와 Object

When an object calls a function in a structured (hierarchical) connected form, let`s look more specifically at the object this references.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/252CD63C57F2EED707)

Let`s take a look at the following code.

```js
var cody = {
foo: 123,
bar: {
foo: 456,
func: function() {
console.log(this === cody.bar) // true
console.log(this.foo) // 456
}
}
};

cody.bar.func();
```

When calling func on a hierarchical object, it calls cody.bar.func().

where "cody" acts as a namespace and this refers to the bar object written before func.

That is, when calling a function, this refers to the object written immediately preceding the function. (You can think of it as right in front of you.)

Let`s take a closer look at the following codes while remembering this point.

```js
var cody = {
foo: 123,
bar: function() {
console.log(this === cody); // false
console.log(this === window); // true
console.log(this.foo); // undefined
}
};

// Assign cody.bar to variables
var callFn = cody.bar;

// CallFn() to call function
callFn();
```

The difference from the first code is that it refers to the cody.bar function in a variable and calls callFn() instead of calling the function immediately.

The meaning of this code is that this binding of the execution context is set up as a global object, because the callFn() form calls the function without specifying the object.

In other words, this refers to a global object because it was not written before the function when calling the function in callFn() form.

Again, when calling a function, remember that this refers to the object written before the function.
