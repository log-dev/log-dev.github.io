prototype-based class foundation

### Characteristics

1) Code reuse function

You can create and reuse multiple instances just like a function-based class (generator pattern).

2) Method sharing capabilities

Functional classes that seem to have no drawbacks have fatal drawbacks. Every instance has its own internal method created independently. However, because prototypes inherit a prototype object for every instance, there is only one method because each instance does not create a method independently, but because it is inherited and used.

In other words, inheritance is implemented using prototype.

For example, `string`.toString().

### Prototype Class Grammar Type

In the object-oriented programming category, we will summarize the refactoring process from procedure-oriented to object-oriented function-based classes to prototype-based class methods.
