You can set up XFast RAM by installing AXTU, a utility provided by the ASRock mainboard. You can install only XFast Ram separately, but it may not work well with Windows 8.1 yet.

> The UI of the setup utility may vary depending on the type of main board. The big context is similar, so it won't be too hard to refer to.

### XFast RAM Settings

- Set the drive letter and ramdisk size in SETTINGS.
X: Drive, 4Gb allocation (allocate desired amount)
- X: Drive, 4Gb allocation (allocate desired amount)
- OPTIONS SETTING CONTENTS
Memory Pagefile : Set virtual memory (paged file) to ramdisk
Control Panel > Systems and Security > Systems > Advanced System Settings > Performance - Settings > Advanced Tab
Before the change, there was a 3Gb paging file on the C: drive, and after the change, the C: drive`s paging file was deleted and the X:(RAMDisk) drive was created with 2Gb paging file.
System Temporary Files: OS Self- or applications store temporary files generated when using the OS`s library in RAM, enabling quick read and write, which improves the performance of the system.
User Temporary Files: This significantly improves the loading speed of files by storing temporary files generated when users use applications, etc. in RAM.
Control Panel > Systems and Security > Systems > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables
IE Cache Files : Store IE`s cache file on RAM disk
A folder called CacheFiles is created on the X: drive.
Chrome Cache Files: It must be set manually.
Shortcut Icon > Properties
Add `--disk-cache-dir="X:\Web\Chrome" to the target.
Delete the existing cache file.
C:\Users\Douglas\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache
For other browsers, see http://cappleblog.co.kr/556.
Backup XFast RAM: When checked, shutting down the system does not delete the contents of the ramdisk.
When enabled, this feature takes up disk capacity because it requires storing information that was in RAM, and when the system is shut down, the information that was in RAM must be backed up to disk. It also takes time to read again when booting.

### Tips for moving Internet temporary files folders to RAM disks

- IE 6, 7, and 8 have problems downloading files that are larger than RAMDisk`s spare capacity, as the download completes the download to the Internet temporary folder and then moves them back to the location you specified.
- It is a structure that is played while downloading streaming videos in real time to a temporary folder on the Internet, so if the capacity of the ramdisk is small, the video may play, stop in the middle, and no longer proceed.

### Problems when using User Temporary Files

When User Temp Files is used, programs that do not run will occasionally occur.
