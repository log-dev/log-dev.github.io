This of the nested functions

We`ve learned about the basic usage of this keyword earlier.

### So how is this value referenced in a function within a function?

In the following code, this of func2 and func3 refers to a global object rather than an obj object.

Let`s look at the code below.

```js
var obj = {
func1 : function(){
console.log(this); // obj is recorded
// Define nested internal functions
var func2 = function() {
console.log(this); // window is recorded, from which the value of this continues to window.
// define nested functions again
var func3 = function() {
console.log(this); // window 가 기록
}();
}();
}
};

obj.func1();
```

This in this superimposed function refers to the global object, not to the object containing the function, or to the context called.

So, can`t we keep a reference to this of the parent function?

The nested function problem can be prevented from disappearing the value of this by storing a reference to this of the parent function using the scope chain.

The following code uses that variable and the scope of this variable to maintain this value even as the context of the function changes.

```js
var obj = {
prop : 'jaehee',
func1 : function(){
store obj, a reference to var that = this; // this, in the func1 function scope.
// Define nested internal functions
var func2 = function() {
// Record 'jaehee' through that(=this) scope chain.
console.log(that.prop);
// define nested functions again
var func3 = function() {
See console.log(that); // obj.
console.log(this); // window 가 기록
}();
}();
}
};

obj.func1();
```
