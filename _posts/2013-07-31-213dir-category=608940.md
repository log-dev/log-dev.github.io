Here is an example of VirtualHost in Ubuntu Apache. This article is based on the introduction of Digital Ocean, and I wrote it with a few flesh.

There are three ways to use VirtualHost, but many of them use NameVirtualHost. Ubuntu is also set for name-based virtual hosts by default.

By using a name-based virtual host, the main host disappears because ServerName or DocumentRoot is not specified in Ubuntu`s Apache setup file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.

When using a name-based host, the first virtual host setting is recognized as the main host, and in Ubuntu, the virtual host is the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file. Therefore, the ServerName and DocumentRoot indicators specified in this file point to the main host, so if you have a previously used primary host, you can write it in this file. This file is also used to create pages that will be shown instead if the requested appropriate virtual host is not found.

### 1.Create Directory for VirtualHost

Create a directory to use as the virtual host of the Apache.

```bash
Create a directory under the domain name "# example.com
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/public_html

# Create directory where logs will be stored
sudo mkdir /var/www/example.com/logs

```

### 2.Change directory permissions

Change the ownership of the public_html in which the files of the virtual host will be placed to the user ID and user group. You can change the user ID and user group to use the virtual host for $USER.

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER.$USER /var/www/example.com/public_html

```

Change access rights for anyone to access and read.

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www

```

### 3.Creating index files

Create an index.html file for site verification.

```bash
sudo vi /var/www/example.com/public_html/index.html

<html>
<body>
<h1>Hellow, World!</h1>
<h2>Here is example.com</h2>
</body>
</html>

```

### 4.Creating a VirtualHost file

Copy the virtual host file provided by Ubuntu as the default.

```bash
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/default /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com

```

### 5. VirtualHost Settings

Open the file to modify the virtual host file.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com

```

Register email contact when ServerAdmin encounters

```undefined
ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com

```

ServerName is missing, where you enter the domain name to be used by the virtual host

```undefined
ServerName example.com

```

Server Alias is also accessed by an alias, www.example.com (requires the registration of the name server).

```undefined
ServerAlias www.example.com

```

DocumentRoot enters address to be used as virtual host

```undefined
DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com/public_html

```

If there is no document you are looking for, you can also determine the error document that will be shown.

```undefined
ErrorDocument 404 /404.html

```

Change directory indicators to a virtual host directory address to use for /var/www

Remove Indexes from the Options values (if present, the files in the address that will be used as the virtual host will be listed, which is a security risk).

AllowOverride changes the value to All when using a .htaccess file, such as WordPress.

```undefined
<Directory /var/www/example.com/public_html>
Options FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride All
Order allow,deny
allow from all
</Directory>

```

Specifies where the log will be created (unless separated, logs for all virtual hosts will be written below the /var/log/apache2 directory, and should be removed).

```undefined
ErrorLog /var/www/example.com/logs/error.log
CustomLog /var/www/example.com/logs/access.log combined

```

### Enable VirtualHost

Register files that have been created and modified.

```bash
sudo a2ensite example.com
sudo service apache2 restart

```

### Virtual host default

Sites with addresses that are not registered in DNS will show the "Non-Found Page" provided by each browser. If you are registered with DNS but cannot find this page, follow the default setting (in my case, copy the default setting file that Apache provides by default, and modify the default file to use).

```undefined
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default

<VirtualHost _default_:80>
...

<Directory /var/www/>
Remove Indexes from Options
</Directory>


# No error log left
ErrorLog /dev/null

# Annotate and do not leave access logs
# CustomLog ...
...
</VirtualHost>

```

### TroubleShooting

The default settings for Ubuntu`s Apache2 are written with name-based virtual hosts in mind. If you restart the Apache for that reason, you can see the error message as below.

```undefined
apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName
... waiting apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName

```

If this error message is annoying, simply enter the appropriate NameServer value in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf. If you plan to use the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file, you may want to specify ServerName as the same value.
