Many people choose Heroku as the representative PaaS.
For me using Node.js, it`s a great service to host quickly and easily based on GitHub or Dropbox.
But Heroku is generally used for back-end hosting, and it felt a little bit cumbersome to host a simple static website.
In the meantime, I got to know Netflix and started using it.
Host static websites more easily and faster than Heroku.

# Netlify 란?

Netlity provides account interworking and easy hosting with GitHub and GitLab.
Provides a wide range of easy and fast services needed to create high-performance site/web applications, including CDN, Continuous Deployment, and One-Click HTTPS delivery.

# How to use Netlify

Let`s take a look at the simple but confusing parts one by one.

## Project Push to GitHub

If you have completed the Static website, push it to GitHub.
Usually, the degree of `public/` or `list/` becomes a static directory.
If it has a different name, you can set it up on Netflix.

> If you don't want to be stressed by repeated 'Deploy Failed' messages on Netlify, it is recommended to put 'index.html' inside the public directory.
If you are using a template engine such as EJS or PUG, push after compilation (build), and also compile and use CSS preprocessors such as SASS or Stylus.

## Create a new site in Netliffe

Go to Netify and sign-up.
I log on after registering as a member in the way I want.

You can select `New site from git` immediately after connecting.
You can then select a Git solution.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_1_new_site.jpg)

Supports the following Git solutions:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

### Access Restrictions

You can check `Limit GitHub access to public repositories.` before selecting a business.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_1_limit_github_access.jpg)

If you are concerned about granting access to sensitive storage, you can use GitHub to restrict application access.
You can find more information on Netify - GitHub Permissions.
Check if desired.

Since the project was pushed to GitHub in the previous stage, select `GitHub` from the company and proceed.

### Request Approval

If you have checked and crossed `Limit GitHub access to public repositories. What`s this?` you can see the following approval screen:
Select `Authorize netliffe` to approve.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_1_authorize_netlify.jpg)

Enter the GitHub password for permission settings.

### Select Storage

The list of my GitHub repository appears.
From here, find and select the repository that was push in the higher level.

### Default Build Settings

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_1_deploy_setting.jpg)

Set build commands if any.
For example, you can write commands for builds such as `npm start`, `npm run prod`, and `grunt`.
You don`t have to write down the value if you don`t need it.

Next, set up a static directory (Public Directory).
Usually, the degree of `public/` or `list/` becomes a static directory.
If not set, search at root (root, `/`).

Finally, press the `Deploy site` button to deploy a new site.
If it is well distributed after a little loading, you can see the message `Your site is deployed`.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_1_deploying_your_site.jpg)

If you see the `Deploy Failed` message, please check `Deploy Log` and we recommend you to change the project structure to match the Netlify.
You have now finished setting up step 1.

### Site Name (Domain) Settings

Our site distribution is finished and we can use it right away.
However, right now, you should use the following (unpretty) domains provided by Netflix:

```undefined
https://happy-noether-c27ffa.netlify.com/

```

You can use custom domains in two steps, but before that, you can modify (a little bit prettier) the domains provided by Netlif.

Select the `Site setting` button.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_1_site_setting_btn.jpg)

You can modify the name by clicking `Site information>
 Site name:`.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_1_site_naming.jpg)

You can choose a better distinguished name.
This is useful if you don`t have your own custom domain right now.

## Custom Domain Settings

Now let`s set up a separate custom domain.
Select `Set up a custom domain` in step 2.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_2_set_custom_domain.jpg)

Click the `Add custom domain` button to add my own domain.

### DNS Settings

The domain has been registered as follows and must be set up (`Set up Netify DNS`) for Netlif DNS:

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_2_set_up_netlify_dns.jpg)

You must create a DNS zone that will contain DNS records for the custom domain. This will automatically generate the required DNS records for the site.

### Change Name Server

As a final step, log in to the account of the domain provider (GoDady, Cafe24, Gabia, etc.) and change the name server to the host name provided.
For your information, I bought a domain from GoDaddy.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_2_update_nameserver_enter.jpg)

After changing the domain`s name server, wait a moment (5-10 minutes) to complete.
The custom domain is now available.

## Add HTTPS security and encryption with a free TLS certificate

Let`s add HTTPS security and encryption in step 3.
The biggest advantage of Netlify is that it automatically issues free SSL.
You can use HTTPS in a very simple procedure.

### Validate DNS Configuration

Select the `Secure your site with HTTPS` button in step 3.
In the `HTTPS` area in the middle of the page, select the `Verify DNS configuration` button.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_3_verify_dns_configuration.jpg)

Wait about 1 hour for DNS changes to propagate.

### Provision Let's Encrypt Certificate

Wait about an hour before the `Let`s Encrypt certificate` button is generated when HTTPS is ready for use.
When the button is pressed, Let`s Encrypt provides the TLS certificate and installs it on the CDN.

![image](https://heropy.blog/images/screenshot/netlify_3_encrypt_certificate.jpg)

Again, in a few minutes, provisioning of free certificates is complete.
If you want to pay for your use, you can donate through Donate to Let`s Encrypt.
For more information about Let`s Encrypt, see>
 Get HTTPS for free with Let`s Encrypt.

HTTPS is now available.

### Update Project

When you modify a project and push it to GitHub, Netlify builds and distributes it automatically.
It takes about 1~5 minutes to automatically distribute after push.

Until now, we have hosted HTTPS websites based on GitHub easily and quickly using Netlify.
If you want a free private store, GitLab would be a good choice.
