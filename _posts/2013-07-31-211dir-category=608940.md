In the past, PHP said APC would be included as a base, but for some reason, after PHP5.5 was released, ZendOptimizerPlus cache replaced APC. However, if you use PHP 5.3, there is nothing like APC, so you will find out how to install it.

### APC Installation

There are two ways to install APC in an environment where PHP is installed.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/22426D4F52148D691F)

Ubuntu 12.04 supports the php-apc 3.1.7-1 version.

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-apc
sudo service apache2 restart

```

### Installation Verification

Write phpinfo() on your website for APC-related information.

```php
sudo vi /var/www/phpinfo.php

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

```

### APC Management

If you installed apc from Ubuntu to apt-get, the apc.php.gz file exists in the /usr/share/doc/php-apc directory. In this file, an apc.php file exists, which can be copied and stored on the website where it operates, and accessed via a web browser to obtain information about cache using graphs (sometimes located in /usr/share/php/apc.php).

Copy to the desired site location.

```bash
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/php-apc/apc.php.gz /var/www

```

Unzip

```bash
sudo gzip -d /var/www/apc.php.gz

```

Restart Apache

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart

```

### APC Security

apc.php has various server information recorded, so it is managed by .htpasswd. This is only a security that can be done by Apache server groups, and if you use php, you use a lot of authentication using sessions using web pages.

First of all, we allow .htaccess by creating a controllable directory such as /var/www/apc in the apc.php file.

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/apc
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/php-apc/apc.php.gz /var/www/apc
sudo gzip -d /var/www/apc/apc.php.gz

```

apc disables internal login.

```php
sudo vi /var/www/apc/apc.php

defaults ('USE_AUTHENTION',1); // change the value of 1 to 0

```

The strange process of logging in after spraying server information even though an internal login already exists? So disable it.

Create .htaccess files and establish authentication system

```bash
sudo vi /var/www/apc/.htaccess

# Title that appears in the authentication window
AuthName "APC Authorization"

# Authentication method
AuthType Basic

# .htpasswd is not placed in a web-accessible path
AuthUserFile /home/unclepapa/.htpasswd

AuthGroupFile /dev/null
require valid-user

```

Grant .htaccess from apc directory

```undefined
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default

<Directory /var/www/apc>
AllowOverride All
</Directory>

```

The .htaccess file is licensed when the above syntax is added. The above /etc/apache2/sites-available/default is the Apache default site path, and the above syntax is added to the path of the site you want.

creating .htpasswd file

Use the -c option on initial creation, admin enter the desired user ID

```bash
htpasswd -c /home/unclepapa/.htpasswd admin

```

(User ID of the path to which the command will be first generated)

Type the above command and enter the password

```undefined
New password:
Re-type new password:
Adding password for user admin

```

When adding users to .htpasswd

```bash
'htpasswd /home/unclepapa/.htpasswd Username to add

```

Restart Apache

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart

```

### APC Settings

For apc setup options, visit http://php.net/manual/en/apc.configuration.php.

In Ubuntu, the apc setup file is located in/etc/php5/conf.d/apc.ini, so the values described below are set to the desired value and added.

The default value is 1, which apc watches and reloads when the php file is modified. Setting this value to 0 improves performance, but even if the php file is modified, it runs existing cached files without reflection, so the Apache must be restarted every time.

Sets the size of memory that stores cached results. As apc deletes older caches when cached memory is full, performance decreases as this number increases.

It is recommended to refer to the Cache full count and adjust it to the appropriate number, and the default value is 32M.

```undefined
apc.shm_size=128M

```

The default is 1M, the maximum size of a single file that apc can store as a cache.

```undefined
apc.max_file_size=5M

```

The default number of op-code quantities that apc can store is 1000.

```undefined
apc.num_files_hint=4000

```

The default number of data items that can be determined by apc is 4096.

```undefined
apc.user_entries_hint=10000

```

This value can be a problem if you are operating multiple websites using VirtualHost. Because the default value is 1 (On), it is applied to all websites, which causes a huge memory load. Set the value to 1 only on the website that needs it.

```undefined
apc.cache_by_default=0

```

1) First, set the value below to prevent apc from caching.

```undefined
sudo vi /etc/php5/conf.d/apc.ini

apc.cache_by_default=0

```

2) Create a .htaccess file in the Webroot folder and add the following information to the VirtualHost that you want to be cached.

```undefined
php_flag apc.cache_by_default On

```

Or add content as below to VirtualHost`s Apache settings that you want to cache

```undefined
12<IfModule mod_php5.c>
php_flag apc.cache_by_default On
</IfModule>

```

Conversely, by default, the contents of virtualhost`s website, which does not want APC to be cached while enabled, are modified as shown in "php_flag apc.cache_by_default Off".

### APC Performance Measurements

```bash
ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost/index.html

```

- -n (requests) : Number of requests sent to check performance
- -c (concurrent): Number of requests requested at the same time
- Site address where http:// is desired for measurement
