JS Function (JavaScript function)

JavaScript uses functions in various ways. Therefore, perfecting the function would be a must for JavaScript developers.

In other languages, JavaScript performs various tasks that are handled in separate grammar.

In this article, you will learn about the various methods of defining functions in JavaScript, function expressions, and function declarations, and how local effective ranges and variable hoisting work.

We then look at APIs that provide a better interface to the function, initialize using less global variables, and different patterns that help performance by avoiding unnecessary tasks.

### Background Knowledge

There are two important features that make the function of JavaScript special.

First, the function is a `first-class` object.

Second, the function provides a `scope`.

A function is an object that has the following characteristics:

- Runtime, i.e., can be dynamically generated during program execution.
- It can be assigned to variables, copied references to other variables, expanded, and deleted except in some special cases.
- It can be passed as a factor for another function and can be a return value for another function.
- You can have your own properties and methods.

Therefore, the following situations are possible:

Function A has a property and method as an object, one of which is another function, B. This function B takes the function C as a factor and returns another function D as a result of the execution.

When you first see this form, you can feel that there are many functions to manage. However, if you get used to various function application methods, you will appreciate the capabilities, flexibility, and expressiveness that the function provides.

Generally speaking, in JavaScript, a function is an object.

However, this object has a special function that can be invoked and executed.

The fact that a function is an object becomes apparent by looking at the behavior of the following `new Function()` constructors:

```js
'// Anti-Pattern
// for demo purposes only.
var add = new Function('a, b', 'return a + b');
returns add (1,2); // 3.
```

In this code, add() is self-evident because it was created through the constructor.

However, the use of `Function()` constructors is not as good as `eval(). This is because the code is passed to the string and evaluated.

Additionally, it is inconvenient to read and write because quotes need to be escaped and the function body needs to be indented to increase readability.

The second important function is that the function provides the effective range.

JavaScript does not have a valid range in the `Block {}` region. In other words, blocks do not create a valid range.

There is only a functional valid range.

Any variable is a region variable if defined as var within a function and cannot be referenced outside the function. If braces do not provide a region valid range, it means that even if a variable is defined as var within an if condition statement, for statement, or for statement, it does not become an if or for statement region variable.

This variable becomes a local variable only when there is a function that surrounds the block, and if there is no wrapped variable, it becomes a global variable.

### Term Organization

When talking about patterns, using the agreed exact name is as important as the code itself.

Therefore, let`s take a quick look at the terms associated with the code that defines the function.

Explore the following code:

```js
// Expression of a named function
var add = function add(a, b) {
return a + b;
};
```

This code is a function using a named function expression.

A function expression omitted by its name is called an unknown function expression. It`s simply called function expression, and it`s also widely used as an anonymous function.

Examples include:

```js
'// function expression (or anonymous function)
var add = function (a, b) {
return a + b;
};
```

Therefore, `function expression` is a broader meaning term, and `name function expression` is a specific term for a function that defines the name of the function expression.

If you omit the second add from the initial named function expression code and end with an unknown function expression, it does not affect the definition of the function or the call of the subsequent function.

The only difference is that the name property of the function object becomes an empty string. The name property is a language extension, not an ECMA standard, but is widely used in many execution environments.

And if you keep the second add, the add.name property has the value of the string `add`. The name property is useful when you use a debugger like Fireburg and when you call yourself recursively in a function.

If you don`t want to use it for this purpose, you can skip it.

Finally, there is a function declaration.

Function declarations are similar to the use of functions in other languages.

```js
function foo() {
// Function Body
}
```

Grammatically, if you do not assign the result of a function expression to a variable (these servers are called callback patterns), the naming function expression and the function declaration will look similar.

Sometimes there is no way to distinguish between a function declaration and a named function without looking at the context in which it is generated (this is covered later).

There are grammatical differences between the two depending on whether they have semicolons or not.

A function declaration does not require a semicolon, but is required for function expressions. Always add semicolons directly, even if the semicolon insertion device can paste semicolons automatically.

### Declaration vs. Expression: Name and Hoisting

So which of the function declarations or function expressions should we use?

The problem with this question will be solved unexpectedly easily, considering that a function declaration is not available in the syntax.

Consider the following example of passing a function object as a parameter or defining a method as an object literal:

```js
It transfers the function expression to the factor of the callMe function.
callMe(function(){
// This function is an anonymous function expression.
});

// passes the signature function expression as a factor in the callMe function.
callMe(function me() {
// This function is a named function expression called 'me'.
});

// store the function expression as a property of the object.
var myObject = {
say : function () {
// This function is a function expression.
}
};
```

Function declarations can only be written within the global effective range or within the body of another function, i.e. `Program Code`.

It cannot be assigned to a variable or property, nor can it be used to pass a function with a factor when calling a function.

So when can we use the function declaration?

In the following example, the functions foo(), bar(), and local() were all defined as function declaration patterns.

```js
// Global Validity Range
function foo() {
function local() {
// Region Validity Range
function bar() { }
return bar;
}
}
```

### Name Property of Function

When choosing a pattern that defines a function, you may also want to consider writing a name property that is read-only.

As mentioned earlier, the name property is not standard, but is available in many execution environments.

The function declaration and the nominal function expression define the name property. On the other hand, the value of the name property of the unknown function expression varies in some cases.

IE is undefined, and Firefox and WebKits are defined as empty strings.

```js
'function foo() { } // function declaration
var bar = function() { }; // function expression
var baz = function baz() { }; // nominal function expression

foo.name; // "foo"
bar.name; // ""
baz.name; // "baz"
```

The name property can be useful when debugging code from a fireburg or another debugger.

This is because the debugger can check the value of the name property and write it as a name tag when it needs to show errors within the function.

The name property is also used to recursively invoke itself within a function.

If these two cases are not the case, the unknown function expression is easier to write and simpler.

The reason why we prefer function expressions over function declarations is that they are a kind of object and are not any special language component, just like any other object.

### Hoisting functions

You may have judged that the operation of the function declaration and the nominal function expression is almost the same.

But it`s not exactly the same. There is a difference in the `hoisting` behavior.

As you already know, all variables are internally hoisted up to the top part of the function, no matter where they are declared in the body of the function.

The same way applies because the function is also an object that is eventually assigned to the variable.

Using function declarations makes it easy to generate errors because not only variable declarations are hosted, but also function definitions themselves.

Explore the following code:

```js
// Anti-pattern (used for clarification)

// Global Functions
function foo() {
console.log('global foo');
}
function bar() {
console.log('global bar');
}

function hoistMe() {
console.log(typeof foo); // "function"
console.log(typeof bar); // "undefined"

foo(); // "local foo"
bar(); // Uncaught TypeError : bar is not a function

// Function declaration:
// Both the variable 'foo' and the defined function are hosted.
function foo() {
console.log('local foo');
}

// Function expression:
// The variable 'bar' is hoisted, but the defined function is not hoisted.
var bar = function () {
console.log('local bar');
};
}

hoistMe();
```

As you can see, if you define foo and bar within the body of the hoistMe() function, the actual variables are pulled up regardless of where they are defined, overwriting the global variables foo and bar.

However, the region variable foo() is hoisted to the top even though defined later, while the definition of bar() is hoisted with the declaration without hoisting.

Therefore, it is in the undefined state until the definition of bar() is given, and therefore cannot be used as a function. Also, the declaration itself is hoisted, so it does not show the global bar() within the valid range chain.

Now, let`s wrap up the background knowledge and terminology needed for the function, and start with the callback pattern and look at the patterns associated with the function available in JavaScript.

### Callback Pattern

The function is an object. That is, you can pass a function to another function as a factor.

If you pass the introduceBugs() function as a factor in the writeCode() function, perhaps the writeCode() will run (or recall) introduceBugs() at some point.

At this point, introduceBugs() is called a callback function or simply a callback.

```js
function writeCode(callback) {
// Code for performing an action

callback();
// ...
}

function introduceBugs() {
// code for creating bugs
}
writeCode(introduceBugs);
```

Note the fact that introduceBugs() are passed without parentheses as a factor in writeCode().

When parentheses are placed, the function is executed, which does not add parentheses because it only passes the reference of the function and the execution will be called (executed) at a later appropriate time.

Callback Example

Take a look at it in an example. We will start without a callback at first and refactoring later.

Let`s say there is a general-purpose function that performs complex tasks and returns large datasets as a result.

This function is called in the same format as findNodes(), which navigates the DOM tree and returns an array of required elements.

```js
var findNodes = function () {
vari = 10000, // long loop
nodes = [], // array to store results
found; // node discovery results

while (i) {
i -= 1;
// This part contains the code to locate the node
nodes.push(found);
}
return nodes;
};
```

For general purpose writing, it is recommended that this function does not do anything to the actual element, but only returns an array of DOM nodes.

Leave the logic that modifies the node in a different function.

For example, create a function called hide(). This function hides the nodes on the page, as the name suggests.

```js
var hide = function (nodes) {
var i = 0, max = nodes.length;
for (; i < max; i += 1) {
nodes[i].style.display = 'none';
}
};

// execute the function.
hide(findNodes());
```

This implementation is inefficient because hide() must loop back to the array of nodes returned in findNodes().

If you choose and hide nodes right away in findNodes(), it will be more efficient without looping again. However, implementing logic to hide nodes within findNodes() will tarnish the meaning of the universal function due to the combination of discovery and revision logic.

You can use this callback pattern.

Delegate execution of logic hiding nodes to the callback function and pass this function to findNodes().

```js
Refactor '// findNodes() to get a callback.
var findNodes = function (callback) {
vari = 10000, // long loop
nodes = [], // array to store results
found; // node discovery results

// verify that the callback function can be called.
if (typeof callback !== 'function') {
callback = false;
}

while (i) {
i -= 1;
// This part contains the code to locate the node

// execute callback here.
if(callback) {
callback(found);
}

nodes.push(found);
}
return nodes;
};
```

This implementation is intuitive. FindNodes() includes only one action to verify that a callback function has been added, and if any, run.

Because callbacks can be omitted, refactored findNodes() can still be used the same way as before, and does not break code that relies on existing APIs.

The following callback makes the implementation of Hide() simpler without having to traverse nodes:

```js
'// Callback function
var hide = function (node) {
node.style.display = 'none';
};

// Find the node and hide it right away.
findNodes(hide);
```

In this example, you can use functions that already exist as callback functions, but you can also create and write anonymous functions when you call findNodes() functions.

For example, you can use the same general purpose fundNodes() function to show nodes as shown below.

```js
The anonymous function is passed to callback.
findNodes(function (node) {
node.style.display = 'none';
});
```

Callback and Validity

In the previous example, callback was executed in the following pattern:

```js
callback(parameters);
```

This code is simple and in most cases works well enough. However, callback is often a method of an object, not an anonymous or global one-time function.

If the callback method uses this to refer to the object to which it belongs, it may behave unexpectedly.

Suppose you use the paint(), a method of an object called myapp, as a callback.

```js
var myapp = {};
myapp.color = 'green';
myapp.paint = function (node) {
node.style.color= this.color
};

// findNodes() function behavior code
var findNodes = function (callback) {
// ...
if( typeof callback == 'function') {
callback(found);
}
// ...
}
```

Calling findNodes (myapp.paint) will not define this.color and will not work as expected.

Object this refers to a global object because findNodes() is a global function.

If findNodes() is a method of an object named dom, like dom.findNodes(), this inside the callback refers to a dom rather than myapp, contrary to expectations.

To solve this problem, we can pass along the callback function with the object to which the callback belongs.

```js
findNodes(myapp.paint, myapp);

// modify findNodes() to bind the forwarded object.
var findNodes = function (callback, callback_obj) {
// ...
if(typeof callback === 'function') {
callback.call(callback_obj, found)
}
// ...
};
```

Please refer to how to use the call method here.

Asynchronous event listener

The callback pattern is used in various ways on a daily basis.

For example, attaching an event listener to an element on a page is actually passing a pointer to the callback function that will be called when an event occurs.

The following example passes the console.log() callback function to the click event listener in the document.

```js
document.addEventListener('click', console.log, false);
```

Most client-side browser programming is event-driven.

Users generate various events on the page, such as click, keypress, mouseenter, mouseleave. JavaScript is suitable for event-driven programming because of its callback pattern, which allows programs to operate asynchronously and in other words at random.

Time Out

The other real-world examples of callback patterns are `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`, the timeout methods provided by the browser`s window object.

These methods also receive and execute callback functions.

```js
var thePlotThickens = function () {
console.log('500ms later...');
};
setTimeout(thePlotThickens, 500);
```

Please note that the PlotThickens was passed as variables without parentheses.

This function does not run immediately, but only passes pointers to the function so that setTimeout() can be called later.

Passing the string "thePlotThickens()" instead of function reference (pointer) is an anti-pattern similar to eval().

Callback in Library

Callback is a simple and powerful pattern that helps you design your library.

The code that will enter the Software Library must be as general-purpose and reusable as possible. Callback can help with this generalization.

You don`t need to anticipate and implement everything you can think of. This is because it only inflates the library unnecessarily and most users never need a mass of such large functions.

Instead, they can focus on key functions and provide a `hook` in the form of a callback.

The callback function makes it easier to create, expand, and refine library methods.

### Return Function

Because the function is an object, it can be used as a return value.

This means that the function does not necessarily have to return any data value or array as a result of its execution. You can return a more specialized function, or you can create a new function based on the value you enter.

Take a quick look at the example.

The function below creates a return value after a one-time initialization operation. The return value is a viable function.

```js
var setup = function () {
console.log(1);
return function () {
console.log(2);
};
};

// use setup function
1 of var my = setup(); // console.log(1) is output.
2 of my(); // console.log(2) is output.
```

setup() creates a closure because it encloses the returned function.

Closure can be used for storing private data because it is accessible from the returned function but not from outside the code.

An example is a counter that increases the value every time it is called.

```js
var setup = function () {
var count = 0;
return function () {
return (count += 1);
};
};

// How to Use
var nextCnt = setup();
return nextCnt(); // 1
return nextCnt(); // 2
return nextCnt(); // 3'
```

Functions that define themselves

Functions can be dynamically defined and assigned to variables.

If you create a new function and assign it to a variable that already has a different function, the new function will overwrite the previous function.

In a way, it is reused so that the previous function reference points to a new function.

You can also do this within the body of the previous function. In this case, the function overwrites itself with the new implementation and overrides it.

Let`s take a look at it in a simple examples.

```js
var scareMe = function () {
console.log('Boo!');
scareMe = function () {
console.log('Double Boo!!');
};
};

// use functions that define themselves
scareMe(); // Boo!
scareMe(); // Double Boo!!
```

This pattern can be useful if the function performs any initialization preparation only once.

Some of the functions are no longer useful because there is no reason to repeat unnecessary tasks. You can then override yourself to update your implementation.

Simply put, this pattern can definitely help application performance because the overridden function has less work.

The disadvantage of this pattern is that once you redefine yourself, you will not be able to find all the properties that you previously added to the original function.

Also, if a function is used under a different name, for example, assigned to another variable, or used as a method of an object, the body of the source function is executed, not the overridden part.

Consider an example of using the careMe() function as a first-class object:

- A new property will be added.
- A function object is assigned to a new variable.
- Functions are used as methods.

```js
var scareMe = function () {
console.log('Boo!');
scareMe = function () {
console.log('Double Boo!!');
};
};

// 1. Add a new property.
scareMe.property = 'property';

// 2. Assign a different name.
var prank = scareMe;

// 3. Use as a method.
var spooky = {
boo : scareMe
};

// Call me by a new name.
prank(); // Boo!
prank(); // Boo!
console.log(prank.property); // property

// Call by method.
spooky.boo(); // Boo!
spooky.boo(); // Boo!
console.log(spooky.boo.property);

// use functions that override themselves.
scareMe(); // Double Boo!!
scareMe(); // Double Boo!!
console.log(scareMe.property); // undefined
```

As you can see in the example, when a function is assigned to a new variable, it does not define itself unexpectedly.

Each time `prank() is called, `Bo!` is output in the console window. In addition, even though the global careMe() function was overwritten, prank() himself still refers to the previous definition, including the property property.

The same thing happens when a function is used as a bo() method of a spooky object. All of these calls continue to overwrite the global careMe() pointer.

Therefore, the updated body to output `Double Boo!!` is executed properly for the first time only when the global scareMe() is last called.

You will also no longer be able to refer to the careMe.property.

### Immediate Run Function

The immediate execution function pattern is a grammar that causes the function to be executed as soon as it is declared.

View the following example:

```js
(function(){
console.log('watch out!');
}());
```

This pattern is practically executed immediately after creating a function expression (whether named or unknown).

The term "immediate execution function" is not a term defined in the ECMAScript standard, but is short, simple, and useful for describing and discussing this pattern.

The instantaneous execution function pattern consists of the following parts:

- The function is declared as a function expression. (It does not work with functional declarations)
- Add parentheses at the end so that the function can be executed immediately.
- Enclose the entire function in parentheses. (required only if function is not assigned to variable)

The following alternative grammar is also commonly used, but JSLint prefers the initial pattern:

Please be aware of the position of the closing parenthesis.

```js
(function(){
console.log('watch out!');
})();
```

This pattern is useful in that it provides a valid range sandbox for the initialization code.

Consider the following general scenarios: After the page finishes loading, you must perform initial setup tasks, such as registering an event handler or creating objects.

You do not need to create a named function to reuse all of these operations because they run only once.

However, on the other hand, temporary variables are needed until the initialization phase is complete. Generating all these variables globally is a bad idea.

In this case, an immediate execution function will be required.

The Immediate Run function wraps all code around the local effective range and prevents any variables from leaking into the global effective range.

```js
(function(){

var days = ['Sun', 'Mon', 'tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat'],
today = new Date(),
msg = 'Today is ' + days[today.getDay()]
+ ', ' + today.getDate();

console.log(msg);

}()); // Today is Fri, 22
```

If this code was not immediately enclosed as an execution function, the days, today, and msg variables would become global variables and remain after the initialization code.

Parameters for the Immediate Run function

You can also pass factors to the immediate execution function.

View the following example:

```js
output result :
// Imet jaehee on Fri Jan 22 2016 15:07:12 GMT+0900 (Korea Standard Time)
(function(who, when){

console.log('I met ' + who + ' on ' + when);

}('jaehee', new Date()));
```

Typically, a global object is immediately passed to a factor in the execution function.

This allows you to access global objects without using windows within the immediate execution function.

This allows code to be common in non-browser execution environments.

```js
(function(global){
// refer to global object as 'global'
}(this));
```

Typically, it is not recommended to pass too many factors for the immediate execution function. It is because it is difficult to scroll between the top and bottom parts of the code continuously to understand the behavior of the code.

Return value of Immediate Run function

Similar to other functions, the immediate execution function can return a value and the returned value can be assigned to a variable.

```js
var result = (function(){
return 2 + 2;
}());
```

The same behavior can be implemented by omitting enclosed parentheses. This is because parentheses are not required when assigning the return value of the immediate execution function to a variable.

If you omit the first pair of sphincters, it becomes the form below.

```js
var result = function(){
return 2 + 2;
}();
```

This grammar is simpler but slightly misleading. If someone doesn`t notice the last () when reading the code, you might think that the result of this phrase refers to a function.

The fact result value refers to the return value of the immediate execution function, i.e. the number 4 in this case.

Another grammar with the same result is:

```js
var result = (function(){
return 2 + 2;
})();
```

This example returns an integer value that is the raw data type as a result of the execution of the Immediate execution function. In addition to the raw data values, any type of value is possible, and you can also return a new function.

You can also use the effective range of the Immediate Run function to store certain data private and access only from the returned internal function.

In the following example, the immediate execution function returns a function and this return value is assigned to a variable called getResult. This function returns a value called res that is pre-structured in the immediate execution function and stored in the closure.

```js
var getResult = (function () {
var res = 2 + 2;
return function () {
return res;
};
}());
```

You can also use the Immediate Run function to define object properties. Suppose that the property of an object does not change during the object`s life cycle, and that initially defining the value requires action for proper calculation.

If so, you can wrap this task as an immediate execution function and assign the return value of the immediate execution function as a property value.

Take a look at the following examples:

```js
var o = {
message : (function () {
var who = 'me',
what = 'call';
return what + ' ' + who;
}()),
getMsg : function () {
return this.message;
}
};

// How to Use
console.log(o.getMsg()); // call me
console.log(o.message); // call me
```

In this example, o.message is a string property, not a function, but a function is required to define a value. This function runs when the script loads to define the property.

Advantages and How to Use

The out-of-the-box function pattern is widely used. Allows you to do a significant amount of work without leaving a global variable.

You don`t have to worry that the temporary variable will disturb the global space because it will be a local variable of the function that calls itself to all declared variables.

You can also wrap individual functions into an independent module using an immediate execution function pattern.

Suppose the page is static and works well without JavaScript. In terms of incremental improvement, you would like to add some additional code to the page.

Wrap this code (or module or function) as an immediate execution function and verify that it works well when and when the code added to the page is present.

You can then add or remove more improvements, test them individually, disable them, and so on.

The following templates allow you to define features in units: If this is called a module,

```js
// module1 defined in module1.js
(function(){
// All module1 codes...
}());
```

You can also code other modules along this template. And when you post code to the actual site, you can decide which features are ready to be used and merge the corresponding files using the build script.

### Initialize object immediately

Another way to protect the global effective range from clutter is to have an immediate object initialization pattern similar to the previously mentioned immediate execution function pattern.

This pattern runs the init() method as soon as the object is created to use the object.

The init() function is implemented as a function that handles all initialization operations.

Immediately look at an example of an object initialization pattern.

```js
({
// Here you can define the set values (setting constants).
maxwidth : 600,
maxheight : 400,

// Utility methods can also be defined.
gimmeMax : function () {
return this.maxwidth + ' * ' + this.maxheight;
},

// Initialize
init : function () {
console.log(this.gimmeMax());
// create more initialization tasks.
// ...
}
}).init();
```

In terms of grammar, this pattern should be considered the same as a typical object generation using object literals.

The object literal is also wrapped in parentheses (group operators), which instructs the JavaScript engine to recognize the brace as an object literal rather than a code block.

It then immediately invokes the init() method following the closing parenthesis.

You can also enclose objects and init() calls in parentheses rather than just objects in parentheses.

In other words, it can be expressed in two ways:

```js
({...}).init();
({...}.init());
```

The advantages of this pattern are the same as the advantages of the immediate execution function pattern. You can protect the global namespace during a single initialization operation.

Compared to wrapping the code with an anonymous function, this pattern may seem to have more grammatical concerns.

However, if the initialization task is more complex (in fact, it is often the case), it will help to structure the entire initialization process.

For example, if you define private helper functions as properties of temporary objects, it is much easier to distinguish the immediate execution functions than writing them scattered around.

The disadvantage of this pattern is that most JavaScript compression tools may not be able to compress more effectively than immediate execution function patterns.

This is because from a compressor`s point of view, it is safe to keep private properties and methods from being renamed shorter.

The advanced mode of Google`s Closer compiler is shortening the property name of an object that is immediately initialized. If you use other compression tools, you will need to check to see if they support compression of the above patterns.

### The function is a class of first class (not only grammar but also value)

In JavaScript, the function is an object.

In other words, functions can be stored in variables, arrays, or objects.

It can also be passed to the function or returned from the function.

And because the function is an object, it also has properties.

These are the characteristics of a function as a first-class class in JavaScript.
