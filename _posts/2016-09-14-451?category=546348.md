### DRY Principles

DRY stands for Don`t Repeat Yourself.

It is also called DIE: Duplication is Evil.

These principles are as follows: "All knowledge must be unique in itself, not ambiguous, and represented authoritatively."

In general, most applications aim to automate repetitive tasks. (This is usually the case with computers.)

This principle must be maintained in all codes. The same is true of web applications.

The same code should not be repeated anywhere.

### Re-factorize the code.

Refactoring [refactoring] is not just about fixing it, but about refactoring techniques, so I just translated it as refactoring.] This refers to changing the code without changing the function of the code.

You can think of it as "clean up" for the purpose of improving readability and quality of the code.

Refactoring is not about catching bugs or adding functions.

I will probably refactory the code I wrote the day before. When the code is still vivid in my head.

After two months, the code still makes it easier to read and reuse.

This is the motto.

During the refactoring of "refactor, fix frequently," you will probably apply the "best way."

Short-Circuit Evaluation(SCE)

In many words, it is commonly referred to as the shortest-distance operation, which means that the results are no longer checked for what has already been produced.

In other words, I`m not going to check any more of the computational results.

Validation

Verifying that the input form has a valid value is called validation.

### CDN

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network, which refers to the simple way to deliver content to users.

This means that CDN places copies of files in multiple data centers around the world, delivering content to users faster while maintaining the same URL.

- A content delivery network (CDN) is a system that stores and provides data in a network with multiple nodes to efficiently deliver content.
- It has the advantage of avoiding content bottlenecks because it is connected directly to an Internet service provider and transmits data.

### Factor vs Parameter Differences

An argument refers to a value that is passed on the call of a function, and a parameter refers to a variable that accepts the passed factor.

The point here is that the factor is a value, and the parameter is literally a variable.

### RSS documents

RSS documents are standardized XML documents that make it easy to distribute and distribute web content, such as news.

### Request and Response

While it can be a confusing concept to think of requests and responses in terms, it is easier to think of it as a request and to send data as a result.

For example, ordering from a restaurant is a request, and the answer is serving food.

The most common request in a browser is to require information from a particular server through the address bar, and the response is to send the appropriate data.

Server-side programming refers to technologies that can create more user-friendly content when sending such responses, and this result is called a dynamic resource.

Conversely, data that everyone sees the same results anytime, anywhere is called static resources.

HTML, image files, media files, etc. usually belong here.

### The browser that became the Platform

The key to HTML5 conversion is to increase the functionality of your browser.

Because the browser already has significant functionality, it is simply a viewer who shows data, so let`s look at it as a platform, an environment in which the program can run.

To explain the platform easily, you can compare it to an operating system.

This means that, because there is an operating system called Windows, you can run a program like MS Office, and if you only provide the data you need for a platform called a browser, it works on top of a browser environment like an application.

In other words, HTML5`s core idea is to consider a created HTML page as a program and to consider the operating system in which it runs as a browser.

### Operating system compatibility and HTML5 specification

If an HTML page is considered a program, the types of browsers present can be compared to various operating systems.

Just as operating systems vary, such as Linux, Windows, Mac, and iOS, browsers include IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera.

Since the HTML page is a program, browsers running it now need to implement common features for compatibility, which is the specification of HTML5.

HTML5 requires the browser to implement the following key features:

- Offline features that can be run through HTML and resources stored in the browser without network connectivity.
- File Access features that read or write files from images or desktops in other domains
- Audio, video features that you can run without a media player
- CSS3 capability to run animation effects without flash
- Mobile features (media query) that allow HTML to be adapted to your mobile screen
- Storage capabilities that allow you to create and use databases within a browser
- WebSocket capability to send and receive string data in real time

For example, if your browser implements HTML5 specifications such as audio, video, and canvas features, you can simply specify which movie files will run on the HTML page, and the rest will be handled by these browsers.

The specification of HTML5, which started with the idea that the browser we talked about earlier becomes a platform and HTML pages become a program, creates a new term, Web App.

### JavaScript and Model-View-Controller (MVC)

JavaScript is a scripting language that allows simple actions on web pages, but as the role of the browser has grown, the importance of JavaScript has naturally increased.

As the scale grows, programming gradually develops a kind of guide or custom called design patterns or architectural patterns, one of which is MVC patterns.

MVC is, in an easy-to-use way, designed by dividing the areas that the program handles into screens, models, and controllers, and designing the entire structure through the interaction between them.

Therefore, functions are common patterns in various languages.

JavaScript, by comparison, has only been relatively screen-assisted in browsers, so it has not been noticed much until recently, but it is increasingly complex and rigorously designed with the development of other scripting languages.

To simply access the MVC pattern, it can be as follows.

- The role of the model corresponding to the data is treated as an HTML tag that the browser must handle.
- The role of a layout (View) in determining how pure data is displayed on the screen is treated as CSS.
- JavaScript the role of a controller that dynamically handles user judgment.

### Browser and JavaScript

In the Model-View-Controller structure, HTML handles the model, which is data, and CSS handles the View that makes up the screen, and finally JavaScript acts as a controller in a small world called a browser.

To help you understand JavaScript, consider where you used the word "Script" to help you understand it, and it will help you a little bit about how JavaScript works.

A script means a manuscript used in a movie or speech. (Original script means a play script.)

In other words, it is about how a speaker or actor should do in a certain scene.

The receiving the script, script he was watching the people to determine how to act will express that to interpretation (interpreter).

In this sense, the scripting languages have the same meaning as the script that directs the task.

If you think of JavaScript in this sense, it`s a statement of work that you ask a browser that expresses HTML documents.

Each browser has its own JavaScript interpreter, which is used to interpret JavaScript declared in HTML or processed as a link.

### Why should CSS be at the top of an HTML document?

Any programming has something called a coding convention.

HTML typically places the declaration of CSS at the top of an HTML document because the sooner CSS is used to provide the criteria for how the rendering engine handles the screen (see, cannot see, or use what color?), the easier it is to construct a render tree.

HTML that the browser receives is always processed in sequence from the top.

Therefore, if the rendering engine places a reference part at the top, the `selection criteria` on the screen can be seen in advance.

In fact, because the part where the rendering engine is working is the <body> tag on the screen, it is common to specify the CSS before the <body> tag appears unless it is special.

### Code Cohesibility

It means that the personality is clear to suit the original purpose of the code.

For example, an object that handles logic can be described as a highly cohesive code that handles logic only and an object that handles screen only.

### URI, URL, URN

URI stands for "Uniform Resource Identifier" and means of identifying various resources on the web.

The most common form of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL).

The URL is a form of URI and can be called a subset (category).

The URL consists of the protocols required to access the resource, the domain, the path to the file, and the name of the file to be accessed.

Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a method of finding Internet resources with names that have invariant meanings.

URN may look similar in some cases because it may be a URL. However, the URL needs to know the location of the resource, such as protocol, domain, etc., to find the resource.

It is different that URN can find resources only by the name of the resource.

### Compile

In order for a person to work on a computer, a common means of communication between a computer and a person is needed.

Unfortunately, however, computers do not understand what people say, and neither do they know the machine language that computers can recognize.

Therefore, we can communicate with each other by using interpreters in the middle so that people and computers can understand, and the role of these interpreters is called compilation.

### ASP(Active Server Page)

ASP is a server-based technology commonly used by web servers and created by Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), designed to create interactive HTML pages for WWW or intranet use.

### PHP(Personal HomePage Tools, Professional HyperText Preprocessor)

PHP was first invented by Rasmus Lerdoft in 1994 and has been used externally since early 1995.

PHP is a scripting language interpreted by the server, and similar languages include MS`s ASP.

These server-specific languages are interpreted by the server and the results are HTML-shaped and sent to the client (web browser), so you cannot see the internal source code.

PHP does not operate in specific areas like ASP, but is similar to the grammar of the C language, so it is easier for existing developers to access it and can be programmed with fewer commands.

However, there are also disadvantages of weak support functions such as component problems.

### Servlet : 서블릿(Servlet : Server + Applet)

Servlet is a technology announced by Sun that provides a technology for creating dynamic content based on Java language.

Servlets cannot be written easily because they are in almost the same format as Java.

In addition, the code is mixed with HTML code, which makes it less efficient in terms of separation of tasks.

### JSP(Java Server Pages)

By default, JSP is the same as Java Servlet.

JSP is a web-only scripting language, similar in grammar to PHP or ASP, but more powerful server-side language because it retains the power of Java.

JSP is based on Java, like servlets, and unlike servlets, it has Java code between HTML tags such as ASP and PHP.

JSP can create programs in script language format, and the custom tag feature, which allows users to define and use tags themselves, makes it easier to develop programs and organize websites efficiently.

### Environment variable

Information registered with the Windows operating system (value registered, variable named PATH)

### Server Side Scripts vs Client Side Scripts

The programming language is largely divided into the Client Side script language and the Server Side script language.

Typical client-side scripting languages include JavaScript, while server-side scripting languages include PHP, ASP, and JSP.

The difference between the two scripting languages is that for client-side scripting languages, programming is performed on the visitor`s computer, but for server-side scripting languages, programming is performed on the server.

Therefore, the site uses client-side language to develop a dynamic user experience, and the server-side scripting language is primarily used to retrieve stored data from server-side databases or to store data sent by visitors.

For example, suppose a site visitor entered an ID and password on the login form.

After completing the completion, before checking whether you are a registered member when you press the login button, you must first check that you have written the correct ID and password format.

You can use JavaScript or J-Query, the client-side language, because programming is performed on the visitor`s computer to check if it is in the correct ID and password format.

Then, if the ID and password were correctly written to the format, the action page, the Server Side Script page, sends the ID and password data entered by the visitor to check whether a matching ID and password exist in the database.

You can examine it and let the user know if it exists, and if it does not exist, you can tell the user the corresponding result.

### Differences between Web Server and Web Hosting

Web server and web hosting are both providing Web services to clients who are visitors.

Web servers, however, require expertise in web servers and a dedicated line to provide Web services, as you build your own servers on your computer.

Web hosting refers to a large number of users renting a small amount of storage space on an external computer where a server is already built.

In other words, renting a certain amount of storage space to an external server computer to provide services is called `web hosting`.

Therefore, it can be used without server expertise, but it has the disadvantage of having limited storage capacity.

### Scope of JavaScript

In JavaScript, the scope is also known as the context in which the code is executed (variable area, execution area, valid range, etc. In practice, the term scope is most commonly used) and is divided into global, regional, and eval scopes.

### Scope Chain

A function including a function creates an interconnected execution scope, which is called a `scope chain`.

Thus, JavaScript traces variables back to the search chain based on the scope`s hierarchy.

### What is a coding pattern?

A pattern means that in a broad sense, it can be a frame or model that can be used to make things with repeated events or objects.

Patterns in software development refer to solutions to common problems.

Rather than a code-type answer that can be copied and pasted right away, it`s more like a template that solves problems in some categories, such as best practices, abstractions for usage.

Identifying patterns is important for the following reasons.

- Patterns help us write better code without wasting time unnecessarily using proven execution methods.
- Turn provides a certain level of abstraction. There is a limit to the amount of information that the human brain can think of in a given time. Therefore, it is helpful to explain using self-completed components (patterns) to avoid worrying about low-level details when considering complex problems.
- Patterns also help communicate between developers and teams that fall far away and are not seen. Simply naming a particular coding technique or approach makes it easy to confirm that everyone is talking about the same thing. For example, it is easier to say (or think) "an immediate function" in terms of readability than "to wrap the function in parentheses and have it run right where it is defined by placing a different set of parentheses at the end."

### What is an Object in JavaScript?

Objects are actually very simple.

It has so many features that it might be special, but the object is just a collection of named properties, a list of key-value pairs (almost identical to associated arrays in other languages).

If the object`s property is a function (function object), this is called a method.

### Mixins

It`s about creating tools to help team cooperation work more smoothly.

In other words, mix-in helps eliminate code repetition and focus on the parts that need to be used.

Mix-in enables powerful abstraction and allows you to solve complex problems gracefully.

You do not necessarily need to create a mix-in for multiple components.

Mix-in makes it easy to describe an action or role and apply it to a component.

You can also reduce the code of the components. This can increase the readability of the code.

### Coding Convention

Markup development is closely related to design, browser, script, performance, accessibility, etc. because it forms the basic skeleton of the front-end page.

In other words, a good markup development is required to deliver content quickly and easily to users across all browsers without loss. The coding convention presents the standards that markup developers must follow to satisfy these conditions.

Furthermore, we present a unified coding scheme to minimize the cost invested in maintenance. The probability that the first person who wrote the code will maintain it to the end is very low.

Therefore, writing code so that non-first-time developers can understand it quickly and accurately plays a crucial role in reducing code maintenance costs and improving task efficiency.

At least one project`s markup code should be written according to the same coding convention.

Compliance with coding conventions also makes it easier to share code among project members and allows consistent code creation. It is not important to choose which coding convention, but to write source code on a unified basis.

### Template for programming

In programming, a template is a general class or unit raw code that can be used as a basis for a particular unit code.

In C++, an object-oriented programming language, there is a standardized library of templates that programmers simply need to select the individual template classes they want to modify.

The MFC library is a prime example.

### Query

A query is a request for information from a database.

A query is a processing by a web client request (usually a string-based request) to show specific information to a web server.

Queries are usually used to find specific topics or phrases from databases. The topic word is entered within the search field of the search engine, and the content is then passed to the web server.

### ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning)

ERP is called enterprise-wide resource management, and is an integrated information system that effectively manages all the human and physical resources in the enterprise that are being used for corporate activities and thus positively strengthens the company`s competitiveness.

Companies have multiple systems to perform management activities: production, sales, personnel, accounting, funding, cost, fixed assets, etc. ERP is a typical corporate reengineering technique to maximize productivity by rebuilding an integrated system across all sectors.

In the past, each Sub System for management support processes and processes information in the field to support decision-making, but operates as a separate system, causing inconvenience and waste as information is not connected to other sectors at the same time.

To address these challenges, ERP wants to ensure that data can be entered from one segment to the entire enterprise, simultaneously, and as needed, information.

The S/W supplied to realize ERP is called the ERP Package, a system that is automatically connected globally when data is entered from one system, enabling integrated operations that do not require separate interface processing.
