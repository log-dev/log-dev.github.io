CSS effect - Select Box

One of the most difficult form fields to customize is the Select Box.

Due to the design limitations of the native select box, it is not easy to solve by CSS alone.

Let`s take a look at alternative measures for this.

Due to the design limitations of the native select box, many plug-ins replace the structure of the select box with div and ul elements.

However, these plug-ins lack the IE support rate of the old version.

Additionally, plug-ins using the method of replacing div and ul elements will not be able to receive native support from each device on mobile and experience a very unpleasant user experience.

Below you will find out about CSS and the select box using simple JS without plug-in.

### Select CSS

In the domestic environment (philosophy of step-up enhancement), it is easier to change the appearance design of the select box in terms of pursuing an elegant degradation philosophy (modern browser).

The basic structure of select box is as follows.

Each native has different arrow shapes, so remove the arrow shapes to unify them into one.

The style of adding new arrows is as follows.

Make sure to change the design of the select box afterwards.

Since the design can only be changed in the form of select box, and it is not possible to change the option side, I recommend using plug-in related to select box if you want to change it until option.

The style of select box is as below.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="222" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/LGPboz?height=222&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=LGPboz&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_LGPboz"></iframe>

### Select box design using label

It is a design method using the label element and the parent element surrounding the select box.

The basic structure is to be written as follows.

> 1. Set the ID value of the select element and the 'for' property of the 'label' element to the same value. (Interaction)
2. Match the text of the 'option' element to the text of the 'label' element with the 'selected' attribute.

The CSS in the select box is as follows:

> 1. '.selectbox' is actually the part of the appearance and you can change the CSS in this section to the style you want.
2. The '.select:before' part indicates the arrow, but the background you want.You can set it up on selectbox' and remove the virtual selector.

When selecting the option of the select box, the changed option value is reflected in the label.

This reflects the text that the option has in the label, allowing the actual select element to behave, change, and implement the function as if the select`s option element were visible.

For better user accessibility (web accessibility), we will deal with focus in select box and blur if focus is lost.

In the select box, create a CSS effect that appears when focus is placed.

To give a focus effect, add .focus dynamically.

You can see the completed code in the following example: However, please test the focus effect at local.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="356" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/ZQzjpO?height=356&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=ZQzjpO&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_ZQzjpO"></iframe>

### IE7 Cross Browsing

In IE7, padding does not apply to select elements, so the above code applies up to IE8.

In order to support by IE7, we would like to change padding to applying parent element with select element.

However, the size of the select element does not change at this time, so the area where you can click the select box is smaller than the size of the entire box you see.

Another way is to specify the same size of high and line-height values for the parent element, label, select element without using padding from the beginning.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="266" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/BjBPMy?height=266&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=BjBPMy&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_BjBPMy"></iframe>
