Windows applications often store data and settings in the AppData folder. I didn`t notice it because I didn`t have access to the user account folder, but I had to back up the setup program of a particular program, so I looked at it because I noticed a complex structure.

### Introducing the AppData folder

AppData exists in each Windows user account and stores the data and settings of the application. This can only be seen if it displays hidden files (View > Check Hidden Items in the top menu of Windows Explorer).

AppData exists under the user account, allowing multiple users to save their own user-specific settings. This folder stands for Application Data, was introduced in Windows Vista and is currently in use until Windows 10.

`C:\Users\Username\AppData`

If you type `%APPDATA%` in the address bar of Windows Explorer, you can go to the `AppData\Roaming` folder.

AppData has three folders Local, LocalLow, and Roaming, which store different types of settings.

The Roaming folder, if your PC is connected to a domain with a roaming profile (a computer joined to a public domain), will have data between your computer and your computer that can roam to your account, such as Google, Firefox, etc., and save it there to move your bookmarks and other search data from your PC to your PC.

The Local folder stores specific data from a single computer. Logging in between domains will never synchronize between computers, where data typically contains data that must be unique or very large files (downloaded cache files and other large files).

Whether it is stored in the Roaming folder or in the Local folder is entirely up to the application developer.

If you are not connected to a domain, there is no real difference between the Roaming and Local folders, all of which are stored on your PC. However, application developers sometimes partition different types of data between different folders.

The LocalLow folder is the same as the Local folder, but is designed for "low intergrity" applications running with limited security settings. For example, Internet Explorer running in Protected Mode can only access the LocalLow folder.

Although it has little to do with personal use, some applications use this folder because they do not have access to the default Local folder.

If the program wants a single setup or set of files used by multiple users, the ProgramData folder should be used instead of the three folders above. The folder is located in `C:\ProgramData` (hidden file) and is known as AppData for all users in previous versions of Windows. For example, an antivirus program can maintain scan logs and settings in the ProgramData folder and share them with everyone on the PC.

The above-mentioned characteristics between folders are guidelines, but developers do not always comply with them. Some applications store settings in "C:\Users\User Account Name" or "C:\Users\User Account Name\Documents". It also stores data in registry and in any folder on the system.

### AppData Backup

Most Windows users are basically hidden because they don`t even need to know where the folder is. You do not need to back up this folder in its entirety, but if you need to restore it by including all folders in the backup, you must back up the entire folder.

However, if you want to save a file for a particular program or a computer game, you can find the program directory inside the AppData folder, copy the file to another location, and copy the folder to the same location on the new computer to use the same settings as before. Whether this behavior actually works depends on the program. Some programs store their settings in the registry or in a different location on the system.

It is recommended to use this method because many programs provide a way to synchronize or at least export data from one computer to another.
