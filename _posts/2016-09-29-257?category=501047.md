Detectizr is a Modernizr extension

Detectizr is a third-party library that serves as an extension of Modernizr.

Since Modernizer only checks new technologies and does not check the user`s operating system or browser, it is in charge of supplementing them.

In other words, Detectizr is a plug-in for Modernizr.

### What Detectizr does

- Device
- Device Model
- Screen Size
- Operating System (Operating System)
- Operating System Version
- Browser
- Browser Version
- Browser Engine
- Browser Plugins

It detects and checks the items above and provides information to the user.

These items are optional and can also be disabled if you do not want to detect them.

The following types of devices can be detected (detected):

- TV (including smart TVs and game consoles)
- Mobile (Mobile)
- Tablet
- Desktop

TV, mobile, and tablet device models are being detected as shown above.

### Detectizr Usage (how to use the detector)

The detector is a library that uses the Modernizer and can be configured as follows:

```undefined
<html>
<head>
<script src="modernizr.js"></script>
<script src="detectizr.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<script>
Detectizr.detect({detectScreen:false});
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

The caveat here is that you should load modernizr.js first.

In a way, it`s obvious, but since it`s an extended library of modernizers, we need to include detectizr.js after enclosing modernizr.js.

When you call the detector as shown above, you can see the information detected by the detector in the class name in the same way that the modernizer adds the class name to the `html` element and gives the user information.

The figure above shows the detection results of the detector as the class name of html.

### Detectizr Advantage

What are the advantages of using a detec-tizer?

The detecitizer makes it useful for projects that aim to improve step-by-step (gradual) capabilities.

If you need to consider IE8, you can control your browser more flexibly.

However, because IE6-7 is not detected, it is regrettable that we need a polyfill or custom script that can be detected separately.

Adding a checked script from IE6 to 7 eliminates the need to rely on conditional annotations, such as CSS Hack, used because of the IE family.

For example, a detector can add a class to the <html> element in the same class method that is commonly used in conditional annotations to provide information for users to use the class.

And for RWD, mobile, tablet, desktop class names are available.

The following code checks the IE family:

You will be able to use the above advantages if you use it with a detecitizer.

```js
/**
* --------------------------------
* IE Version Check
* http://e-rooms.tistory.com/
* --------------------------------
*/

(function () {

var UA = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();

// IE7 does not have the browser engine name Trident and IE11 does not have the string MSIE, so check both cases.
if (UA.indexOf('msie') != -1 || UA.indexOf('trident') != -1) {

var version = 11;
UA = /msie ([0-9]{1,}[\.0-9]{0,})/.exec(UA);
if (UA) {
version = parseInt(UA[1]);
}

var classNames = '';
// add html classes below IE 8.
// IE 9 and later are checked in detectizr.
if(version <= 8) {
It also adds a common class called //ie.
classNames += ' ie';
// add the current version display.
classNames += ' ie' + version;
}

// Add a multi-class for the lt-ie version in all IE.
for (var i = version + 1; i <= 11; i++) {
classNames += ' lt-ie' + i;
}

// Add the class checked in the code above to the html tag.
document.getElementsByTagName('html')[0].className += classNames;

}

})();
```

As a result of checking in IE7

You can control the class with conditional annotation statements as shown above.
