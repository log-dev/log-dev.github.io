We have put together how to set up a character set. Please set it with priority in mind.

### Character Set Priority

You can specify a character set in the Apache Web Server Setup file. However, if you specify a character set when writing HTML documents, etc., this value is prioritized over other values. The default character set can also be specified in the php setting.

### Setting up character sets on a server

You can add it to httpd.conf, which varies by Linux distribution.

```undefined
AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

```

In php.ini, modify as follows:

```undefined
[PHP]
default_charset = "UTF-8"
output_handler = mb_output_handler

[mbstring]
mbstring.language = UTF-8
mbstring.internal_encoding = UTF-8
mbstring.http_input = auto
mbstring.http_output = UTF-8
mbstring.encoding_translation = On
mbstring.detect_order = auto
mbstring.substitute_character = none;

[PHP_MBSTRING]
extension=php_mbstring.dll

```

Modify the my.cnf file.

```undefined
[client]
default-character-set = utf8

[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake=FALSE
init_connect="SET collation_connection = utf8_general_ci"
init_connect="SET NAMES utf8"
character-set-server = utf8
collation-server = utf8_general_ci

[mysqldump]
default-character-set = utf8

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8

```

### Setting up direct character sets when coding

The HTML file is made into UTF-8 and saved.

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">

```

The XML file is made into UTF-8 and saved.

```css
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>

```

# Specify at the top of the css file.

```css
@charset "utf-8";

```

Ignore the character set specified on the server.

```php
<?php header("Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8"); ?>

```

It is recognized regardless of the character set of HTML documents.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/file.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

```

### Context Examples

Source: https://lael.be/116

1. Do not set default language in httpd.conf in server settings

```undefined
# AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

```

2. Do not set default language in php.ini

```undefined
; default_charset = "iso-8859-1"
; default_charset = "utf-8"

```

3. Modify character set in my.cnf

```undefined
[client]
#password = your_password
default-character-set = utf8

[mysqld]
init_connect=SET collation_connection = utf8_general_ci
init_connect=SET NAMES utf8
default-character-set = utf8
character-set-server = utf8
collation-server = utf8_general_ci

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8

```

In the above state, both versions below can be operated.

- Gnubod4 UTF-8: Input/Output of Hangul is OK
- Gnubod4 EUC-KR: Normal output of Hangul (Hangeul is broken only in phpmyadmin)

If you specify `AddDefaultCharset UTF-8` in httpd.conf, use the following:

- The EUC-KR version is broken in Korean, but if you specify the encoding in the browser, it will output normally.
- Refreshing will break the Korean alphabet again
