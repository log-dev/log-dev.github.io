If you have downloaded Ubuntu iso files, you can burn them on CD/DVD or USB.

Burn to CD/DVD is the same as creating a typical bootable image, so skip it.

The operating system for creating the installation USB is based on Windows.

If you are using USB, use the tool recommended by Ubuntu.

It is a program for burning USB, also known as UUI. Let`s download it.

If you run the downloaded file and agree to I Agree, the program will run.

Use the drop-down menu in Step 1 to select the version of Ubuntu that you want to install.

ex. Ubuntu 12.04.2 Desktop amd64 - 64-bit desktop version.

ex. Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 amd-64 Installer - 64-bit server version.

Click Browse in Step 2 to retrieve the downloaded installation file.

It is not possible to select other than the version specified in Step 1 above.

Use the drop-down menu in Step 3 to select the USB drive.

If you want to format it because other data is stored on USB, check Format.

Click Create and select Yes (Y)
