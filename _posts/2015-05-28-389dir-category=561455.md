The most inconvenient thing about using Windows is using Explorer. Microsoft will get a lot of feedback, but why is it still stubborn?

### Clover Introduction

Clover is an extension of Windows Explorer that allows users to add multi-tap features similar to Chrome browsers. After the clover is installed, multiple folders can be opened in the same window and bookmarks can be added to the folder.

- Windows XP
- Windows 7
- Windows 8
- Windows 10

### Install Clover

Clover has not been updated for a while, and then it is being updated again. I also write down the pop-up that appears at the time of installation because it is not recognized because it is in the middle door: 2016-10-10

The latest clover is equipped with an update notification feature to obtain the user`s consent for installation in the event of an update. : 2016-10-20

Updates can be found on the update tab (in English) at the bottom of the Clover homepage.

> It was previously unknown, but after installing the latest version of Clover, it was discovered that an update notification was issued. The Windows you are using has not verified the publisher... A user account controller pop-up popped up asking whether to run clxxxdsp.exe, and it was an update to the clover.

Like a tab of the browsers you want to create fixed to and to the folder can do. If it is fixed, it can be automatically opened when you run the explorer, so keep the frequently opened and closed locations or folders you need to work on and increase the efficiency of your work.

Add a new tab as shown below.
