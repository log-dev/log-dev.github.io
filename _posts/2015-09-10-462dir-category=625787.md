Examine how to restrict access by modifying the source code directly.

### Restrict access to specific categories

Where intending to restrict non-logged users from accessing certain categories of writing:

```php
<?php
if ( !is_user_logged_in()
```

Inserting the above syntax into a single.php or an appropriate file may restrict guest users from accessing it. If you want to restrict access to all categories, you can use `is_category()`.

### Restrict access to specific pages

To restrict access to a specific page, `is_page()` is used.

```php
<?php
if ( !is_user_logged_in()
```

The parameters in is_page() allow you to enter the ID value of the page, the title of the page, and the slug of the page.

### Restrict access by member role

It can be applied as an access restriction code using the role provided by WordPress by default.

```php
if( current_user_can( 'administrator' ) ){}
if( current_user_can( 'editor' ) ){}
if( current_user_can( 'author' ) ){}
if( current_user_can( 'contributor' ) ){}
if( current_user_can( 'subscriber' ) ){}

```

One plug-in that extends the role is called the User Role Editor. You can create and apply the desired role using this plug-in.

```php
if( current_user_can( 'level_1' ) ){}
if( current_user_can( 'level_2' ) ){}
if( current_user_can( 'level_3' ) ){}

```
