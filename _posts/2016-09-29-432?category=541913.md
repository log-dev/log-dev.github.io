CSS3 Transforms

This posting explores the CSS3 transform property model, which allows you to transform elements in two or three dimensions of space.

Transformation means, in other words, changing the shape of a particular element in many ways.

- traslate : Moving effect
- scale : zoom effect
- Rotate : Rotation effect
- skew: Twisting effect

Typically, the transform effect is true when used in conjunction with the transition.

Here, we will use transition, which is a simple transition.

### translateX() translateY() 이동

The translate effect means moving based on the original location.

The important thing is that the original location information remains.

For example, look at the demo below, which moves the image 100px to the x-axis and 100px to the y-axis.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/vKvqEZ?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=vKvqEZ&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_vKvqEZ"></iframe>

What you have to watch carefully is the border that contains the original image.

There is a border where it is supposed to be, and the movement occurs after the specified offset.

Units use px, % and em.

You can also use the traslate() value with the x,y axis as a separator, and if there is only one value, it only represents transverse movement and considers that there is no longitudinal movement.

### Zoom in and out using scale() method

The scale() method is commonly used in image galleries, etc. because it zooms in and out of images.

For example, use the mouse for the effect of overloading the image.

Instead of just zooming in/out the image, applying it to a parent element zooms in/out all elements that have regions up to the child element, so you can also zoom in and out throughout the page.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="337" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/zByVkB?height=337&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=zByVkB&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_zByVkB"></iframe>

In the past, the width and height properties could be used only for images or specific areas to be resized and applied only for a single element.

This means that you could only apply it to one element, such as a particular image, but the scale() method differs in that you can apply the same effect to all the elements inside.

The scale() method has a value of 1.0 of its original size and can be specified in magnifications such as 0.5, 1.5.

### Rotation with rotate() method

The rotate() method can be specified using an angle (deg).

It is easy to use because it is a clockwise rotation.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="357" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/NAZkgm?height=357&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=NAZkgm&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_NAZkgm"></iframe>

If the angle of rotation is positive, it will rotate clockwise; if it is negative, it will rotate counterclockwise.

### Mixing effects

You can combine the effects of translate and rotate into one.

You can create spaces side by side with separators as shown in Demo below.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="391" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/mEakqj?height=391&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=mEakqj&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_mEakqj"></iframe>

Because it is interpreted from the left, it will move 100px to the right and shrink to the top (negative -100) to the size of 100px, half (0.5) and tilt 45 degrees.

### Skew() method to twist (distortion)

For the `skew()` method, give an angle relative to the x-axis and y-axis to deform the shape.

You can write it like skew (x-axis angle, y-axis angle), or you can use it separately, such as `skewx()` and `skewy().

When you first run skew, there is a slight difference between what you see with your eyes and what you expect, so you may need to practice.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="690" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/RREzJB?height=690&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=RREzJB&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_RREzJB"></iframe>

Let me briefly explain the principle of twisting.

Imagine that there is one skeleton along the x-axis and y-axis of an element.

If you twist it horizontally, the x-axis stays still and the y-axis rotates at a slanted angle.

In other words, specifying skewX() causes the y-axis to rotate.

If the value is positive, it will rotate counterclockwise (twist) and if the value is negative, it will rotate clockwise (twist).

In the example `skewX (15deg)` above, if you twist it horizontally, the x-axis (line x) is still fixed and the y-axis (line y) is rotated counterclockwise, making the box look tilted as shown above.

In the case of `skewY (15deg), the x-axis rotates as much as it is given, i.e., twisting in the longitudinal direction causes the y-axis (line on line y) to be fixed and the x-axis (line on line x) to rotate counterclockwise, making it look tilted as above.

If it`s hard to understand the above, you can understand as follows.

Please refer to the following picture.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2479CC3E57B1282523)

The first one in the figure above is the application of only `skewX (15deg)` and the x-ray is fixed and tilted 15deg relative to the y-axis.

The reference point for twisting using skew until now was the center of the box.

If you use a positive value for skewX() when the reference point is centered, the upper side of the element moves to the left, the lower side moves to the right, and the negative side is the opposite.

But when this reference point is different, it works differently.

For example, if you move the reference point to the bottom of the element, the lower side will only tilt to the right, while it is fixed.
