OPACITY

CSS3 has two properties that control transparency.

Let`s take a look at the differences in applying these attributes with the opacity and rgba properties.

### opacity property

This property is a property that controls the degree of transparency of elements, such as using graphic tools such as Photoshop.

The picture above is the result of applying it using opacity.

Whether you use text and images together or background color and text, the result will be almost the same as above.

In fact, applying opacity to the parent element also inherits all of the child nodes and encounters an issue where the background and text cannot be separated because the opacity cannot be turned off (removed) only from the child nodes.

Some of the solutions to this problem may be to bypass text yosho by using absolute to position the opcity outside of the inherited element, but it may not be a neat way to solve this problem.

Because of this problem, as you can see in the picture above, it`s common to write in legibility without lowering the opacity to readability.

To avoid the above problems, you can use the rgba attribute to solve them.

However, this is still insufficient in our country`s pursuit of step-by-step improvement.

As you can see in the table above, we need to cross-browse due to IE.

Of course, a project with an elegant dysfunctional philosophy would not be considered under IE8, but it is not feasible in reality.

Rather than criticizing this reality, we ask Google God for help for the peckish client.

The opacity can be similarly implemented using the filter property for cross-browsing of IE versions.

The filter value has values from 0 to 100, and the opacity has values from 0 to 1.

The higher the number, the closer the source and the lower the number, the greater the transparency.

### RGBA property

Among rgba, rgb is the color information value and a is the alpha value.

As you can see in the table above, IE6-8 is not supported, so we also use gradient among filter properties to find alternative ways.

### Usage filter for modern-brower

The rgba property can be used separately because it can be directly assigned to a property that requires color information.

This value, like the opacity, has a value between 0 and 1 and allows you to declare a background value, such as #ffffff, for browsers that do not support rgba.

As you can see from the picture above, the difference between the opacity and alpha properties is whether they affect the child nodes.

As mentioned above, opcity also affects children, so there is an error in separating text and images, but alpha values do not affect child nodes, so you can separate text, images, and background colors.

> background: transparent is applied because if a different background color is set in advance, it may conflict with the filter method.
zoom: 1 adds the element to which the filter is applied because the element must have a layout, but the inline element does not have a layout due to the nature of IE.
Most importantly, the startColorstr value and endColorstr value of the filter property should be noted that it is used as a 4byteHex value rather than as a traditional 3byteHex value.
Also, the first two letters specify the Alpha value, but it is the argb type, not rgba, and it applies the hexadecimal value.
