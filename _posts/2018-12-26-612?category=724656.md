## Interactive elements

Let`s learn how to use the elements `details`, `summary`, and `dialog`.

This Interactive element is an element that interacts with (interactive) users.

### details element

This details element hides information with the disk closure widget (Note: https://goo.gl/uznvFY), or expands to show it.
It can be used to reduce the complexity of the screen because it can be made public according to your needs without disclosing all the information at once. It works similarly to the Accordion component and, for your information, is not suitable for footnotes.

### summary element

The `summary` element can be used to display the label/caption (title) or the summit (summary) of the `details` element.
This element is similar to what `legend` displays the title of the `fieldset` element in the form.

Examples of use are as follows:

```undefined
<section class="progress window">
<h1>"Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams" 파일 복사</h1>
<details>
Copying <summary>... <progress max="375505392" value="97543282"></progress> 25%</summary>
<dl>
<dt>Transmission rate per second:</dt>
<dd>452KB/s</dd>
<dt>local file name:</dt>
<dd>/home/rpausch/raycd.m4v</dd>
<dt>Remote filename:</dt>
<dd>/var/www/lectures/raycd.m4v</dd>
<dt>Playtime:</dt>
<dd>01:16:27</dd>
<dt>color profile:</dt>
<dd>SD (6-1-6)</dd>
<dt>image size (width × height):</dt>
<dd>640×480</dd>
</dl>
</details>
</section>
```

- open - When loading a page, the widget is set to be displayed spread out, and if there is no open, it is displayed hidden by default.

### dialog element

Dialog (Note: https://goo.gl/pQ7gSX) is a component that requires your decision or information to be entered.
In other terms, it is also called `modal window` or `dialog box` or `layer pop-up` in Korea.

```undefined
<div class="box">
<dialog open>
<section>
<h2>Conversation title</h2>
</section>
This is the content of the <p> dialog box.</p>
<button type="submit">confirm</button>
</dialog>
</div>
```

By default, if you do not use the `open` property, it will not be displayed in the browser, so you must use the open property to display it on the screen.

## User Interaction Properties

Let`s take a look at the attributes that make you interact with users.

All HTML elements can have hidden properties, and when set to an element, they are not yet directly related to the current state of the page, or are used to declare that content is reused in other parts of the page.
The browser does not render elements with hidden properties set to the screen. This means that the elements whose properties are defined are hidden from the screen.

### tabindex properties

The tabindex can be enabled to navigate to the keyboard, excluded, or sequentially.
This is very important from an accessibility perspective.
For example, when a user who cannot use the mouse uses a keyboard keyboard keyboard to use a web page (service), the term "tab" usually refers to moving between Focusable elements using sequential (pre-determined) focus navigation.

Focusable elements by default (Note: https://allyjs.io/data-tables/focusable.html)

- Form control elements: input, button, textarea, select, etc.
- Elements with href properties: a, area
- Elements with controls property: video, audio

```undefined
'<!--Example of use -->
<!--
Sets the [positive] tab focus order (2nd).
(Not recommended for use as it interferes with logical focus flow)
-->
<button type="button" class="button is-play" tabindex="2">재생</button>


<!--
[0] can enable focus on non-focus elements.
The div element is a non-focus element, but the focus becomes applicable.
Useful when non-focus elements need to be focused when building components.
-->
<div tabindex="0"></div>


<!--
[-1] It can be excluded from the general focus order.
(Focusable with JavaScript programming)
After you temporarily exclude some elements of the component from the focus sequence,
Depending on the goal, the focus can be reactivated.
That is, you intentionally made it out of focus.
It can be useful when giving focus.
-->
<ol class="toc">
<li><a href="#pinch">위기</a></li>
<li><a href="#overcome" tabindex="-1">극복</a></li>
</ol>
```

### accesskey properties

The accesskey property lets you link actions through shortcuts.
That is, specifying a shortcut. All HTML elements can have accesskey attributes, which are set to keyboard shortcuts. However, the accelerator of the accesskey property relies on the browser and operating system platform, which varies from operating system to operating system.
Simply put, shortcuts used by Windows users and Mac OS X users vary. (Like the iPhone and Android user experience are different)

[Browser × Operating System Platform]

```undefined
# Windows
Chrome : Alt + Shortcuts
IE : Alt + Shortcuts
Safari : Alt + Shortcuts
Opera : Alt + Shortcuts
Firefox : Alt + Shift + Shortcut

# Mac OSX
Chrome : Control + Alt + Shortcuts
Safari : Control + Alt + Shortcuts
Opera : Control + Alt + Shortcuts
Firefox : Control + Shortcuts

# Linux
Chrome : Alt + Shortcuts
Opera : Alt + Shortcuts
Firefox : Alt + Shift + Shortcut
```

### contenteditable 속성

By default, HTML elements are not editable, but elements with contentable properties can be made user-editable.
If the value is true or empty string (""), edit is allowed; if the value is false, edit is not allowed.
For example, you can allow users to modify content in any widget when they want to give them permission to modify it.

### draggable properties

All HTML elements can have draggable properties.
Drag is possible if the value is true, or drag is not possible if the value is false or empty string ("").

```undefined
'<!--Example of use -->
<p draggable="true">
...
</p>
```

## Metadata Elements

Metadata refers to the data elements that provide information that are defined within the `head`.
A tag that describes the `meta`, that is, the document itself, is called a meta tag.

These elements include `head` and `title`, `meta`, `link`, `style`, and `base`.

### head element

The head element is an element that can provide general information (metadata) about a document that contains a document`s title and style sheet, script link, or declaration. Most browsers automatically generate a head element when the head element is omitted from the markup, but some do not.

Browser environment that does not automatically create `<head>` elements

- Android <= 1.6
- iPhone <= 3.1.3
- Opera <= 9.27
- Safari <= 3.2.1.
- Nokia 90

### Title element

The title defines the title of the document that is shown in the title bar or page tab of the browser, can only contain text, and if the tag is included, it is not interpreted and rendered as the string.

### meta element

The meta element can be used to define metadata that cannot be represented by other meta elements (`<title>, `base>, `link>, and `style>.

The types of metadata can be divided into three main types and are as follows.

When charset is set

The charset declaration, that is, the character encoding (charset) used in a series of formats for creating web pages.
Note that the element`s lang property takes precedence over this property, i.e. overwritten. 예: `<div lang="fr">`)

The http-equiv(alent) property is set.

Use the directives (pragma) to provide information about how web pages typically provided by a web server should be provided.

- HTML 5 no longer recommends that it be used as below.
`<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">`
- After 3 seconds, you will go to the page set in url value.
`<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3;url=https://google.com">`

```undefined
"<!-- Recommended X -->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">

<!-- Recommended ○ -->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

The last time the name property is set.

Defines the name of the document-level metadata and can be set using the content property value.

There are the following name values:

- application name: Define the name of the Web application running on the web page.
Simple web pages should not define an application-name meta.
- description : Set a short, accurate summary of the content of the web page.
- keywords : Set keywords related to the content of the page with comma-separated strings.
- author : Define the name of the document author.
- robots : definition of the behavior of the search robot crawling web pages.

£meta name="robots" content="index"!-- Allows you to index the contents of a page. -->

£meta name="viewport" content="width="!--"By default, mobile displays 960" if no value -->
```

### link element

It is used to specify the relationship (relation) between the current document and external resources (css or JavaScript), and this link element is most commonly used to link stylesheets.

Properties include the following:

- rel : Specify the relationship with the document.
- type : Define linked resource MIME types.
(기본 적용: text/css) text/html; text/javascript

Alternative Style Sheet Settings: You can select the style sheet to use in the View > Page Style menu. (Chrome corresponds to X)
Firefox allows you to select a style from the document style in the View menu.
-->

<link href="fancy.css" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="팬시">
<link href="basic.css" rel="alternate stylesheet" title="베이직">
```

### style element

The style element contains style information about a document or part of a document, and by default the CSS language is used.

The properties of this element include type, media, scoped, title, and disabled.

```undefined
"<!-- Examples of common use -->
<style type="text/css">
body {
color: #323232;
}
</style>

<!-- Example of using scoped property: £ No browser currently supports -->
<section>
<style scoped>
p { color: #902c1f; }
</style>
<p> ... </p>
</section>
```

### base element

The base element represents the reference URL of all relative URLs contained in the document, and only one `<base>` element must exist in one document.

```undefined
<base target="_blank" href="http://www.example.com/">
```

## The order in which the browser interprets HTML

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Title</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="sample.css">
<script src="example.js"></script>
</head>
