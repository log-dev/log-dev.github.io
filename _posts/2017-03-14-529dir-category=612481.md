### Adobe Affiliate Program Epilogue

> Like Google AdSense, it is very pleasing to be able to expect advertising revenue. However, as Google AdSense started like that, I think it can complain of difficulties in signing up and installing banners due to the lack of support for Hangeul. It seems that users who are looking for high profits through advertising programs will be able to install them without any burden.
