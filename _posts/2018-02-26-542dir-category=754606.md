Create some tips on WSL management and useful tools.

### Update WSL Distribution Package

It varies from distribution to distribution, but Ubuntu users can update and upgrade as follows. If you installed it for the first time, let`s do it at least once.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### View WSL Distribution Information

Ubuntu users can obtain distribution-related information with the command below.

```bash
$ lsb_release -a

No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description: Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
Release: 16.04
Codename: xenial
```

If you want more detailed information and a screen attached to the distribution logo, try installing screenFetch.

If you are a Ubuntu user, you can install it as below. For other users, stop by Repo above and refer to the installation method.

```bash
$ sudo apt install screenfetch
```

The execution screen is as follows.

```bash
$ screenfetch
```

### Running and mounting CMD or PowerShell from a directory location

To open Powershell from the current directory location, you can access the Windows Explorer `File` menu. For CMD, you can type `cmd` in the directory path section of Windows Explorer and press Enter.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/994820455A896AF70F)

Powershell or CMD automatically recognizes the current path as shown below, and if `bash` is entered in this state, the drive is automatically mounted on WSL.

The WSL console allows users to mount the drive they want, such as `/mnt/drive letter` and also allows access to subdirectories such as `/mnt/drive letter/directory name`. If `cd/mnt/c` is entered, it can be moved to the drive (directory) at the same time as mount.

### Using Windows Files in WSL

When Windows files need to be accessed by Linux applications, they can be accessed such as `/mnt/c/Users/Windows Username/Documents/Projects/File Name`. However, not all Linux applications can access files using `/mnt`.

This problem can be solved by using symbolic links, and if the Windows directory is the same as "C:\Users\Windows Username\Documents\Projects", the symbolic links can be established and accessed to the desired Linux directory as shown below.

```bash
'$ln -s "/mnt/c/Users/Windows Username/Documents/Projects" /home/Linux Username/Projects'
```

### Change Console (Terminal) Color and Font

Refer to Terminal (CMD, WSL) color set change - WSL for reference.

### Connecting to the Hosting Server in the WSL

Web hosts that are serviced these days are often supported with ssh access. This is also supported by cafe24 which is widely used by many people.

- Access cafe24 from the web to your account
- My service managed hosting > > Security Management > ftp and moved to the setting up access shell shell Change connection settings to acceptance.
- Run WSL and connect to `ssh own hosting ID@hosting address`. If you have a domain, you can connect it to a domain, or you can connect it to `Hosting ID.cafe24.com`.
BASH
`$ ssh uzugoer@uzuro.com`
- On the first connection, ask for a connection, type yes, and enter the FTP connection password for the password. Let`s try typing the basic commands.
BASH
`The authenticity of host `uzuro.com (183.111.174.88)` can`t be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:XM0Bu/blKrwAlXR6oy8MF6FSRTj8PJGRJD3FyHeILmk.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

Warning: Permanently added `uzuro.com` (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
