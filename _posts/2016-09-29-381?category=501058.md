Value type and reference type and JavaScript program execution stage

In this posting, you will have time to learn about the value type, reference type, and JavaScript program execution steps in the data type.

### Data of value type and data of reference type

Assigning data to a variable is to use that value again later.

Learn how the program code will use the value assigned to the variable space again.

```js
a.num = 3;
b = "3";
c = a.num + b;
```

Let`s say you met the sentence `c = a.num + b;` while running the program.

JavaScript will first find the final value of the left and right operand used for + operation.

If you browse to the value of a.num, you will find num among the attributes that a has because of the "." operator.

So you will use that value as the left-hand value of the + operator.

During this operation, JavaScript must be able to determine whether the value in the space of the variable should be used as the final value (for b) or as a reference to other memory (for a).

This means that the data in the variable must be either a value type or a reference type.

The value type data provided by JavaScript has a number, string, boolean, and a little specifically "undefined" and "no objects".

Except for this value type data, all types provided by JavaScript and defined by the user are reference type data.

Enter JavaScript again and return to the process of retrieving the final value of the variable used in the third expression of the code above.

JavaScript first determines whether a and b used in the operation are value type variables or reference type variables.

So I moved to the memory reference point and the reference value is the type that judgment is a. to find that num

If you find num, you will know that it is a value type data, and you will return the value that num has.

b is determined to be a value type of data and returns the data stored in b immediately.

The two returned values will be used for the + operation.

JavaScript indicates that the two types of data used for + operations are numbers on the left and strings on the right.

This translates the number 3 into a string according to the conversion rules between the types that JavaScript has.

This results in the following operations:

```js
c = "3" + "3";
```

JavaScript engine a.In the figure, the procedure for finding the final value of num, b is as follows.

a.num, b. Search procedure

The procedure described above is a procedure that finds and uses the final value of a variable in JavaScript.

In the weak type scheme used by JavaScript, it is not known in advance whether num is a member of an object or not.

A point physically move to where to go there if they are running the program is time to get to know a member of the num run time and I am.

In comparison, in a strong type language, the type of variable is determined when compiled.

This means that the data structure of a variable can be identified before it is executed.

When you compile, you can see if num is a member of a if you understand the structure of an object.

Therefore, using a member such as num2 that is not in a compilation stage can show the developers the compilation error before runtime.

The fact that the process of retrieving variable values from JavaScript is carried out during the execution phase can be seen as a basis for the theory that var variables can accept any type of data.

For this reason, JavaScript does not have an error when looking up a member that is not in the object, but it can be seen only when it is actually executed.

In fact, all members of JavaScript objects are var variables.

The terms attribute and method are terms related to object orientation and only provide convenience for people`s communication.

The JavaScript engine does not distinguish attributes, methods, or variables.

All you need to do is distinguish between the value type and the reference type as var variables.

For example, suppose you have a user-defined type, Person, that includes name, setName as a member.

Then try creating an instance.

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
this.setName = function () {
return this.name;
}
}

var mySon = new person ('Hong Gil-dong'); // create instance and pass string (value type)
console.log (mySon.setName()); // function call'
```

The name property of mySon instance is a variable of the value type and the setName method is a variable of the reference type.

You can also see at runtime that the variable setName is a variable of the reference type pointing to the function.

That is, when JavaScript encounters this code, it first moves to where setName points and then executes the execution code block defined in that location because of the operator "().

If there is no code block, an error occurs.

### Program Execution Steps

The process by which an instance is created in memory differs slightly from the typical powerful type of language and JavaScript.

This slight difference can lead to incomprehensible situations in terms of general language (C#, java, etc.), and sometimes trying to understand JavaScript code based on general language can cause difficulties in debugging.

JavaScript Program Execution Procedure

When you start a JavaScript program, the program does not run immediately, but goes through parsing at the global level of the program.

Parsing at the global level refers to creating a variable equal to the name of the function and a named function that is not included in any function and initializing it as a reference to the function containing the execution code.

We will name `variables with the same name as the function name` as the function variable in the function variable.

After the parsing phase, the program runs, and if you encounter a function call while running the program, repeat the parsing phase of that function level.

In other words, it is not until you define the local variables and function variables of the function in the code of the function that you execute the function code.

Each time you encounter a function call, these parsing and function execution are repeated and the program runs through.

More precisely, variables and function variables defined at the global level of parsing are in fact added as members of the Window object if the root object, i.e. the environment in which the program runs in a Web browser.

The parsing at the function level adds as a member of an object called the variable scope associated with that function.

In fact, the root object is also a top-level variable scope object.

It may be difficult to understand what it means to be "added as a member of an object", but one thing to know is that every variable belongs to it, whether it is a var variable or a function variable.

If a program has var variables and functions that do not belong to any function, they belong to the root object during the runtime, and the variables that belong to the function and internal functions belong to the variable scope object associated with the function.

Use the following simple example code to learn what happens during the parsing phase.

```js
// During parsing, variable x is defined as undefined in memory
// Zero allocated at runtime
var x = 0;
// The parsing phase defines the variable add and assigns a reference to the function's code block ({}).
// Function implementation code is not executed during parsing phase
function add(a, b) {
// At runtime, a + b value is assigned to the local variable c in this code block
var c = a + b;
return c;
}

```

JavaScript defines x and add in the code while parsing the above code.

The global variable x is initialized as undefined and the add variable (function variable) is initialized as a reference to the function containing the execution code.

When the parsing phase is completed and the runtime is completed, the statements you have created using previously defined variables and functions are executed.

Now we`re going to look at the following code:

```js
console.log(square(4)); // 16 출력
var square = 0; // overwrites the defined square variable at runtime when parsing.
function square(x) { // function definition
return x * x;
}
console.log(square); // 0 출력
```

When you plot the above process, it runs in the following procedure:

JavaScript Program Execution Stage

When you run the code, the parsing phase defines the global variables square and the function square.

The square variable is defined first, and then the square function is defined, overwriting the square variable.

JavaScript does not separate variables from functions when defining variables square and function square in memory.

The same place you manage is overwritten if the name is the same.

So finally, only square that points to the function remains.

This is what happens during the parsing phase.

Now you will learn how the code runs.

square refers to the code block that is defining the function and is outputted by running `console.log(square(4));`.

However, in the next sentence, `var square = 0;`, zero is assigned to the memory that square is pointing to.

Therefore, the last sentence, `console.log(square),` will output zero.

JavaScript does not manage variables separately from functions. Whether you assign a function to a variable or a variable to a function, this is normal.

Therefore, you will need to write code with caution because the content of the functions and variables can be changed by other functions and variables at any time when compiling.

Of course, you can avoid this problem by specifying a namespace to create code.

We`ll cover the namespaces next time.
