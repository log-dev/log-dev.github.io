Operator

Operators used in JavaScript programming include arithmetic, character combination (complex college entrance), increasing and decreasing, comparing, logic, and trinomial conditions.

For example, you add all your credits to get a total score and an average, and in this case, you use the arithmetic operator.

This series of operations, such as subtraction, addition, multiplication, division, and comparison, are called computational operations.

### Arithmetic Operators

The arithmetic operators include +, -, *, /, and % learned in arithmetic time.

The operation requires two operands, i.e. two operands.

This is called a binary operator, and the following table shows the type and type of arithmetic operators:

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

```js
var num1 = 10,
num2 = 5,
result;

result = num1 + num2;
console.log(result);

result = num1 - num2;
console.log(result);

result = num1 * num2;
console.log(result);

result = num1 / num2;
console.log(result);

result = num1 % num2;
console.log(result);
```

```js
'vara = "JavaScript";
var b = 'Programming Fundamentals';

var sum = a + b;
console.log(sum);

var c = 20;
var d = '10';
var sum2 = c + d; // add numbers and strings to form a string bond.
console.log(sum2);
```

### University entrance operator

The alternative operator (=) is used to finally store the computed data in a variable.

Complex substitution operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=) are a combination of arithmetic and substitution operators.

The following table shows the types of university entrance operators.

```js
var n1 = 30;
var n2 = 10;
console.log(n1 += n2); // n1 = n1 + n2
console.log(n1 -= n2); // n1 = n1 - n2
console.log(n1 *= n2); // n1 = n1 * n2
console.log(n1 /= n2); // n1 = n1 / n2
```

### Comparison Operators

Operator used to compare two data, such as "large, small, equal".

The value of the computed result returns logical data as true or false.

The type of comparison operator that follows:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| | |

```js
/**
* ==============================+
* Comparison operator
* ==============================+
*/

var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var c = 10;
var d = '20';
var val;

val = a > b;
console.log(val);

val = a < b;
console.log(val);

val = a <= b;
console.log(val);

val = a != c;
console.log(val);

val = b == d;
console.log(val);
```

### Logical operators

The logical operator is ||(or),

The logical operator returns the result with the operand as logical data, `true` or `false`.

The ||(or) operator returns a result called `true` even if only one of the operands has `true`.

but

!(not) is a logical negative operator and returns the opposite result of `false` if the operand is `true`.

The types of logical connections are as follows:

a conditional sentence

A condition statement is a control of the flow of programming, calculating whether a particular condition is met, and setting the program syntax to be performed if the condition is met.

You can also set up multiple conditions and find conditions that satisfy them, and set the syntax to occur when all conditions are not met.

### If door

If you put the condition in the if statement and meet the condition, the phrase within the if statement is called.

The following is an example of the use of an if statement:

```js
'if (conditions) {
// Execution Statement
}

var a = 10;
var b = 20;

if(a < b) {
console.log('a' is less than b');
}
```

An If statement is a statement that can be executed or not, depending on whether the condition is true or false.

if, else

If the if statement meets the condition, then the else statement is executed when the condition of the if statement is not met.

The following is an example of using the if, else statement:

```js
var a = 10;
var b = 20;

if(a > b) {
console.log('a' is greater than b');
} else {
console.log('a' is less than b');
}
```

If statement can be determined separately when the condition is true and false.

if, else if, else

If the if statement used only one condition, you can use the elif statement to compare whether multiple conditions are met.

```js
'if (conditions) {
// statement 1;
} elseif (condition) {
// statement 2;
} else {
// statement of execution 3;
}
```

```js
var a = 10;
var b = 20;
var c = 30;

if(a > b) {
console.log('a' is greater than b');
} else if(b > c) {
console.log('b) is greater than c');
} else {
console.log('All conditions are not met');
}
```

Use to examine multiple conditions.

Conditional statements and logical operators

Try creating an if statement using a logical operator.

```js
* ==============================+
*
```

```js
* ==============================+
* Use ||(or) operator
* ==============================+

var d = 10;
var e = 20;
var f = 30;

if(d < e || e == f ) {
console.log ('d is smaller than e and e and f are not the same');
}
```

Repeating statement

You can use a repeating statement to execute it as many times as you want.

For example, if you want to print out the phrase "Hi!" 100 times, you need to fill out the output statement 100 times, but if you use a repeating statement, you can write a single line of output and print it 100 times.

This means that using repetitive statements can reduce the amount of code and increase the efficiency and productivity of development.

The repeated sentences include `for door`, `for door`, `do for while door`, and `for in door`.

### For door

A for statement is a repeating statement that lets you execute a specific executable statement repeatedly until you satisfy the condition expression.

The for statement is more convenient to use than other repeat statements in practice, so the frequency of use is very high.

The default usage of the for statement is as follows:

```js
'for (initial value; conditional expression (comparative phrase); increasing and decreasing) {
// Execution Statement
}
```

for statement execution order is initial value -> Conditional expression -> Execution statement -> Incremental expression -> Conditional expression

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
console.log(i);
}
```

Let`s take a look at an example of using a for statement to simplify code processing.

The first is to use the for statement, and the second is to use the for statement.

```js
* ==============================+
* for statements not used
* ==============================+

var i = 2;
console.log(i);
i += 2;
console.log(i);
i += 2;
console.log(i);
i += 2;
console.log(i);
i += 2;
console.log(i);
```

```js
* ==============================+
* for statements used
* ==============================+

for(var i = 2; i <= 10; i+=2) {
console.log(i);
}
```

use for statements, if statements together

Next, we will use the for statement and write the conditional case for multiples of 5 from 1 to 500 and not multiples of 7.

```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
if (i % 5 == 0
```

### WHILE DOOR

The while statement plays a role similar to the for statement, but differs in that it only sets the last value.

```js
'var variable = initial value;
Â£(conditional)
statement of execution;
increasing and increasing ceremony;
}
```

The while statement must set the condition to declare the start value outside the while statement and repeat it according to the conditional expression, and create an incremental expression to prevent the while statement from falling into an infinite loop in the execution statement.

That is, the run order of the < statement> checks the conditional expression and, when satisfied, executes the run statements and increments in brackets. Then, check the conditional expression again.

```js
var i = 1;
while(i < 10) {
if (i % 3 == 0) if multiple of { // 3
console.log(i);
}
i++
}
```
