Learn the MySQL related settings in Ubuntu.

### Default Character Set Settings

When DB is created without setting the language set separately, it is set to latin1. In this case, there may be no problem when Hangul is printed on the bulletin board, but if you print the DB data itself? It is printed in the same character as .

```bash
sudo vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf

[client]
default-character-set = utf8

[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake=FALSE
init_connect="SET collation_connection = utf8_general_ci"
init_connect="SET NAMES utf8"
character-set-server = utf8
collation-server = utf8_general_ci

[mysqldump]
default-character-set = utf8

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8

```

After modification, restart MySQL.

```bash
sudo service mysql restart

```

First, log in to mysql.

```bash
mysql -uroot -p

```

Check the character set.

```bash
mysql> status

Server characterset: utf8
Db characterset: utf8

```

```bash
mysql> show variables like '%char%';

+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+
| character_set_client | utf8 |
| character_set_connection | utf8 |
| character_set_database | utf8 |
| character_set_filesystem | binary |
| character_set_results | utf8 |
| character_set_server | utf8 |
| character_set_system | utf8 |
| character_sets_dir | /usr/share/mysql/charsets/ |
+--------------------------+----------------------------+

```

### max_allowed_packet 설정

This value determines the amount of transmission by query statements. The default value is 16M, but this value is small, causing errors.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/mysql/my.cnf

[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet = 256M

```

Restart MySQL

```bash
sudo service mysql restart

```

### MySQL Optimization

To optimize MySQL servers, you can create my.cnf files using the Percona`s my.cnf generating tool. We generate my.cnf files in the form of each step-by-step question and answer. If the MySQL server already contains data and is operating, you must back it up, stop MySQL, and replace the file.

Back Up

```bash
mysqldump --all-databases --all-routines -u root -p > ~/fulldump.sql

```

Stop MySQL service

```bash
sudo service mysql stop

```

Back up the original my.cnf and replace it with a new file

```bash
sudo cp /etc/my.cnf /etc/my.cnf.backup
sudo cp /path/to/new/my.cnf /etc/my.cnf

```

Delete and reinstall the existing database

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql/*
sudo mysql_install_db
sudo chown -R mysql: /var/lib/mysql
sudo service start mysql

```

Finally all that`s left is to re-import your data. To give us an idea of how far the import process has got you may find the `Pipe Viewer` utility, pv, useful. The following shows how to install and use pv for this case, but if yoused on the average time taken to handle each row of the file, but the speed of inserting can vary wildly from row to row with mysqldumps:

sudo apt-get install pv

pv ~/fulldump.sql | mysql

Once that is complete all is good to go!

This is not necessary for all my.cnf changes. Most of the variables you may wish to change to improve performance are adjustable even whilst the server is running. As with anything, make sure to have a good backup copy of config files and data bef

MySQL Tuner is a useful tool that will connect to a running MySQL instance and offer suggestions for how it can be best configured for your workload. The longer the server has been running for, the better the advice mysqltuner can provide. In a productionll mysqltuner from the Ubuntu repositories:

sudo apt-get install mysqltuner

Then once its been installed, run it:

mysqltuner

and wait for its final report. The top section provides general information about the database server, and the bottom section provides tuning suggestions to alter in your my.cnf. Most of these can be altered live on the server without restarting, look through change in production. The following is part of an example report from a production database which shows there may be some benefit from increasing the amount of query cache:

-------- Recommendations -----------------------------------------------------

General recommendations:

Run OPTIMIZE TABLE to defragment tables for better performance

Increase table_cache gradually to avoid file descriptor limits

Variables to adjust:

key_buffer_size (> 1.4G)

query_cache_size (> 32M)

table_cache (> 64)

innodb_buffer_pool_size (>= 22G)

One final comment on tuning databases: Whilst we can broadly say that certain settings are the best, performance can vary from application to application. For example, what works best for Wordpress might not be the best for Drupal, Joomla or proprietarye database design is and so on. You may find it useful to spend some time searching for database tuning tips based on what applications you`re using it for. Once you get past a certain point any adjustments you make will only result in minor improvase environment through either using more powerful hardware or by adding slave servers.
