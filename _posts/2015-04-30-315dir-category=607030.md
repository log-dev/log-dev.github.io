### EM Elements

The em element indicates the Emphasis. The meaning of a sentence may vary depending on what is emphasized in the sentence. It can be seen that even if the same content is used in conversations, there is a slight difference in tone depending on what content is stressed (relative strength), which can change the overall meaning.

```html
A cat is an animal that is cute.</p>

```

- It is an element to elicit meaning change through context.
- The text specified by the em element is represented in italics to distinguish it from other characters.

### I Element

The i element is an overridden element in HTML5, which no longer means italics and has no significance or emphasis.

```html
Today, I ate French food, ilang="fr">Foie gras</i>.</p>

```

- It is used to express a different meaning or feeling from the surrounding sentences.
- It is used for taxonomic definitions, technical terms, idiomatic expressions, thoughts, ship names, etc. that deviate slightly from what was in progress.
- Use where visual or auditory distinctions are required. When a user processes information visually, when a tilted letter appears while reading an untilted letter, he or she will carefully watch the tilted letter due to its form contrast. This principle also applies to voice output.

### STRONG Element

The strong element is an element that is overridden in HTML5, indicating high importance.

```html
The most important thing is <strong>correct judgment</strong>.</p>

```

- It can be seen as an element for easy understanding by emphasizing the key word (keyword) of content.
- The em element changes the meaning of a sentence, but the strong element does not.
- Text designated by the strong element is expressed in bold typeface to distinguish it from other characters.

### Element B

The b element is an overridden element in HTML5, which is used in text that has a distinct style from other sentences without additional importance.

```html
The world is made up of <b>code</b> and <b>password</b>.
- <b>Sherlock Holmes</b> Miniseries - </p>

```

- It is used in the description of the product in the name of the product, or in a phrase typically expressed in boldface.
- It is used for visual emphasis.
- To help with a reading flow by making certain words relatively visible
- To help you read quickly by displaying a reading start point:

### MARK Element

The mark element is a newly added element in HTML5 that displays the marked text (MARKed or highlighted text. Marked text refers to text that is more emphasized than other text to attract user attention. It is similar to the effect of highlighting certain words with highlighter, and is different from em or strong, which emphasizes important parts of the sentence. Since there is no style defined, aiming only for visual attention effects, the effects are written directly.

```html
What I'm studying right now is <mark>HTML5</mark>.</p>

```

- Source: Mark elements are used when the author is quoting someone else`s words or content elsewhere, and when the author is required to arbitrarily highlight text that the author does not emphasize.
- Search word highlights: For search results, search words must be more emphasized than other words to process search results quickly. At this time, the search term is not originally an important word, but only an important word in a particular search context, so the em or strong element cannot be used. Scripts can be used to highlight search terms, which is a method that relies on visual effects to the extent, so it is desirable to use the mark element.
- Emphasis: Unlike em or strong elements, the mark element is used to emphasize text related to the current situation or topic being read. This emphasizes text based on situational factors rather than the author`s intention, so if the situation changes, there may be no reason to emphasize it.

### DFN Element

The dfn element displays the term definition (DeFiNing term).

```html
"<p>For more information, see the podcast</p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p><p></p></p></p> <p><p></p></p>

```

- Since the dfn element simply serves to inform the fact that it is a term, the title attribute should be used to describe the term directly.
- The browser uses italics to represent characters marked with dfn elements.
- Used when a semantic representation of the term is required.

### CODE Element

The code element displays the computer code.

```html
<code>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Hello~ World!</h1>
</html>
</code>

```

- It is expressed in a fixed-width font.

### SAMP Element

The sample output is displayed by a program or computer.

```html
If the browser cannot find the Web document, an error message <sam>"Oops! Google Chrome could not find www.example.com"</sam> will be displayed.</p>

```

- It is used as a kind of example.
- When a program or computer needs to explain what output it provides, it provides samples for easy understanding.
- It is frequently used in textbooks and manuals.

### KBD Elements

The kbd element displays the KeyBoorD input. Keyboard input is to select a specific key on the keyboard, such as Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Delete, etc., to execute a command, or to enter text in a text field using the keyboard.

```html
Press "<p><kbd>Delete</p></p>

```

- It is expressed in a fixed-width font.

### VAR Elements

The var element displays a variable (VARible).

```html
The number of occurrences of a <p> event is <var>n</var>.</p>

```

- Characters with var elements are usually expressed in italics.
