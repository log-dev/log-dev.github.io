A library that helps clients provide previously covered image examples (placehold) Web services. We learn about this because we can set up more things than the web service provides.

### Holder Introduction

Holder is a library that replaces images in designated locations, and can use Cnavas and SVG to set behavior for changes in color, font, and window size. Above all, it is highly utilized because it supports an environment where window size changes fluidly.

- Chrome
- Firefox 3+
- Safari 4+
- IE9+ (Some 6-8 support)
- Opera 12+
- Android(with fallback)

### How to use Holder

Insert `holder.js` into HTML document.

```html
<script src="holder.js"></script>

```

Holder processes all images with certain `src` properties as shown below.

```html
<img src="holder.js/300x200">

```

The above example outputs an image of 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.

In order to avoid console 404 errors, `data-src` should be used instead of `src` properties.

### Placeholder options

The Placeholder option is set using the URL attribute (e.g. `holder.js/300x200?x=y)

- `theme`: Set the theme of placeholder. 예. `holder.js/300x200?theme=sky`
- `random`: Set a random theme. 예. `holder.js/300x200?random=yes`
- `bg`: Set background color. 예. `holder.js/300x200?bg=2a2025`
- `fg`: Set the foreground color (letter color). 예. `holder.js/300x200?fg=ffffff`
- `text` : Set the desired phrase. 예. `holder.js/300x200?text=Hello`
- `size` : The size of characters and the basic unit is pt. Yes. `holder.js/300x200?size=50`
- `font` : desired font setting. 예. `holder.js/300x200?font=Helvetica`
- `align`: Text alignment. 예. `holder.js/300x200?align=left`
- `outline`: Draw an outline and diagonal line on the placeholder. 예. `holder.js/300x200?outline=yes`

Holder includes themes that help users harmonize with their layout.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/25324B4255BD3CDF17)

Six basic themes: `sky`, `vine`, `lava`, `gray`, `industrial`, and `social`

There are five characteristics of `foreground`, `background`, `size`, `font`, and `fontweight`. The size property specifies the minimum font size for the theme. The default value for fontweight is `bold`.

You can create your own themes such as:

```js
Holder.addTheme("dark", {
background: "#000",
foreground: "#aaa",
size: 11,
font: "Monaco",
fontweight: "normal"
});

```

If you have a placeholder group that wants to use a specific phrase, you can add a `text` attribute to the theme.

```js
Holder.addTheme("thumbnail", { background: "#fff", text: "Thumbnail" });

```

Two ways to use the theme you added:

- Insert a theme at runtime and display the placeholder using the theme name.
- Insert a theme anywhere and re-display the placeholder using the theme name.

The first way is the easiest way. After inserting `holder.js`, add a script tag that adds the desired theme:

```html
<script src="holder.js"></script>
<script>
Holder.addTheme("bright", {
background: "white", foreground: "gray", size: 12
});
</script>

```

The second method should be called `run` after adding a theme.

```js
Holder.addTheme("bright", {background: "white", foreground: "gray", size: 12}).run();

```

You can use Holder in different areas for different images with added themes.

```html
<img data-src="example.com/100x100?theme=simple" id="new">

```

```js
Holder.run({
domain: "example.com",
themes: {
"simple": {
background: "#fff",
foreground: "#000",
size: 12
}
},
images: "#new"
});

```

The chain call allows the addition of a placeholder programmatically.

```js
Holder.addTheme("new", {
foreground: "#ccc",
background: "#000",
size: 10
}).addImage("holder.js/200x100?theme=new", "body").run();

```

The first factor in `addImage` is the `src` property, and the second factor is the CSS selector for the parent element.

Holder automatically adds line breaks to the letter if it deviates from the boundaries of the image. If the letter is too long to deviate from both the horizontal and vertical boundaries, the letter is moved up. If you want to control line change, you can add `\n` to `text` properties.

```html
<img data-src="holder.js/300x200?text=Add \n line breaks \n anywhere.">

```

To release line change, `true` is set in `nowrap` option.

```html
<img data-src="holder.js/300x200?text=Add \n line breaks \n anywhere.
```

Placeholders, which use directly specified fonts, are SVG constraints on resource connectivity between domains, and are basically output using canvas. If fonts are used only locally, it is possible to disable behavior by setting `noFontFallback` as `ture` in the `Holder.run` option. However, if SVG placeholder needs to be printed using an externally loaded font, `object` tag should be used instead of `img` tag and `holderjs` class should be added to that `link` tag.

```html
<head>
<link href="http://.../font-awesome.css" rel="stylesheet" class="holderjs">
</head>
<body>
<object data-src="holder.js/300x200?font=FontAwesome"></object>

```

When tested locally, the font URL must have HTTP or HTTPS defined in the protocol.

`object` placeholders work like `img` placeholders that can be inspected and modified with the added benefits of their DOM. Like img placeholders, the `data-src` property is more reliable than the `data` property.

When numerical values are specified in percentages, a flexible placeholder is created to respond to media queries.

```html
<img data-src="holder.js/100px200">

```

Basically, the fluid placeholder shows the current size in pixels.Because it is fluid, this value changes depending on the size of the window. To be expressed in percentage dimensions, such as 100%x75, the text mode flag must be set to `holder.js/100px75?textmode=literal` in the same character.

Pixel vs Percentage Unit

To avoid forced image size, use `auto` flag.

```html
<img data-src="holder.js/200x200?auto=yes">

```

The above example is output without being affected by the width or height of any embedded CSS.

When `exact` is set with `textmode` flag, it shows current size of placeholder that is automatically determined.

In exact mode, flexible placeholders and automatically sized placeholders are updated in size as the window size changes. To set whether to update a particular image when the window size changes, you can use the `setResizeUpdate` method.

```js
var img = $('#placeholder').get(0);
Holder.setResizeUpdate(img, false);

```

The above example temporarily stops updating the specified image (DOM must be an object).

To use the update again, run it as shown below.

```js
Holder.setResizeUpdate(img, true);

```

Update the placeholder immediately and print it out.

Holder can output placeholders as background images for `holderjs` class elements.

```css
#sample {background:url(?holder.js/200x200?theme=social) no-repeat}

```

```html
<div id="sample" class="holderjs"></div>

```

CSS의 Holder URL은 `?" must be put before you. The holder URL can be specified in the `data-background-src` attribute, such as image placeholders.

```html
<div class="holderjs" data-background-src="?holder.js/300x200"></div>

```

The height and width of the element should be defined in the background placeholders. Floating background placeholders are not yet supported.

### Runtime Settings

Holder can set several options at runtime that affect the image generation process. They are delivered through `Holder.run` calls.

- `domain` : domain is used for image generation. Default value is `holder.js`
- `dataAttr` : HTML attributes are used to define fallback in the default `src` attribute. Default value is `data-src`
- `Render`: You can use a renderer. Its options are `svg` and `canvas`. Default value is `svg`
- `images` : CSS selector is used to find `img` tags. Default value is `img`
- `objects` : CSS selector is used to find `object` placeholders. Default value is `object`
- `bgnodes`: CSS selectors are used to find elements with background placesholders. Default value is `body.holderjs`
- `styleenodes`: CSS selectors are used to find stylesheets imported into SVG placeholders. Default value is `headlink.holderjs`
- `lineWrapRatio` : Ratio that wraps letters from the outside of image. Default value is `0.9`

Immediately after including holder.js, `Holder.run` can be run in the customization setting to prevent it from running in the default configuration. However, `Holder.run` must be run again to output any placeholders that use the default configuration.

Holder is compatible with lazyload and operates on flexible and fixed-width images. For the best results, ".Let`s run `razyload ({skip_invisible:false}``.

### application

> I made an image upload form and used it. This is a way to display the stage using Holder before uploading the image and replace it with an image after uploading it. If you have to upload a fixed-size image in a similar way, it would not be bad to mark it using a holder.
