Function Valid Range and Closure

Closure refers to an internal function that can access variables in an external function (which it contains).

It is sometimes expressed as a scope chain.

Closer has three chain of scope.

Access to the closure self (the variables defined within its own block), access to variables from external functions, and access to global variables. It can be divided into three steps.

Internal functions can access parameters as well as variables from external functions.

However, the internal function cannot invoke the arguments object of the external function. (However, parameters of the external function can be called directly.)

### Function Valid Range and Closer

When the JavaScript interpreter invokes a function, the interpreter creates a calling object (also known as an activation object).

All function parameters and region variables declared by var statements are defined within the calling object and are defined as the properties of the calling object.

In the following example, the f1 calling object contains y1 and x1 properties, and the f2 calling object contains y2 and x2 properties.

```js
function f1(y1) {
var x1 = 1;
function f2(y2) {
var x2 = 2;
}
f2();
}
f1(); 
```

### Function Valid Range Chain

The JavaScript function is executed within the defined effective range, not within the effective range in which it is executed.

Defining a function saves the current effective range chain and forms part of its internal state.

The highest level of the effective range chain consists only of global objects.

Defining an overlay function allows the effective range chain to contain an outer function, allowing the nested function to access both the factors of the outer function and the local variables.

When the JavaScript interpreter invokes a function, the calling object of that function is added before the valid range chain.

In the following example, when f2 is called, the effective range chain contains three objects, the calling object of the function itself, the calling object of f1, and the global object.

```js
function f1(y1) {
var x1 = 1;
function f2(y2) {
var x2 = 2;
}
f2();
}
f1(); 
```

### JavaScript Closer

The JavaScript function corresponds to the combination of the code to be executed and the effective range to which the code is executed.

This combination of code and validation is known as a closure in computer science.

All JavaScript functions are closers.

Sometimes you want to create a function that can hold values between function calls.

Local variables cannot be used to do this, because the calling object is not retained between function calls.

Closer can produce permanent and private variables.

Take a look at the following example:

```js
getUniqueID = (function(){
var id = 0;
return function(){
return id++;
}
})();

console.log("id: " + getUniqueID());
console.log("id: " + getUniqueID());
console.log("id: " + getUniqueID());

// The results of executing the above code are as follows.
id: 0
id: 1
id: 2

```

Another interesting example is:

```js
function makeMultiplier(x){
return function(y){
return x*y;
}
}

var multiply10 = makeMultiplier(10);
var multiply20 = makeMultiplier(20);

console.log(multiply10(5)); // 50
console.log(multiply20(5)); // 100

```

In this example, we defined a function called makeMultiplier(x), which takes one factor, x, and returns a new function.

The function returned by this function is returning x*y with the factor y.

Essentially, makeMultiplier is a functional factory.

In other words, it creates a function that can multiply a particular value with its factor.

In the example above, we created two new functions using the function factor.

One is a function that multiplies the factor by 10 (a function returned due to makeMultiplier (10)), and the other is a function multiplied by 20 (a sum returned due to makeMultiplier (20)).

Multiple10 and Multiple20 are both closers.

The two functions share the same function body definition, but the effective range chain is different.

In the valid range chain for multiply10, x is 10 and in the case of multiply20, x is 20.

### Module and namespace

Whenever you define a global variable in JavaScript, you always have the risk that the variable may be overwritten by other code.

Therefore, if you want to create a module, you need to avoid defining global variables and define both methods and properties for the module you create within the namespace that is specific to that module.

JavaScript has no specific support for namespace, but JavaScript objects can be used for that purpose.

You can first define a namespace object, then define and store the module method within that namespace object, not the global object.

Examples of modules and namespace include:

```js
// Define a global variable
var itinpractice;

// undefined makes it an object
if (!itinpractice) itinpractice = {}

// Namespace creation: itinfrastructure.Module1
itinpractice.Module1 = {}

// fill namespace with method
itinpractice.Module1.method1 = function(){
console.log("This is itinpractice.Module1.method1");
}
itinpractice.Module1.method2 = function(){
console.log("This is itinpractice.Module1.method2");
}

// method call
itinpractice.Module1.method1(); // This is itinpractice.Module1.method1
itinpractice.Module1.method2(); // This is itinpractice.Module1.method2
```
