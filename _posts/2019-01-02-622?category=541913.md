CSS transforms the shape and location of content by transforming the coordinate space without interfering with the general flow of documents.

That is, it was used to move by deformation or to control size, rotation, and torsion, and to the extent that this transform was only 2D that could adjust the X-axis, Y-axis coordinates.

Let`s move on to this 2D and learn about the CSS attributes associated with 3D.

## Properties for 3D transform

CSS conversion in 3D space is more complicated.

CSS 3D transform combines multiple CSS properties in a plane, includes rotation, zooming, moving, twisting in 3D space, and gives perspective and observer position to create 3D space.

The 3D transform has properties that apply largely to the element to which the transform is applied and set to the parent element for 3D processing of the child element.

### Properties that apply the transform to the element to which it applies

- transform-origin : determines which axis to rotate, default is `transform-origin: 50% 50% 50%;`
- backface-visibility: attributes that determine the visibility of the specific back,
This means that deformation can be applied to hide or show the back of an element (the upside down).
- rotateX()
- rotateY()
- rotateZ() = rotate()
- rotate3d(x, y, z)
- translateX()
- translateY()
- translateZ() = translate()
- translate3d(x, y, z)
- scaleX()
- scaleY()
- scaleZ() = scale()
- scale3d(x, y, z)
- skewX(): skew does not have the Z-axis of skewZ() and is not in fact 3D (only gives a sense of liveliness).)
- skewY()
- skew()
- Perspective: Perspective, vanishing point, and perspective.
For example, a lot of perspective methods are used in architectural drawings (design drawings) to show three dimensions in a plane.

### Properties for setting child elements to parent elements for 3D processing

- Perspective: Perspective, vanishing point, and perspective.
- Perspective-origin : Set reference point for perspective
- transform-style: preserve-3d: child of element placed in 3D space

### Perspective for 3D environments (projection point, perspective, vanishing point, projection method)

To represent 3D effects, you set properties for 3D, such as 2D effects, transform, transition, etc., and specify the most important projection points.

Please refer to the following pictures of the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis to understand the 3D effect.

To construct a 3D space, you must specify a vanishing point (projection point, perspective).

Otherwise, the intended 3D effect will not appear and it will appear flat.

The `Persepective` property is a property that specifies the distance of the observer`s point of view (position) to display perspective, which provides 3D space for the element by affecting the distance between the Z index and the observer.

This determines the distance between the Perspective plane (z = 0) and the user (observer).

Each 3D element with z > 0 grows, and each 3D element with z < 0 becomes smaller.

The strength of the effect is that the greater the value of this persistent property, the less distortion it causes. This means that the observer position appears to be 3d in a close-up view.

The `Persepective` property values are as follows:

- none : Keyword indicating that perspective transformation should not be applied.
- length : indicates the distance from the user to the plane (z = 0). Used to apply perspective transformation to elements and content.
Perspective transformation does not apply if the value is 0 or negative.

Perspective Basic Example

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="680" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/vKwjNk?height=680&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=vKwjNk&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=3D%20%ED%88%AC%EC%98%81%EC%A0%90%20%EC%84%A4%EC%A0%95%20%231&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="3D 투영점 설정 #1" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_vKwjNk"></iframe>

The first box has no effect, and the second box has lotateX (45deg).

It looks like the box is crushed because 2D turned the X-axis.

To assign a vanishing point to the third box, we declared to the parent, `transform-style: preserve-3d; persistent: 300px;`.

This property converts this element into a three-dimensional object, indicating a depth equal to 3D space.

In the example above, it should be noted that the property `transform` was used to declare rotateX.

The property (term) called transform is a term created because there is a variation of the shape itself in the 3D effect.

In the above setting, rotate the rotateX 45 degrees on the x-axis and declare a depth of 300px, looking at the wrapper area at a location as far as 300px away (observer position).

Typically, the element to which the observer`s perspective applies is that it is necessary to establish a sense of perspective on the parent element that contains elements that are transformed, not those elements.

This is to apply to the parent of the element to be transformed, and all the children of that parent will operate in the same 3D space from the same perspective.

However, if you want to apply 3D transitions only to those elements that transform, not to the parent, you can do so.

To apply 3D to only those elements, you can apply different values for the vanishing point (depth) as shown in the code below.

The following is an image to help you understand when you apply the vanishing point and the transform.

### The vanishing point of the parent element VS the vanishing point of the target element to be transformed

One of the examples we`ve seen earlier is the application of vanishing points to the parent container, and the other is the reflection of projection points to the element to be transformed.

You may not have noticed any difference in the example above, but using the perpective property for the parent element, which is a container, and the use of this property for the variant target element, produces fundamentally different results.

In particular, a component with 3D deformation has different results when it has sibling elements.

The following code is an example of defining the perpective property on the parent element that is a container and applying the perpective() function to each individual element.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="595" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/JKqqZa?height=595&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=JKqqZa&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=%ED%88%AC%EC%98%81%EC%A0%90%20%EC%84%A4%EC%A0%95%20%233&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="투영점 설정 #3" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_JKqqZa"></iframe>

If you look at the results above, you will see different results when projection points are applied to the parent and when they are applied to the target element.

In particular, you can see that the transformation of sibling elements with projection points reflected in parent elements is reflected by influencing perspective between each other, not individual elements.

### perspective

So far, we`ve rotated and reflected the vanishing point, but this time, we`ll move to translate and see how the 3D effect works.

The following code moves as much as 150px on the z-axis and reflects the vanishing point on the parent element.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="579" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/xONoYo?height=579&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=xONoYo&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=%ED%99%94%EB%A9%B4%EC%9D%B4%EB%8F%99%EA%B3%BC%20%ED%88%AC%EC%98%81%EC%A0%90&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="화면이동과 투영점" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_xONoYo"></iframe>

If you move 100px along the z-axis without specifying a `perfect` value when you move an element, of course no visual changes will occur to the element.

In other words, it moves 100px along the z-axis, but it is not clear because there is no point of view to measure the distance.

So if you declare `perfect` on a container element to configure a 3D environment, you`ll see the above results.

The above results show that the element is growing in size as it moves closer to the observer.

It should be understood that the `translateZ()` function and the `perceptive` attribute operate on the same axis.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2660D73F57BD0C2A1E)

It is understood that the Z-axis in the above figure is on the same line as the observer`s point of view.

In the example, at the observer point where the vanishing point reflection is 500px away, the element is moved along the Z-axis by 150px, resulting in a visual effect such as sticking out forward.

If the vanishing point setting is set to the observer position 500px away from the screen and the Z axis for the target element moves by 600px, the element will not be visible because it is located "behind the observer`s point of view".

### Effect according to vanishing point and order of application of Transform properties

So far, we`ve looked at the effect of projection points on the rotation and the Z-axis respectively, and now we`re going to look at the effect of rotating the angle and applying the translate at the same time with the projection points present.

If you apply this rotation and movement at the same time and reflect the projection point, the interesting thing is that there are quite different results depending on whether you rotate and move or move.

The following code is an example of moving to the Y-axis and then rotating it.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="580" width="100%" name="cp_embed_6" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/qNGzGO?height=580&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=qNGzGO&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=%ED%99%94%EB%A9%B4%EC%9D%B4%EB%8F%99%EA%B3%BC%20%ED%88%AC%EC%98%81%EC%A0%90%20%231&amp;name=cp_embed_6" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="화면이동과 투영점 #1" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_qNGzGO"></iframe>

If you check the code results above, you will move 200px on the Y-axis and then rotate.

The visual effect is to rotate as you move, or to rotate as you move, but in reality, you move and then rotate.

That is, it works in the order in which it is declared in the code.

It may not be difficult to understand the previous example, but if you check the next example, you may be tilted.

The following code is the same effect as in the previous example, but the variant is rotated first and moved to the Y-axis as opposed to the above.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="510" width="100%" name="cp_embed_7" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/KrLjOG?height=510&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=KrLjOG&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=%ED%99%94%EB%A9%B4%20%EC%9D%B4%EB%8F%99%EA%B3%BC%20%ED%88%AC%EC%98%81%EC%A0%90%20%232&amp;name=cp_embed_7" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="화면 이동과 투영점 #2" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_KrLjOG"></iframe>

If you check the results above, you only changed the declaration order of movement and rotation, but it has a completely different effect.

This is because it first rotates at an angle of 45 degrees and then moves 200px from the axis of rotation to the Y axis.

Please refer to the following picture for your understanding.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2636474857BD181733)

In the previous example, we will reflect the vanishing point in a 45 degree rotation and see what happens when you move along the Z-axis that we saw earlier.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="655" width="100%" name="cp_embed_8" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/pbmroq?height=655&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=pbmroq&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=pbmroq&amp;name=cp_embed_8" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="pbmroq" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_pbmroq"></iframe>

The above results have the same effect as popping forward on the screen because the Z-axis setting, which moves back and forth with a 45 degree rotation, was applied first.
For your information, if you understood the above Z-axis, you can understand that changing the Z-axis to the Y-axis for movement is no different from the result that did not reflect the `perfect` projection point.

### backface-visibility

Learn about the `backface-visibility` property that can show or hide upside-down.

The `backface-visibility` property is associated with a 3D variant and determines the three-dimensional backward visibility (inverted face).

This means that when a deformation is applied and an element is flipped, it can be hidden or seen with this property.

The `backface-visibility` property values are as follows:

- visible : shows the back side (back side) by default.
- Hidden: Hide the upside-down side.
