```js
var $p = $('p');
$p.css('border', '1px solid red').children('a').css('text-decoration', 'none')
(function (global, $) {

var num = 10;
var $body = $('body');


global.data = {
num : num,
$body: $body
};

})(window, window.jQuery);

function moving() {
console.log(this)

}
moving();
document.body.onclick = moving;

function car(arg) {
thisname = arg;
console.log(this)
}

var a = new car('jaehee');
var b = new car('minsu');

console.log(a.name);
console.log(b.name);

function Human(name) {

thisname = name;

}

var me = new Human('jaehee');
var he = new Human('minsu');
var she = new Human();


/*
$(), jQuery();

jQuery is a constructor function.
$() Factory (Factory) Function
$() internally initializes new JQuery() and prints it like a factory.
If you throw a dome object, it is returned as a J-query object.
$() is to call a function.
The fish-shaped bun frame is like, "If you put the factor in the salty box, you'll get a j-query object, but it's a factory, so don't throw the same thing over and over again."
Throwing once, that is, referencing, does not produce the same thing.
If you keep dipping it in the fish-shaped bun mold, you'll be full, right? Then the browser will be full, right?

The identity of jQuery.fn was created by the jQuery team with the ability to $
$ to enable it for users to extend jQuery functionality.It's fn.
In other words, jQuery parents are approached so that all children are inherited.

/**

* Created with the same object, but can be set differently. This is object orientation
* Always use this for elements or other things that change.
* Common use cases include Coffee.prototype.sss = function() {}

function Nav(el) {
return new Navi(el);
}
function Navi(el) {
console.log(el)
}
var n = Navi('ss')
console.log(n);

// var a = Nav('ss');

Well, then Jay-Query...

window.jQuery = window.$ = jQuery;

function $(el) {
return new jQuery(el);
}

var b = $();
