Script elements are often used to insert JavaScript. Learn about this and learn how to use noscript.

### SCRIPT Elements

The script element is used to create or recall programming code, such as client-side scripts, directly within HTML documents. The script element can be placed anywhere in the document, and there is no limit to the number of times.

If the script element is placed on the head of the document, the script is executed with loading. Put it in the head of a document when it is necessary to control its function throughout the document or when a script needs to be executed before processing the document body.

If the script element is placed just before the document`s `</body>, the script runs at the end of the document. This reduces the time spent loading documents because HTML`s structure and CSS` design are first applied and rendered on the screens of the users.

```html
<head>
<script src="js/vendor/modernizr-2.6.2.min.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
<script>
document.write("Hello!")
</script>
</body>

```

The type property is the property that specifies the MIME type of the script. Depending on the program language, the browser must be able to tell which programming language it is, using the type attribute.

The type attribute value consists of a type that specifies the media type and a subtype that specifies the program language, which are separated by a slash (/). In HTML5, text/javascript is the default value, so you do not need to specify a type attribute if the script type is the same. List the available property values below.

- type="text/javascript"
- type="text/ecmascript"
- type="text/vbscript"
- type="application/javascript"
- type="application/ecmascript"

The defer property specifies the deferr of script execution. When the browser encounters the src property, it temporarily delays parsing HTML documents to focus on external script files. The longer you focus on external script files, the slower the loading of documents will be.

Thus, when document loading speed is more important than script execution, the author writes the script at the bottom of the HTML document and marks it up to parse the components of the document before the script, which is also used to apply this effect to external script files. This property allows the browser to parse all HTML documents before running the script.

```html
<script src="demo_defer.js" defer="defer"></script>

```

The defer property is specific to the external script file and must be specified with the src property.

The async property specifies the asynchronous execution of the script. This property is similar to the defer property. However, while the defer property executes the script after parsing the HTML document, the async property runs after receiving the script file regardless of parsing the HTML document.

When the browser encounters a script element while parsing HTML documents, it receives the script file, then executes the script after it is received. While running the script, other elements in the HTML document are not parsed, resulting in a problem of delayed parsing the HTML document as a whole. To complement this, the async property is proposed.

When the browser encounters the async property, it puts the script behind it and first focuses on receiving script files and parsing HTML documents. The script is then executed when the external script file is received.

```html
<script src="demo_async.js" async="async"></script>

```

As with the defer property, the async property is valid only when the src property is specified.

### NOSCRIPT Element

The noscript element indicates no script support. This element does not appear when it supports a script, but only if it does not.

When the script is disabled in the browser, redirect it to a site or appropriate location that provides a method of activation using the meta element.

```html
<head>
<noscript>
<meta http-equiv="Refresh" content="0; URL=http://www.enable-javascript.com/ko/">
</noscript>
</head>

```

When the script is disabled in the browser, use the appropriate wording to come up with an alternative plan.

```html
<body>
<noscript>
JavaScript needs to be activated to take full advantage of the features of this site.
<a href="http://www.enable-javascript.com/ko/" target="_blank">
See </a> for instructions on how to activate JavaScript in your browser.
</noscript>
</body>

```

A 2010 study of Yahoo!`s network found that users who disable JavaScript account for about 1% of the world`s total traffic. Another study also found similar figures as a result of a survey of 1 billion visitors. These two studies show that the largest number of visitors to the United States have disabled JavaScript compared to other countries. It can be seen that the number of users who have disabled JavaScript is small enough not to worry.
