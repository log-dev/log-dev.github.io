Most drivers are caught automatically when installing Windows. However, the drivers provided by Windows are often slow to support new drivers, so you have to install them yourself.

### Check Device and Driver

After installing Windows, stop by Device Manager to see if there is a list that alerts you with a yellow exclamation mark (below is an example of your device manager).

Call the Device Manager by typing `devmgmt.msc` in the Win + R window.

### Installing the Mainboard Driver

It uses a basic driver that is held by Windows, but only installs specific drivers.

- Download the driver directly from the mainboard manufacturer (I use the ASRock H77 Pro4/MVP mainboard).
- Download the INF driver (either from INTEL or from their own mainboard manufacturer).
The IDE ATA/ATAPI controller is changed to intel(R) 7 series/C216 Chipset Family SATA AHCI Controller - 1E02.
- Download Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver and utility (either from INTEL or from their respective mainboard manufacturers).
The list of SDD and HDDs used in the "Safely Remove Hardware and Take Media" on the taskbar is displayed, and Intel board PCs have a Hotswap that allows hard disks to be used like external hard drives, which can be caused by AHCI activation. The driver installation disappears, but sometimes not (I install it because I have a docking area on my computer`s body for hot swaps).

### Mouse Driver Installation

In general, mouse drivers are not required, but mice with various functions may install related programs.

- Each mouse manufacturer downloads a driver or uses the accompanying CD (I use Team Scorpion Frost Wyam Gaming Mouse).
- The configuration is very easy, and the mouse is equipped with RAM and the settings are stored.

### Installing the Mainboard Utility

Mainboard manufacturers offer a variety of utilities, including Fan, CPU, overclock, RAMD, etc.

- ASRock Extreme Tuning Utility (Mainboard Utility)
- Restart to UEFI - UEFI-set entry utility for ASRock UltraFast
- XFast RAM Settings

### Installing the graphics card driver

Compatible graphics cards are installed when installing Windows, but Windows basic drivers may be superior in terms of stability, but most of them are not.

- NVIDIA Drivers
- AMD Drivers

### Installing SSD-specific utilities

Some utilities related to SSD setup are provided by manufacturers (I use Samsung Magician provided by Samsung).

- Magician Download
- User Account Controller (UAC) notification window coping
When you install Samsung`s Magician Utility, a notification window pops up every time you reboot. This is solved by removing Samsung MAGEMENT U-TIL from the startup program.
Win + X > Task Manager > Launcher Tab > Samsung Magician Application - Right : Disabled
It is only required to manually run Samsung Magician U-TIL if necessary.
