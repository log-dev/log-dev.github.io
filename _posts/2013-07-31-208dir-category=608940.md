We use NTP and rdate as a way to synchronize time. NTP should be used if accurate unit synchronization to decimal point is required.

### NTP Time Synchronization

NTP Installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install ntp

```

NTP Settings

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ntp.conf

server 1.kr.pool.ntp.org
server 1.asia.pool.ntp.org
server time.bora.net

```

Annotate or delete an existing list of servers and use the desired list of servers (the link below is a formal list of servers)

http://www.pool.ntp.org/ko/zone/kr

Restart NTP

```bash
sudo service ntp restart

```

Check ntp time synchronization

```bash
sudo ntpq -p

remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter

```

* means you are currently receiving sync

+ is accessible by the ntp algorithm but is not synchronizing

- is accessible by the ntp algorithm, but excluded from the sync-enabled list

Blank means not accessible

remote is the address of the stream 2 server on which you synchronize

refid shows the stream 1 server that each stream 2 server is currently syncing to

Unable to connect to server if st is 16

NTP uses udp port 123 and opens it.
