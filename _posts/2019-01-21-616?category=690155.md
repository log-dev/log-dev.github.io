Let`s take a closer look at how the list is styled and the CSS `background` attribute.

# Styling Lists

### Properties associated with HTML lists

There are `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `dl`, `dt`, and `dd` in the HTML list, and we will learn about the styles related to this.

The following properties are associated with the list:

- list-style-type : upper-alpha | korean-hangul-formal ...
- list-stye-position : outside | inside
- list-style-image : url("star.svg")
- list-style: square url ("star.svg") inside [Create shorthand type]

Set sequential lists (revers, items) using HTML properties

```undefined
<ol start="9">
<li>list-style-type : upper-alpha | korean-hangul-formal ...</li>
<li>list-stye-position : outside | inside</li>
<li>list-style-image : url("star.svg")</li>
<li>list-style : square url("star.svg") inside [속기(shorthand) 유형 작성법]</li>
</ol>

<ol start="9" reversed>

<ol>
<li value="2">list-style-type </li>
<li value="4">list-stye-position</li>
<li value="6">list-style-image</li>
<li value="8">list-style</li>
</ol>
```

## Wait here!(for line-height inheritance)

`line-height` is inherited by units. Let`s see how it inherits according to the unit.

When using em units

```undefined
<ul>
<li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</li>
<li>consectetur adipisicing <span>elit. Odit, porro!</span></li>
</ul>

<style>
ul {
font-size: 18px;
line-height: 2em;
/* if em is converted to px, the reference pixel is 18px * 2em = 36px; */
}
li {
font-size: 15px;
/* line-height: 16px; */
}
</style>
```

The important thing about the style above is that the font size 18px of the parent element ul is inherited as the offspring element.
Thus, the line-height of 36px is inherited from the li element.

This means that you do not calculate the line spacing based on the font size of your own font size for the child element, but instead use the inherited value of 18px for the parent element. However, if you untie the annotation part and re-declare another value `line-height: 16px;`, you will use the re-declared value.

When using unitless integers

```css
ul {
font-size: 18px;
line-height: 2;
}
li {
/*font-size: 15px;*/
/* line-height: 16px; */
}
```

Declaring the line spacing only as a unitless integer, as shown in the code above, will result in the inheritance of parent values to the child element, unlike em units.

Then, if the font size is overridden for the offspring element, it is calculated by multiplying the parent`s line spacing value.

In other words, if the li element does not have a font size defined, the line spacing of 18 * 2 = 36px is expressed.
If the li element has font size overridden, the corresponding element value of 15 * 2 = 30px is represented.

## Backgrounds

The CSS background property lets you set colors, images, locations, iterations, and pinning on the background of an element.

Modern browsers also allow you to adjust the origin of the background image or set the clipping area.

The space in which the background of the element is specified includes the content-box, padding-box, and border-box of the element.
margin-box is excluded from backgrounding as transparent.
Modern browsers allow you to change the area that occupies the background using the `background-clip` attribute.

The attributes associated with the background are:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

```css
div { background-color:#00ff00; }

div { background-image:url(bg.gif); }

div { background-position:left top; }

div { background-repeat:repeat-y; }

div { background: #ff0000 url(bg.gif) top left no-repeat; }
```

background-color

From `html` and `body` elements to inline elements such as `em` and `a`, you can assign background colors to almost every element in the document.

The background color is not inherited and the default is transparent.

The default value is transparent because if an element is not colored, the background color of the element must be transparent to make the parent elements visible below it (fake inheritance).

background-image

The `background-image` property sets the background image

When you create an image path in `url(``, the image in that path is displayed.

When the element box (background region) is larger than the image, the image is repeatedly displayed.

background-position

The `background-position` property specifies the starting position of the background image.

The background image usually displays the image from the top left (left).

This property lets you place the coordinates of the image where you want them to be, and the coordinate values are based on spaces (outspacing).
You can specify x, y coordinates for use.

The `background-position` property values are as follows:

- `Background-position: X% Y%;` : x is the horizontal (left, right) value and y is the vertical (top, bottom) value.
Top left is 0% 0% (default), right bottom is 100% 100% and center is 50%
- `background-position: Xpos Ypos` : x is the horizontal (left, right) value and y is the vertical (top, bottom) value.
Top left is 0 (px can be omitted at 0), right bottom is the largest pixel value in the region.
The % and px values are available together.

background-repeat

The `background-repeat` property allows you to specify whether to put an image in the background only once or repeatedly.

Typically, when you apply an image smaller than the container box, the image is repeated and output.

This property lets you define whether the image is repeated and where it should be repeated.

The `background-repeat` property values are as follows:

- repeat : default, repeat all vertical horizontal background images
- repeat-x : repeat background image horizontally (left and right)
- repeat-y: Repeat background image vertically (up and down)
- no-repet : Show background image only once without repeating

background short properties (shorthand)

`background` can be specified in any order between attribute values, but is often used in the order `background: red url(bg.gif) 50px 10px no-repeat;`.

And one thing to note is that when you declare a `background-position` value, you must declare it in the order of horizontal and vertical values.

background-size

`background-size` is a property that adjusts the size of the background image.

```css
background-size: auto | length | cover | contain | initial | inherit
```

The `background-size` property values are as follows:

- auto : Displays the original width, height of the background image as the default.
- length : You can set the width and height of the background image in units such as px, cm, etc.
If % is used, specify the width and height as % proportional to the parent element.
Specify width for the first value, height for the second value / and auto for the rest.
- context : specifying a value for contain, the background image is adjusted as large as possible under the condition that both horizontal and vertical are less than the element.
The size of the background image is always less than or equal to the size of the element because it maintains the image`s aspect ratio.
The width and height adjust the image the largest in a way that fits inside the content.
- cover : If the value is specified as cover, adjust the background image as small as possible under the condition that both the landscape and vertical length of the background image are greater than the element.
The aspect ratio is maintained. Therefore, the size of the background image is always greater than or equal to the size of the element.
This means that the image is displayed as large as possible so that the background area is completely covered by the background image.
Therefore, you should be aware that some parts of the image may not be visible.

background-clip 속성

`background-clip` is a property that specifies which part of the background (image or background color) to represent.

```css
background-clip: border-box | padding-box | content-box | initial | inherit;
```

The `background-clip` property values are as follows:

- Border-box : Populates the border area and its inner area.
- Padding-box : Fill in the inner margin area and its inner area.
- content-box : Populates the content area and its inner area.
- initial : Set to default.
- inherit : inherits the attribute value of the parent element.

background-origin

`background-origin` is a property that defines where the background image is based on the origin.

In other words, setting the reference point for the start of the background image is background-origin.

```css
background-origin: border-box | padding-box | content-box | initial | inherit;
```

This property also specifies the starting position among the three areas: border, padding, and content.

- padding-box : Default value; background image specifies the starting position relative to padding box.
- Border-box : Specifies the starting position for the background image relative to the border box.
- content-box : Specifies the starting location for the background image relative to the content box.
