Microsoft announced Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL) as part of its efforts to turn developers around. Considering the convenience of Mac and Linux development environments is good news for developers who are accustomed to them. Below you will find a brief introduction to WSL and its precautions.

### Introducing WSL

WSL, newly included in the Windows 10 and Windows Server families, is a new feature that allows Windows to run Linux commands directly through cmd, powershell, and so on. In other words, there is no need to port the programs and convenient tools available for Linux for Windows or get a version for Windows. In particular, IT developers were able to cross Linux from Windows to Linux, as they were developing in real Linux, consuming unnecessary resources through virtual machines and emulators.

Read the Windows Subsystem for Linux Overview for in-depth information about WSL.

As is the development purpose of WSL, it mainly functions as a tool for developers to use. The focus is particularly on web developers and people working on open-source projects, which are useful for those who want to use Bash, common Linux commands (sed, awk, etc.) and many Linux-first tools (Ruby, Python, etc.) on Windows.

Microsoft did not intend to support web servers, virtual machines, or containers, but the official version included support for the web server. Virtual machines are difficult to include containers such as Hyper-V and Docker because MS is developing itself.

I think the best implementation method for web developers like me would be similar to the following.

- Install an editor (such as SublimeText, phpStorm) that works with Windows, and create a folder to hold the project.
- Mounts the project folder in the WSL.
- A basic local server or PHP is configured in the WSL environment.
- Various development tools such as Composer, node.js, and Git are installed in WSL.
- Additional test servers use Docker containers on Windows.
- Testing of IE8, IE9, IE10 and others is carried out with virtual machines using Hyper-V.
- Since WSL does not work without running it, installing many developer tools has the advantage of being managed cleanly on Windows. In addition, even if various Linux packages are twisted, the difficulty of reinstallation can be eliminated by initializing the app of the Linux distribution that was simply installed.

Windows prohibits tracking, opening, or modifying the paths of files on Linux. Although it is possible, MS is dissuading it because it causes problems in the system.

Conversely, all actions that mount, create, modify, or delete Windows files on Linux are compatible with Windows and reflect changes in real time. In other words, several Linux tools can be installed on WSL and reflected in the project being worked on, and they can be updated in the editor, etc. on Windows.

### How far is it possible?

Not everything Linux offers is possible, but it is gradually expanding its support (from the initial use of simple Bash tools to the unexpected expansion of MS to the many demands).

- Because the repository is available, several tools can be downloaded and installed through package managers such as apt-get.
- Typical TUI editors such as vim, emacs, and tmux are available.
- Javascript/node.js, Ruby, Python, C/C++, C#
- Although the GUI is not formally guaranteed to be compatible, it can be implemented as an Xming of the X Window Server implementing the GUI.
- It also supports the requirements for building web servers such as sshd, MySQL, Apache, lighttpd, and others.
- You can run programs for Windows from the Linux console.
- You can run Linux programs on Windows.

- Containers such as Docker and virtualization technologies are unlikely to be supported. Even WSL can be thought of as a lightweight virtual machine that can be interlinked in real time (most similar to Docker technology).
- Kernel drives, kernel compilation, and updates are not possible.
- Other multimedia functions such as OpenGL and SDL are not possible.
- Windows prohibits modification and deletion of Linux files on WSL. This is covered in more detail below.

### Do not modify Linux files with Windows applications and tools

Do not change Linux files using Windows aps and tools.

Under no circumstances should you create and modify Linux files using Windows applications, tools, scripts, consoles, and more!

Opening files using some Windows tools can cause file and folder corruption by setting open files or folders to read-lock to prevent updating file content or metadata.

When you create/change Linux files on Windows, your Linux environment might be corrupted and you might need to uninstall and reinstall the distribution!

Linux files are files and folders located under `%localappdata%\lxss`, where Linux file systems (distribution boards and user files) are stored.

OSs contain different metadata (license, ownership, creation, modification time information, etc.), and Windows also does not know this metadata information for Linux. Windows does not automatically update metadata to reduce unnecessary overhead for the majority of Windows users who do not run WSL.

It is WSL`s mission to create/update Linux file metadata for all files under the Linux file system root and to store Linux metadata in the NTFS extended attributes of each file. WSL also aggregates pseudo-metadata for most files in a Windows file system.

The problem is that if you open, create, or modify using Windows applications and tools, the metadata for this behavior is written for Windows and does not contain any Linux file metadata, so Linux may have empty files, nonexistent or metadata, but the file contents are corrupted. There are also problems with Windows... (approximate).

Let Windows save and work on that file and have Bash approach it in the same way as `/mnt/drive letter/path` (e.g. /mnt/c/dev/project).

When Bash accesses a file on a Windows file system, WSL respects NT file system behavior, permissions, and so on, allowing access to the same file without copying or moving between systems.
