What is brother conversion?

When you write a code, you often have to convert a letter to a number or a number to a letter.

This is called a type transformation (data type transformation).

### Type Replacement Type

There are two types of transformations:

### Implicit Shape Transformation

Implicit type conversion refers to the automatic conversion of data types by the JavaScript engine, as previously stated.

In other words, the developer forces the transformation even though it was not wanted.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

The code above is a code that adds a string and a number.

Common sense is that if you add numbers, you have to print the result of 3 but 12 is being printed.

Like this, JavaScript has already created rules and is forcing the transformation.

When you operate a number + string, you force the number to be transformed into a string (raw data type) and then run the operation.

The following table shows the forced transformation.

In the case of Boolean + numeric types in the above table, the Boolean type true is forced into 1 and the operation results in 11.

(true = 1, false = 0)

### Explicit Type Transformation

Explicit shape transformations are called explicit type transformations, in which developers directly use scripts to specify which type to change.

In other words, I`m asking JavaScript to change the number type to text type data.

In the following table, we will learn about explicit type transformations that change characters to numbers and numbers to letters.
