While using Windows 10, you may want to go back to the previous window because you do not like hardware and program compatibility issues or certain parts of it. Describe the contents related to this.

### Downgrade Criteria

- Users who upgrade Windows can downgrade within 28 days. This means that users using Windows through a clean installation cannot downgrade users 28 days after the upgrade.
- You must keep all items in the Windows.old and Windows.~BT folders in c:\. It cannot be downgraded if it is removed or existing Windows information is removed through disk cleanup.
- All user accounts added after the upgrade must be removed.
- You must know the password you used to log in to Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 (if you used the password).

### Downgrade Method

You can revert to a previous version of Windows by returning to Windows * in Settings > Update and Recovery > Recovery from the Start menu. This option keeps your personal files, but removes any changes you make to the apps, drivers, and settings that you installed after the upgrade.

If you leave a few warning messages and proceed, it will reboot, restoring previous versions of Windows... I come across the message that.

When the downgrade is complete, let`s see if there are any problems with the previous files and authentication.
