Event object - keyup

In this article, we will learn about the `keyup event`.

### keyup event

The following example dynamically counts the number of characters that can be entered according to the number of character inputs, such as the writing input window.

Please enter Korean or English in the text area below.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/ZOypqG?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=ZOypqG&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_ZOypqG"></iframe>

The key event entered above used `keyup`.

Keypress event cannot be used in Korean if you want to implement the above.

Why use `keyup` event instead of `keypress`?

If you type in English, the keypress event is good to use, but Korean does not support the keypress event.

Therefore, you should exclude keypress events.

And you have to use a keyup event, not a keydown event.

This will be easy to understand if you know in what order keyboard events occur.

Keyboard events take place in the following order:

- The user presses the keyboard.
- A keydown event occurs.
- Letters are entered.
- A keypress event occurs.
- The user releases the keyboard.
- A keyup event occurs.

Therefore, no letters are entered at the moment of the `keydown` event.

We used the `keyup` event because we need to show the number of characters entered here.
