This article describes the terms that you encounter while installing Windows. Windows and other software use similar nomenclature, so let`s keep that in mind.

### Beta

The steps to test users with most of the technology that they want to include in the product before it is released.

### RC (Release Candidates)

Afterwards, the version that comprehensively reflects the bugs, feedback, and suggestions that have been tested and is released again, i.e. the release candidate. In the server group`s products, it will continue to be modified after the official release, such as RC2.

### RTM (Release to Manufacturing)

It is a factory-launched version of which the product is commercialized and distributed. When RTM is filmed and packed into DVD media and released into the market, the product becomes a Retail product. In addition, sending the RTM version to each OEM manufacturer will allow the OEM manufacturer to complete its applications and various additional work before being installed on the OEM PC.
