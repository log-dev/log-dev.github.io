Ruby-based Configuration Reference

The compass configuration file (.rb) is smarter than the settings you can do with sass and can do more things.

This configuration file is simple and convenient to set up your project.

### Basic formatting

Most configuration properties are simple properties that are placed.

For example, the following methods.

The properties that make up most of the .rb files have default type values, and the default types that can be set in the properties have three character types.

### Loading Compass Plugins (Load Compass Plugins)

Compass codes depend on the ruby for the mechanism that loads other libraries, and must be written at the top of the .rb file to load a plug-in that is compatible with the compas.

When a user creates a project using the -r option to access another library, it is already set up.

### Overriding Configuration Settings

The configuration options set in the compass configuration file (.rb) can override the configuration options settings if they are run through the command line (CLI: Command Window).

Suppose that the configuration options are already set in the configuration file as shown below and that you use compass commands in the command window.

Run Command Window

The configuration options within the configuration file are as follows:

In these cases, running the pass command in the command window will check the options in the configuration settings file, and values that are not set in the command window (CLI) will have default values.

### Setting options within a configuration file

If you have the following config.rb file, you can configure options as shown below:
