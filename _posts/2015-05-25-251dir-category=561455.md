These days, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) replaces what the BIOS used to do in the past.

A few years ago, I first encountered UEFI when I purchased a computer, and when I requested and received the item I wanted from Yongsan company, I was embarrassed because I couldn`t go to the bios setup screen. The previous computer had a bios selection screen for a few seconds at the first boot, and the POST process was visible, but without this process, the Windows logo popped up and the boot was in trouble. After a few reboots, he succeeded in entering the bios setup screen by hitting the DEL key in a row, but the world felt better when he saw the graphic elements added and the mouse worked. As we later learned, this was the newly introduced UEFI.

After I saw UEFI, I just thought, "Pretty. I said, "It`s fast." I just did what I wanted to do.With the addition of a 3TB HDD, there was another thing to think about. A typical MBR-based partition table was the basic partition table of bios, which only supported up to 2TB HDDs. When Windows is installed, the installation using UEFI mode allows installation as a GPT-style partition, which is described later.

### UEFI Introduction

The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) provides a graphical interface between the BIOS and the operating system. UEFI works with the BIOS to initialize the computer`s hardware and then provide the operating system with hardware control. UEFI also provides a variety of features that can be used before the operating system is loaded, which are stored on the hard drive, including system information, hardware diagnostics, and more. The Startup Menu provides access to UEFI applications.

- Using graphical elements and mice
- Support 2TB+ HDDs by using GPT instead of MBR
- Compatibility for outdated software, including the Protective MBR area
- Secure Boot feature improves security by making the loader only aware of drivers or operating systems with digital signatures

> Below you will find the UEFI settings based on the ASRock H77 Pro4/MVP mainboard that I have.

### Initial Boot Screen

The menu is available for the time set in UEFI at the initial boot screen as shown below (in some cases, if the value set in the initial UEFI is zero, this screen is not visible).

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/212958455554AB5134)

Use the F2 or DEL keys to navigate to the UEFI setup screen.

Use the F6 key to go to the bios update screen (requires the latest biosfile at the root of the storage medium such as USB/HDD).

Boot to the specified media (DVD, HDD, USB, etc.) only for this boot.

Go to the screen that shows the check and progress of the system.

### BIOS - UEFI Update

In the past, it was annoying to boot up with bios files to be updated using USB, but recently it has become possible to update through the Internet very easily.

On the UEFI setup screen, navigate to Advanced > Network Configuration, and set Internet Setting to DHCP (AutoIP). You can select an area from the setup screen, and you can choose anywhere. The update proceeds at the same time as the setup, but even if it fails, it is updated if you continue to repeat it.

- It downloads bios from the main board manufacturer (I am ASRock).
- Unzip the saved file and copy the bios file to the root of the USB (usb is formatted as fat32).
- After rebooting, use F6 key to run Instant Flash on Startup screen (using usb 2.0 port).
- Search for bios files and execute discovered files.

Consider forcibly shutting down the power when updating the bios or sending AS if there is a problem. Don`t think it`s all done with a single reboot, as the BIOS updates will take place after a few reboots!

### UEFI Settings Screen - Main

If you go to the setup screen using the F2 or DEL key, you can see the following screen. UEFI supports mouse and graphic elements, unlike in the past Bios days. This is possible because the bios could only exist in very small amounts, but UEFI exceeded its limitations.

The UEFI version and CPU, memory, and cache size can be found on the UEFI`s Main tab.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/27676E4C5554CA5E13)

You can explore the configuration of the main board through the System Browser.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/23153C4A5554CABA0C)

OMG also includes the ability to schedule Internet usage time. If you`re worried about your child`s use of the Internet...

### OC Tweaker

Overclock is a tab for overclocking CPU, memory, and voltage.

This is where the user settings for overclocking can be made (the writer maintains the default settings because the CPU currently installed is not intended for overclocking).

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2719304E5554CBF71A)

The overclocked CPU has a K version of the processor name, and for overclocking, the main board must also purchase a P series or a Z series (the following is my composition).

- CPU Ratio: `Auto` - multiples of CPU. Arbitrary/maximum value in K version
- Host Clock Override (BCLK): A change from Sandy Bridge to a role similar to the previous FSB. As the CPU is in charge of the main board`s work such as CPU`s basic clock and memory control, the main board operates as a BCLK (basic clock) used in the CPU. BLCK will operate components such as HDDs and PCI-E slots. The ability to allow this BCLK clock to operate only on CPU, or CPU/memory, and the remaining 100Mhz is only available on K-version CPUs (although it does not appear on the menu of the current main board, it is expected to appear if overclocking is possible).
- Intel SpeedStep Technology: `Enabled` - technology that adjusts CPU operating speed according to CPU utilization. Disable overclocking
- Intel Turbo Boost Technology: `Enabled` - A technology that allows each individual core to automatically overclock its work load using spare power and heat generation, which makes the system more efficient and effective. Conventional overclocking overclocking overclocked the entire core at once, which made it inefficient for power, such as wasted power, to move to a high clock even when the workload was low, but it complemented it. Disable Overclocking
- Long Duration Power Limit: `Auto` - Long Term Watts Power Limit
- Long Duration Maintained: `Auto` - Maintain power for a long period of time
- Shot Duration Power Limit: `Auto` - Short-Term Watts Power Limit
- The primary/secondary Plane Current Limit: `Auto` - Ivy Bridge architecture introduced three avx instructions to the CPU, which were limited because they consumed a large amount of electricity.
- GT Overclocking Support: `Disabled` - Intel internal graphics overclocking (with built-in graphics only)

Because I am using overclocked RAM, I call up Profile through Load XMP Setting and use the rest of the default (AUto).

- Load XMP Setting: Call up `XMP 1.2 Profile 1` - XMP 1.2 Profile 1 (if the profile is set on the purchased ram).
- DRAM Reference Clock : `Auto` - RAM 클럭 설정
- DRAM Frequency : `Auto` - RAM bandwidth setting

Use Auto if you do not want to overclock with voltage-related settings.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2463213D5554D50737)

- Power Saving Mode : `Disabled` - Mainboard`s own power reduction technology and battery saving technology that is useful for laptops rather than PCs.
- CPU Voltage Offset: `Auto` - Set CPU voltage and increase availability of overclock voltage to find stable value.
- CPU Load-Line Calibration: `Auto` - CPU protection at over-voltage, setting current versus voltage
- IGPU Voltage Offset: `Auto` - Set Voltage for CPU Internal Graphics
- IGPU Load-Line Calibration: `Auto` - Graphical overvoltage protection within CPU
- DRAM Voltage: `Auto` - DRAM Voltage Settings
- VTT Voltage: `Auto` - Set Internal Memory Controller (IMC) Voltage
- PCH Voltage: `Auto` - Platform Controller Hub Voltage Settings
- CPU PLL Voltage: `Auto` - Phase Locked Loop, Internal Clock Generator Voltage Settings
- VCCSA Voltage: `Auto` - VCC for System Agent, voltage settings for various controllers

You can save the set value and recall it from the ASRock utility AXTU to proceed with overclocking immediately according to the set value.

### Advanced

It includes UEFI updates with advanced settings.

When ASRock H77 Pro4/MVP was first received, there was no Internet Flash menu, but after UEFI update, the setting was initialized and the function was activated.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/22558B435554D76D2C)

It displays CPU dimensions and related technical support at the top. HT Technology is hyperthreaded technology, VT-x is virtualization technology, and SMX is the next generation of streaming multiprocessors and seems to be related to GPU.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2372A33E5554D7B105)

- Intel Hyper Threading Technology: `Enabled` (CPU with hyperthread only) - a technology that handles two threads in one core
- Active Processor Cores: `All` - Number of cores to use
- Enhanced Halt State (C1E) : `Auto` or `Enabled` and `Overclocked Disabled - Idle state to reduce power consumption. It is a technology that controls voltage and clock by understanding the after-life status of the system. It plays a similar role as EIST operating on OS.
- CPU C3 State Support: `Auto` or `Enabled`, overclock disabled - When CPU core stops working, L1/L2 cache is disabled.
- CPU C6 State Support: `Auto` or `Enabled` and `Disabled` overclocking - stores various tasks and blocks voltage that is supplied to CPU cores that have already stopped working.
- Package C State Support: `Auto` - C-State is a real-time power saving feature that reduces power consumption during use weeks by lowering or turning off the functions of the process when the PC is not used for a long time. This technology gradually measures the activity of the system and activates the power saving function in the order of C0 > C1 > C1E > C3 > C6 > C7. Recently, C7 technology was added, which stopped working until the last remaining L3 shared cache, cutting off power associated with DDR3 memory or PCI-Express connections. Although PC is still on, it is a technology that aims to provide power consumption that is practically the same as entering hibernation mode and hibernation mode.
- CPU Thermal Throtting: `Enabled` - technology that automatically limits CPU performance when the CPU is overheated, so that the PC is turned off automatically without over-heating. When this setting is enabled, excessive load at high CPU temperatures slows program execution.
- No-Execute Memory Protection: `Enabled` is a type of inspection function to prevent buffer overflow attacks that have been added since Windows XP SP2.
- Intel Virtualization Technology: `Enabled` - Whether to use virtualization-related technologies
- Hardware Prefetcher: `Enabled` is a technology that investigates memory access patterns and loads information that CPU needs in advance.
- Adjacent Cache Line Prefetch: `Enabled` - Intel Netburst Architecture (Pentium 4, Nehelm~)It is a technology that is provided by Ivy Bridge) that also applies Prefetch function to cache. It recommends activation on the desktop and deactivates it on the server.

The North Bridge is also known by Intel as the Memory Controller Hub (MCH), and is located on the computer`s main board. It controls communication between CPU, RAM, BIOS ROM, PCI Express, and South Bridge.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/240728355554DA8601)

- VT-d Capability is a VT virtualization technology that directly accesses input/output devices from a virtual OS and promotes performance in a server environment.
- Primary Graphics Adapter: `PCI Express` - If you use an external graphics card, you can set it to a slot.
- VT-d: `Enabled` - Virtualization technology for Direct I/O is built into Intel chipsets, which are provided in a hardware-assisted form to reduce VMM-related information and reduce processor involvement. In a typical virtualization scenario, where most data flows are controlled by VMM, processors spend a lot of time controlling data flows. It creates a data flow path between a physical server device called VT-d and a virtual machine, allowing most data movement to occur regardless of VMM or processor. This enables faster I/O and increases processor utilization.
- PCIE2 Link Speed: `Auto` - PCI-E bandwidth auto-recognition technology
- Share Memory : `Auto` - Set Memory for Internal Graphics
- IGPU Multi-Monitor: `Enabled` - Internal graphics cards must also be enabled to connect to and use monitors. It seems to be related to Lucid Virtu MVP.
- Render Standby: `Enabled` - Technology to reduce power consumption of internal GPUs in standby mode/PC locking
- Deep Render Standby: `Enabled` - It seems to be a technology that reduces electricity even more for health reasons.

Disable IGPU Multi-Monitor, Render Standby, and Deep Render Standby if you do not want to use the internal GPU at all. If you look at the device manager after deactivation, the built-in graphics are not searched.

South Bridge, also known as the Input/Output Controller Hub (ICH), is located on the computer`s main board and is responsible for input/output with each device attached to the computer. For example, moving the mouse sends the information to Southbridge, which sends the information to Northbridge, and then Northbridge sends it back to memory. The CPU then receives the information from the memory and computes it, which is then exported to the graphics card via the North Bridge, and the graphics card is then sent back to the monitor for printing.

- Onboard HD Audio: `Auto` - activates the built-in sound.
Front Panel: `Auto` - Front Panel is licensed.
On/Off Play : `Enabled` - 음? Does the software enable the ability to turn sound on and off?
In addition to the built-in devices on the mainboard, the Onboard devices should be disabled if they are mounted on PCI.
- Front Panel: `Auto` - Front Panel is licensed.
- On/Off Play : `Enabled` - 음? Does the software enable the ability to turn sound on and off?
- Onboard HDMI HD Audio : `Enabled` - 음? Does this mean that the built-in sound to transmit when connected to HDMI?
- Onboard Lan : `Enabled` - Whether to use internal LAN card
- Deep Sleep: `Enabled in S5` - It has only 5V standby power so that it can turn on by clicking on a keyboard or mouse button with a power key. I recommend the value of s5.
- Restore on AC/Power Loss: `Power Off` is a function that automatically turns on the PC when it is turned on or in sleep mode for various reasons (e.g., power outage, accidentally down the power cable) and then on again when it is powered up. I think there will be something to use on the server that should always be on.
- Good Night LED : `Auto` - It is a function that prevents internal LANs or Power LED lights from being turned on at certain times in the evening. If you`re sensitive to light, let`s activate it.
- Onboard Debug Port LED: `Auto` - Debugging Code Display feature installed on the mainboard The error code is located on page 39 of the Quick Install Guide (my mainboard does not support).

This is where the storage device is set up.

- SATA Controller(s): `Enabled` - SATA Controller Enabled
- SATA Mode Selection: `AHCI` - Setting SATA operating mode, improving ssd and HDD performance, and hot swap require AHCI!
- SATA Aggressive Link Power Management: `Disabled` - This technology reduces power to a minimum if there is no read/write operation on HDDs, but it takes time to power, rotate, and access/out again, which is not good for HDD life.
- Hard Disk S.M.A.R.T: `Disabled` - HDD`s speed is decreasing due to its ability to monitor the health of HDD.
- ASMedia SATA 3 Mode: `AHCI` - SATA operating mode of internal SATA 3 controllers.
SATA Boot ROM: `Disabled` - It seems necessary to maintain compatibility for using internal SATA 3 controllers. Is it necessary to use ROM instead of UEFI?
- SATA Boot ROM: `Disabled` - It seems necessary to maintain compatibility for using internal SATA 3 controllers. Is it necessary to use ROM instead of UEFI?

Intel chipsets provide native SATA 3 drivers needed to install operating systems in AHCI mode, but do not support drivers for embedded SATA 3 controllers such as ASMedia SATA 3. As a result, when installing an operating system on an HDD connected to ASMedia SATA 3, the above settings require ASMedia SATA 3 Mode to be operated in AHCI mode and SATA Boot ROM to be enabled.

When an operating system is installed without a driver, the ASMedia chipset is recognized as a "standard AHCI 1.0 Serial ATA controller" (Windows 8.1 is a standard SATA AHCI controller). It is easy to use additional drivers without installing them. When installing a driver provided by the Ezrak homepage, it is recognized as an Asmedia 106x SATA controller. However, non-native SATA is reported to have a lot of problems with its stability, so try not to use the user style as much as possible.

When waking up from sleep mode, this technology allows users to skip separate hardware POST steps and boot up immediately to boot at high speed. Below are the things that are necessary for the construction.

- Intel® Z77/H77/Q77 Express Chipset-based desktop board
- Intel® Core™ Processor in the LGA1155 package
- Solid State Drive (SSD)
- Hard Disk Drive (optional for Intel Smart Response Technology)
- Operating system: Microsoft Windows 7* (32- or 64-bit edition)

- No Vailed Intel Rapid Start Partition Found: Intel Rapid Start requires a dedicated partition, but from Windows 8, installation in UEFI mode automatically installs Rapid Start. If you did not install Windows in UEFI mode, you will see a message that no partitions were found.
- Intel(R) Rapid Start Technology: `Enalbed` - I don`t use this value, but if this value is disabled, an error message may appear.
- Entry After: `10 minutes` - Rapid Start technology is applied 10 minutes after power saving mode starts.
- Active Page Threshold Support: `Disabled` - Active Page Threshold Support??

Although I do not currently apply this technology to my desktop, it does not take about five seconds to reboot, even if the power is off, due to the sleep mode being in progress and the S5 (keyboard or mouse wake-up mode is disabled and booted. It seems to be true that the benefits of using this technology are hard to see because it already uses SSDs. However, I think I can feel the effect if I install an operating system on the HDD and use it.

Intel Smart Response Technology (including Intel Rapid Storage) technology allows systems to be configured by combining the advantages of HDDs and SSDs. In other words, the combination of the high capacity of HDDs and the cache speed of SSDs will enable them to take advantage of the high capacity of HDDs while delivering SSD-like access speeds. When applying this technology, the use of Rapid Start technology first requires accelerating the HDD using Intel Smart Response Technology, then creating a Hibernation Partition with DISKPART, and applying Intel Rapid Start Technology.

It is a technology that renews RSS of various sites such as E-Mail, Twitter, and Facebook even when PCs are in Sleep mode.
