### Using two Gitolite pub keys

When using gitolite, one user may need to log in from two machines. If user id is different, it would be no problem, but if it is the same, the names of the two pub keys are the same and cannot be added to the gitolite.

In this case, save the file name of the pub key to the keys folder in the following format.

userid@pc1.pub

userid@pc2.pub

In the gitolite.conf file, you can add a permission of userid.

```undefined
RW+ = userid

```

The client can use a key without any difference from using one key.
