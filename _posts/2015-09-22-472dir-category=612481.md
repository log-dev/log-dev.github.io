YouTube provides various information and semnails about YouTube videos through the YouTube Data API. You may need a thumbnail of the video inserted in the document, so you clean this up.

### Thumbnail extraction with movie ID value

The codes provided when sharing YouTube videos are often used in two ways:

Share: https://youtu.be/nVCubhQ454c
소스코드 : <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nVCubhQ454c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The `nVCubhQ454c` part of the URL of the share and the `nVCubhQ454c` given as the src attribute of the source code`s `iframe` are the unique ID values of the video.

YouTube provides a thumbnail through an API based on its ID value, which requires complicated procedures to be used formally. However, as I said before, the thumbnail is already provided based on the ID value, so you can call it and use it as it is.

YouTube`s thumbnail paths are as follows, and both paths support https.

i.ytimg.com 는 img.Short host name for youtube.com (i | i1 | i2 | i3 | i4 | s).It can be replaced by ytimg.com, which seems to specify a server or other purpose, but no relevant information has been found.

### YouTube Image Format

YouTube videos offer four types of number-type thumbnails and five types of thumbnails based on quality. However, not all videos offer nine types of thumbnail, but only seven types of thumbnail.

The size of the thumbnail varies depending on the size of the video, and the video used in the example is as follows.

High-resolution thumbnails are often not available because the original video must provide HD versions of the video.

The above seven types of thumbnail are the basic thumbnail provided by YouTube videos, and the thumbnail below is the thumbnail that exists in HQ videos.

### YouTube Data API

YouTube provides an API that provides various information needed to create applications using YouTube videos. To use the YouTube Data API (v3), you must register your Google account and application with Google and obtain a key. More than tens of thousands of requests a day are said to be available free of charge, but in some cases, a message may appear asking for payment.
