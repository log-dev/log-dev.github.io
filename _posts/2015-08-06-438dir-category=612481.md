Sometimes you need to match the height of the plotted elements or elements with multiple items. There is a plug-in that unites elements of different heights to a consistent height, which is introduced.

### Introducing MatchHeight

MatchHeight exactly matches the height of all selected elements. Similar types of plug-ins handled exceptional cases of mistakes.

### MatchHeight Features

- It automatically matches the height of the elements in the group.
- Use the maximum height or define a specific target element.
- There are no restrictions anywhere on the page or anywhere in the DOM structure.
- Reactive (updated when window size is adjusted)
- row recognition (to deal with plotting elements and enclosures)
- Calculation of `box-sizing` mixed with `padding`, `margin`, and `border` values
- Process images and other media (update after loading)
- Supports hidden or invisible elements (e.g. internal tab controls)
- Throttle with balanced performance and smoothness
- Easy removal if needed
- Keep scroll position
- Using the Data Properties API
- Callback event support
- Tested on IE8+, Chrome, Firefox, Chrome Android

### install matchHeight

jQuery must be loaded first and inserted later.

```html
<script src="jquery.matchHeight.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

```

### How to use matchHeight

```js
$(elements).matchHeight(options);

```

options are optional parameters. Called by DOM ready event (this plugin is automatically updated by window load).

It can also be used inline by the Data API.

### matchHeight options

The default options are as follows:

```js
$(elements).matchHeight({
byRow: true,
property: 'height',
target: null,
remove: false
});

```

- ByRow: `true` or `false` to activate row detection.
- property : name to set CSS properties (e.g. `height` or `min-height`)
- target : specify element to be used instead of element with maximum height
- remove: `true` or `false` to remove previous binding instead of applying new one

### Example of matchHeight

```js
$(function() {
$('.item').matchHeight();
});

```

The example above is ".Obtain the highest value of all the elements with the `item` and each ` .Set to `item` elements. If the items are distributed across multiple rows, the items in each row are set to the height of the item with the highest row.

```js
$(function() {
$('.item').matchHeight({
target: $('.sidebar')
});
});

```

The example above is ".The height of the first item in `sidebar` is set to the height of all `.item` items.

```html
<div data-mh="my-group">My text</div>
<div data-mh="my-group">Some other text</div>
<div data-mh="my-other-group">Even more text</div>
<div data-mh="my-other-group">The last bit of text</div>

```

The above example sets elements with the same group name to the same height as each other. `my-group` and `my-other-group` are set to the height of groups that belong to each other.

### matchHeight Data API

Data attributes can be used, such as "data-mh="group-name", which is written as arbitrary strings of elements to be considered as groups.

When a page is loaded, all elements with the same group name are automatically set to the same height without any additional code or location in the DOM.

The Data API enables `byRow`, if you do not wish to do so, use the other examples above.

### Using MatchHeight Advanced

Let`s look at some of the internal attributes and functions you need to know.

```js
$.fn.matchHeight._update()

```

If you need to manually run updates for a group that is currently set up, for example, if you have modified some of the content.

If matchHeight automatically requires notification (notification) to update the layout after certain Windows events, it can provide functions such as global callback.

```js
$.fn.matchHeight._beforeUpdate = function(event, groups) {
// do something before any updates are applied
}

$.fn.matchHeight._afterUpdate = function(event, groups) {
// do something after all updates are applied
}

```

`event` is the jQuery event object (load, resize, orientation change) and `groups` is `$.See fn.matchHeight._groups`.

```js
$.fn.matchHeight._apply(elements, options)

```

When preventing automatic update functions, we directly use the apply function.

```js
$.fn.matchHeight._throttle = 80;

```

Basically, the `_update` method is a throttle that runs at maximum speed every `80ms`. Reducing the value of the above `_throttle` property will update the layout faster, and performance will be degraded instead of being displayed smoothly when resizing. This value should be increased if a lag or pre-zing phenomenon occurs.

```js
$.fn.matchHeight._maintainScroll = true;

```

Under conditions such as resizing a page dynamically changes its size or adding new elements, a browser bug causes the page`s scroll position to change undesiredly.

If such behavior is found, the above syntax can be used to automatically force the position of the scroll. This global setting default is `false`.

```js
$.fn.matchHeight._groups

```

An array containing all element groups with matchHeight applied. It is used internally to automatically update resize events, but if you need to manually access certain groups, you can modify this array (e.g., if you delete an element).

### Known Limitations

It is necessary to change the height of the elements to ensure that there are no transitions (including all`) or other animations that delay a set of actions that match them. Otherwise, animations produce unexpected results because they cannot be computed.

Some browsers do not have webfont waiting for a window load event to occur. Thus, if the plug-in runs too slowly due to the loading of the webfont, it can produce unexpected results.

If this problem appears, if loaded using a webfontloader script or something, it should be called `_update`.

If you make changes inside an element with matchHeight applied, you will later be able to `$.fn.matchHeight._update()` should be called manually. This ensures that all groups currently set have the same height updated.
