CSS is relatively easy to learn and fun.
There`s nothing more accessible for beginners of web development.

CSS is definitely easy and fun, but the more advanced the work, the more inconvenient the work is.
The larger the project, such as the overuse of unnecessary selectors, the limitation of computational functions, and the absence of statements, the greater the disappointment.
However, there are no other options because only standard CSS can work on the web.

Then should we keep using CSS from now on?

# CSS Preprocessor 란?

If you are a person who handles HTML and CSS, there are Sass and Less that you have heard once.
These guys are CSS preprocessors.
It is commonly called the CSS Preprocessor.

The functionality that CSS uses before it operates.
Although CSS works on the web, we can offset the inconvenience of CSS with these extensions.

> SARS is an extension of CSS that adds strength and elegance to the underlying language.

### How do I use it?

As mentioned above, only CSS works on the web.
Preprocessors such as Sass, Less, and Stylus (hereinafter referred to as `preprocessors`) cannot be operated directly.
Then how can I use it?

CSS is uncomfortable, so we exclude it first and write it with a preprocessor (coding).
The preprocessor is very similar to the CSS grammar, but it includes the selection`s nesting or conditional statements, repeating statements, calculations of various units, etc… You can use much more features than standard CSS to create them conveniently.
However, it does not work directly on the web, so the preprocessors you create are compiled into CSSs of standard that work on the web.
It`s written by preprocessor, compiled by CSS, and operated.

### How do I compile it?

Different types of preprocessors have slightly different methods and offer different methods.
A compiler is usually required.
We`re going to look at Sass (SCSS) and we`re going to look at how to compile it.

### Why Sass?

Less, Sass (SCSS), and Stylus are the three commonly mentioned preprocessors.

I used Less the most and the entry barrier was relatively low for the first time.
The basic functions are all similar to the preprocessors, but personally Less had a big disappointment with some functions.
I`m not going to say it exactly, but there were a few times during the project when the function provided by Less was blocked by the limitations of the functionality that Sass or Stylus had.
However, the entry barrier is low, so it is easy to access and seems to be used that much.

In the case of Stylus, we are currently creating and using this blog (HEROPY).
It`s neat, more sophisticated, and has excellent functions.
However, it is less used (less famous), and it is less mature because it came out relatively late.
Maybe that`s why I see some minor bugs after compiling.

Sass (SCSS) has the advantages of both of the mentioned preprocessors.
The grammar is similar to that of Stylus, SCSS is similar to Less, and Sass and SCSS can be compiled in one compiler.
It is also the oldest CSS expansion language, starting in 2006, and has a high maturity, a lot of communities, and excellent functionality.
So I chose Sass (SCSS).

### What's the difference between Sass and SCSS?

The new SCSS, introduced in version 3 of the Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass), is a superset of CSS that supports all of the features of Sass created by introducing a new syntax to be fully compatible with CSS syntax.
In other words, SCSS supports Sass functionality with almost the same syntax as CSS.

The easier and simpler difference is the presence of `{}` and `;` (semicolon).
Compare the examples below.

Sass:

```yaml
.list
width: 100px
float: left
li
color: red
background: url("./image.jpg")
```

SCSS:

```undefined
.list {
width: 100px;
float: left;
li {
color: red;
background: url("./image.jpg");
```

Sass distinguishes the effective range of the selector by `indent` and SCSS by `{}.
Which do you like, Sass method or SCSS method?

It`s almost the only one, but there are other differences.
Below is an example of Mixins (`Mix-in` means how to create reusable features).
Sass is used as a short phrase.

:Sass

```bash
=border-radius($radius)
-webkit-border-radius: $radius
-moz-border-radius: $radius
-ms-border-radius: $radius
border-radius: $radius

.box
+border-radius(10px)

```

:SCSS

```undefined
@mixin border-radius($radius) {
-webkit-border-radius: $radius;
-moz-border-radius: $radius;
-ms-border-radius: $radius;
border-radius: $radius;
}

.box { @include border-radius(10px); }

```

Sass used Mixins function as symbol of `=` and `+`.
SCSS used functions as `@mixin` and `@include`.

Except for a few simple things, there is little difference, but complex sentences can have advantages and disadvantages depending on different environments.
Sass is more concise and easy to write, and `{}You don`t have to use `;` to make the code much cleaner.
SCSS can write inline code (one-line writing) and has a similar syntax to CSS, making code integration much easier.

Because there are several advantages and disadvantages, you need to use the way your company or team wants, or you can choose according to your personal preference.
You just have to choose the right way and use it.

For normal cases, SCSS is recommended.

# Compile Method

Sass (SCSS) cannot operate directly on the web.
To the end, it has to be operated with standard CSS, and we have to compile it with CSS after writing it with a preprocessor.
There are many ways to compile, but here are some of the recommended methods in the JavaScript Development Environment (Node.js).

### SassMeister

Simple Sass code may be burdensome to install the compiler.
You can use SassMeister in that case.

If you code with Sass or SCSS grammar immediately after accessing the page, it will be converted to CSS in real time.
It will be helpful to learn by writing HTML to see the applied results or supporting various environmental settings such as setting the Sass version.

### node-sass

node-sass is a library that binds Node.js to the compiler, LibSass.
Global installation and use with NPM.

```bash
$ npm install -g node-sass

```

Set the path to the file you want to compile and the path where the compiled file will be stored.
`[]` is optional.

```bash
'$ node-sass [Option] <Input File Path> [Output File Path]

```

```bash
$ node-sass scss/main.scss public/main.css

```

You can set multiple output paths.

```bash
$ node-sass scss/main.scss public/main.css dist/style.css

```

You can also apply options.
When you type `--watch` or `-w` as an option, the files are monitored during runtime and automatically compiled when saved.

```bash
$ node-sass --watch scss/main.scss public/main.css

```

Other options are available in the node-sass CLI.

### Gulp

In Gulp, the build automation tool (JavaScript Task Runner), you can create `gulpfile.js` to set it up as follows:
First, a global installation is required to use the `gulp` command.

```bash
$ npm install -g gulp

```

With Gulp, install gulp-sass, the sass compiler, in devDependency mode.
gulp-sass is a plug-in designed for use by Gulp with node-sass shown above.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sass

```

```js
// gulpfile.js
var gulp = require('gulp')
var sass = require('gulp-sass')

// General Compilation
gulp.task('sass', function () {
return gulp.src('./src/scss/*.scss') // input path
.pipe(sass().on('error', sass.logError))
.pipe(gulp.dest('/dist/css')); // output path
});

// Observe files during runtime
gulp.task('sass:watch', function () {
gulp.watch('./src/scss/*.scss', ['sass']); // the input path and the actions to be executed when a file change is detected.
});

```

I have set up my environment, so I compile it.

```bash
$ gulp sass

```

You can also run in file surveillance mode during runtime.

```bash
$ gulp sass:watch

```

### Webpack

The setup of Webpack, a JavaScript modularization tool, is more complicated.
See Webpack - 1 - Getting Started / EJS / SASS (SCSS) Post.

### Parcel

Web application bundler Parcel can be compiled very simply.
For more information, see Parcel - Getting Started / SASS / PostCSS / Babel / Production.

First, install Parcel globally.

```bash
$ npm install -g parcel-bundler

```

Install the Sass compiler (node-sass) in your project.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev node-sass

```

All you have to do now is connect the sass file to HTML as `link`.
No other settings are required.

```xml
<link rel="stylesheet" href="scss/main.scss">

```

```bash
$ parcel index.html
# or
$ parcel build index.html

```

You can view the compiled Sass file in `dist/`.
If you have not set up a separate port number, you can connect to `http://localhost:1234` to check the application status.

# Grammar (Syntax)

As explained in `Sass and SCSS difference` above, the functions of Sass and SCSS are the same, so we proceed with SCSS grammar for convenience.
However, if there is a difference between Sass and SCSS, we will explain them separately.

## Comments

The CSS notes are `/*... This is */`
Sass (SCSS) uses two styles of annotation, such as JavaScript.

```undefined
// Uncompiled Annotation
/* Comments compiled */

```

For Sass, `*` should be placed in front of each line when using multi-line annotations that are compiled, and the important thing is to align the line of `*`.

Sass:

```undefined
'/* Compiled
* Multiple lines
* Comments */

// Error
/* Compiled
* Multiple lines
* Comments */

```

SCSS doesn`t matter if each line doesn`t have a `* This makes it easy to be compatible with existing CSSs.

SCSS:

```undefined
/*
compiled
Multiple lines
explanatory notes
*/

```

## Data Types

<table><thead><tr><th>data</th><th>description</th><th>example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Numbers</td><td>Numbers</td><td><code>`1`</code>, <code>`.82`</code>, <code>`20px`</code>, <code>`2em`</code>… </td></tr><tr><td>Strings</td><td>characters</td><td><code>`bold`</code>, <code>`relative`</code >, <code>`"/images/a.png"`</code>, <code>`"dotum"`</code></td></tr><tr><td>Colors</td ><td>Color expression</td><td><code>`red`</code>, <code>`blue`</code>, <code>`#FFFF00`</code>, <code> `rgba(255,0,0,.5)`</code></td></tr><tr><td>Booleans</td><td>logical</td><td><code> `true`</code>, <code>`false`</code></td></tr><tr><td>Nulls</td><td>Nothing</td><td>< code>`null`</code></td></tr><tr><td>Lists</td><td>a list of values separated by spaces or <code>`,`</code>< /td><td><code>`(apple, orange, banana)`</code>, <code>`apple orange`</code></td></tr><tr><td>Maps< /td>Similar to <td>Lists, but with values in the form of <code>`Key: Value`</code></td><td><code>`(apple: a, orange: o, banana: b)` </code></td></tr></tbody></table>
 

### special note

Here are some of the specific things about the types of data that Sass uses.

- Numbers: Number has or does not have a unit(s)
- Strings: Characters have or do not contain quotes.
- Nulls: will not compile if `null` is used as property value.
- Lists: Do not attach or paste `()`.
- Maps: Make sure to attach `()`.

## Nesting

Sass can use the nesting function.
Avoid repetition of top selectors and create complex structures more conveniently.

SCSS:

```undefined
.section {
width: 100%;
.list {
padding: 20px;
li {
float: left;
}
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.section {
width: 100%;
}
.section .list {
padding: 20px;
}
.section .list li {
float: left;
}

```

### Ampersand (see Parent Selector)

In the superposition, `

SCSS:

```undefined
.btn {
position: absolute;
```

Compiled to:

```css
.btn {
position: absolute;
}
.btn.active {
color: red;
}
.list li:last-child {
margin-right: 0;
}

```

`

SCSS:

```undefined
.fs {
```

Compiled to:

```css
.fs-small {
font-size: 12px;
}
.fs-medium {
font-size: 14px;
}
.fs-large {
font-size: 16px;
}

```

### @at-root (out of overlay)

Use the keyword `@at-root` when you want to get out of the nest.
This is useful if you create it inside a nest but use it outside of the nest.

SCSS:

```undefined
.list {
$w: 100px;
$h: 50px;
li {
width: $w;
height: $h;
}
@at-root .box {
width: $w;
height: $h;
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.list li {
width: 100px;
height: 50px;
}
.box {
width: 100px;
height: 50px;
}

```

As shown in the example below, `.The keyword `@at-root` should be used, as in the example above, because certain variables in the list cannot be used out of range.(Variables are described below)

```undefined
.list {
$w: 100px;
$h: 50px;
li {
width: $w;
height: $h;
}
}

// Error
.box {
width: $w;
height: $h;
}

```

### Nested Properties

Properties with the same namespace, such as `font-` and `margin-`, can be used as follows:

SCSS:

```undefined
.box {
font: {
weight: bold;
size: 10px;
family: sans-serif;
};
margin: {
top: 10px;
left: 20px;
};
padding: {
bottom: 40px;
right: 30px;
};
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box {
font-weight: bold;
font-size: 10px;
font-family: sans-serif;
margin-top: 10px;
margin-left: 20px;
padding-bottom: 40px;
padding-right: 30px;
}

```

## Variables

You can specify repeated values as variables.
Always put `$` before the variable name.

```undefined
$ variable name: attribute value;

```

SCSS:

```undefined
$color-primary: #e96900;
$url-images: "/assets/images/";
$w: 200px;

.box {
width: $w;
margin-left: $w;
background: $color-primary url($url-images + "bg.jpg");
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box {
width: 200px;
margin-left: 200px;
background: #e96900 url("/assets/images/bg.jpg");
}

```

### Variable Scope

Variables have a valid range available.
Only within declared blocks (`{}`) have a valid range.

The variable `$color` is set within the block of `.box1`, so it cannot be used in `.box2` outside the block.

```undefined
.box1 {
$color: #111;
background: $color;
}
// Error
.box2 {
background: $color;
}

```

### Variable Reassignment

You can assign variables to variables as follows:

SCSS:

```undefined
$red: #FF0000;
$blue: #0000FF;

$color-primary: $blue;
$color-danger: $red;

.box {
color: $color-primary;
background: $color-danger;
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box {
color: #0000FF;
background: #FF0000;
}

```

### !global (Global Settings)

The `!global` flag allows you to set the effective range of variables to global.

SCSS:

```undefined
.box1 {
$color: #111 !global;
background: $color;
}
.box2 {
background: $color;
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box1 {
background: #111;
}
.box2 {
background: #111;
}

```

Instead, if you have variables with the same name that you already used, the value can be covered and used.

SCSS:

```undefined
$color: #000;
.box1 {
$color: #111 !global;
background: $color;
}
.box2 {
background: $color;
}
.box3 {
$color: #222;
background: $color;
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box1 {
background: #111;
}
.box2 {
background: #111;
}
.box3 {
background: #222;
}

```

### !default (set initial value)

The `!default` flag sets the initial value of the unassigned variable.
That is, if a variable is assigned, the variable uses the existing assignment value.

SCSS:

```undefined
$color-primary: red;

.box {
$color-primary: blue !default;
background: $color-primary;
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box {
background: red;
}

```

More useful, it can be used to mean, "We will set variables and values, but if there are existing variables, we will not use the values of the variables we are currently setting."
For example, if I connect an external Sass (SCSS) library such as Bootstrap and the variables in the code I wrote are the same name, there will be a problem.
Conversely, if the Sass (SCSS) library I created overwrite variables in other user code, users will no longer use the library.
In this case, the variables used in the Sass library (or newly created modules) are `!If you have a default` flag, you can use existing code (original) without overwriting.

```undefined
// _config.scss
$color-active: red;

```

```undefined
// main.scss
@import 'config';

$color-active: blue !default;

.box {
background: $color-active; // red
}

```

The following is part of the Bootstrap code (_variables.scss):

### #{} (Text interpolation)

Use `#{}` to put variable values anywhere in the code.

```undefined
$family: unquote("Droid+Sans");
@import url("http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=#{$family}");

```

```css
@import url("http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Sans");

```

The built-in function `unquote()` in Sass removes quotes from characters.

## Import (Import)

All sass files imported externally to `@import` are merged into a single CSS output file.
You can also use any variable or Mixins, etc. defined in the imported file in the primary file.

Sass `@import` imports Sass files by default, with several situations compiled into CSS `@import` rules.

- When the file extension is `.css`
- The file name starts with `http://`
- If `url()` is attached,
- If Media Query exists

In the above case, it is compiled according to the CSS `@import` rule.

```undefined
@import "hello.css";
@import "http://hello.com/hello";
@import url(hello);
@import "hello" screen;

```

### Import Multiple Files

You can also import multiple files into a single `@import`.
Separate file names with `,`.

```undefined
@import "header", "footer";

```

### File partials

As the project grows, files are divided into functions and parts such as `header` and `side-menu` for easy maintenance.
In this case, the number of files is increasing, and if all the files are divided into individual `~.css` files during compilation, it could be a problem for management or performance.
Therefore, Sass supports the Partials function.
When imported into `@import` by putting `_` before the file name (like `_header.scss`) it is not compiled into a `~.css` file when compiled.

Let me give you an example.
There are three Sass files in `scss/` as follows:

```bash
Sass-App
# ...
├-scss
│ ├-header.scss
│ ├-side-menu.scss
│ └-main.scss
# ...

```

Use `main.scss` for the rest.Import the scss` file.

```undefined
// main.scss
@import "header", "side-menu";

```

And compile these files into the `css/` directory.
(The compilation proceeds with the `node-sass` described above.)

```bash
Compile files in the '#'scss directory into the 'css' directory
$ node-sass scss --output css

```

After compilation, the files in `scss/` are compiled into one file each in `css/` as shown below.

```bash
Sass-App
# ...
├-css
│ ├-header.css
│ ├-side-menu.css
│ └-main.css
├-scss
│ ├-header.scss
│ ├-side-menu.scss
│ └-main.scss
# ...

```

Now, let`s put `_` on the name of the file to import.
The main file `main.scss` does not use `_`.

```bash
Sass-App
# ...
├-scss
│ ├-_header.scss
│ ├-_side-menu.scss
│ └-main.scss
# ...

```

```undefined
// main.scss
@import "header", "side-menu";

```

Compile in the same way…

```bash
$ node-sass scss --output css

```

It is used instead of being compiled as a separate file as shown below.

```bash
Sass-App
# ...
├-css
│ └-main.css # main + header + side-menu
├-scss
│ ├-header.scss
│ ├-side-menu.scss
│ └-main.scss
# ...

```

Typical build tools such as `Webpack` or `Parcel` or `Gulp` do not require the Partials feature to be used; they are built according to the set value. However, we recommend using `_` as much as possible.

## Operations

Sass supports basic math functions.
Useful for layout operations when calculating the size according to the situation or dividing the specified values.
The following are the types of operators available in Sass:

Arithmetic operators:

<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">type</th><th style="text-align:center">description</th><th style="text-
 align:center">Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`+`</code></td
 ><td style="text-align:center">plus</td><td style="text-align:center"></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:
 center"><code>`-`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">minus</td><td style="text-align:center"></td>
 </tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`*`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">Multiply</td>
 <td style="text-align:center">One or more values must be Number</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`/`
 </code></td><td style="text-align:center">divide</td><td style="text-align:center">The right value must be Number</td><
 /tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`%`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">rest</td><
 td style="text-align:center"></td></tr></tbody></table>
 

Comparison operators:

<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">type</th><th style="text-align:center">description</th></tr></thead
 ><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`==`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">equal</td
 ></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`!=`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">Inequality</
 td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`&lt;`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">Large/Small /
 Less than</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`&gt;`</code></td><td style="text-align:center
 ">Large/Larger</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`&lt;=`</code></td><td style="
 text-align:center">Large and Equal / Less than or equal to</td></tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`&gt;=`</code>
 </td><td style="text-align:center">Large and Equal / Greater than or equal to</td></tr></tbody></table>
 

Logic (Buline, Boolean) operators:

<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">type</th><th style="text-align:center">description</th></tr></thead
 ><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`and`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">and</td>
 </tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`or`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">or</td>
 </tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`not`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">negative</td>
 </tr></tbody></table>
 

### Number (Numbers)

Normally, it is calculated in units of `px` that represent absolute values, but for relative units (such as `%`, `em`, `vw`), it must be calculated as CSS calc().

```undefined
width: 50% - 20px; // Unit contradiction error
width: calc (50% - 20px); // computable

```

Because CSS allows `/` as a way of separating the number of attribute values, `/` may not be used as a division operation.
For example, `font: 16px / 22px serif;` uses `/` to separate attribute values for `font-size: 16px` and `line-height: 22px`.
In the example below, only the division operators are compiled without being computed.

SCSS:

```undefined
div {
width: 20px + 20px; // plus
height: 40px - 10px; // subtract
font-size: 10px * 2; // multiply
margin: 30px / 2; // Divide
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div {
width: 40px; /* OK */
height: 30px; /* OK */
font-size: 20px; /* OK */
margin: 30px / 2; /* ?? */
}

```

Therefore, the following conditions must be met to use `/` as a division math function:

- A value or part of it is stored in a variable or returned by a function.
- The value is bound by `(`
- The value is used as part of another arithmetic expression.

SCSS:

```undefined
div {
$x: 100px;
width: $x / 2; // divide the values stored in the variable
height: (100px / 2); // parentheses divided
font-size: 10px + 12px / 3; // use as a plus operation
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div {
width: 50px;
height: 50px;
font-size: 14px;
}

```

### Text (Strings)

The character operation uses a `+`.
The result of the character operation is based on the first operand.
If the first operand is quoted, enclose the operation results in quotes.
Conversely, if the first operand is not quoted, the operation results also do not process quotes.

SCSS:

```undefined
div::after {
content: "Hello " + World;
flex-flow: row + "-reverse" + " " + wrap
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div::after {
content: "Hello World";
flex-flow: row-reverse wrap;
}

```

### Colors

You can also calculate colors.

SCSS:

```undefined
div {
color: #123456 + #345678;
// R: 12 + 34 = 46
// G: 34 + 56 = 8a
// B: 56 + 78 = ce
background: rgba(50, 100, 150, .5) + rgba(10, 20, 30, .5);
// R: 50 + 10 = 60
// G: 100 + 20 = 120
// B: 150 + 30 = 180
// A: Alpha channels must be equal
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div {
color: #468ace;
background: rgba(60, 120, 180, 0.5);
}

```

In RGBA, Alpha values are not computed and must be the same for different values to be calculated.
You can use the following color functions for computing Alpha values:

opacify(), transparentize()

SCSS:

```undefined
$color: rgba(10, 20, 30, .5);
div {
color: opacify ($color,.3); // 30% more opaque / 0.5 + 0.3
background-color: transparentize($color, .2); // 20% 더 투명하게 / 0.5 - 0.2
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div {
color: rgba(10, 20, 30, 0.8);
background-color: rgba(10, 20, 30, 0.3);
}

```

### Logic (Boolean)

The Boolean operations used in the `@if` condition statement in Sass include `and`, `and`, or `negative`.
If you`re familiar with JavaScript grammar, `

<table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center">type</th><th style="text-align:center">description</th></tr></thead
 ><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`and`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">and</td>
 </tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`or`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">or</td>
 </tr><tr><td style="text-align:center"><code>`not`</code></td><td style="text-align:center">Negative (reverse)<
 /td></tr></tbody></table>
 

Let`s take a quick look at the example and look at the conditional statement for more details.

SCSS:

```undefined
$width: 90px;
div {
@if not ($width > 100px) {
height: 300px;
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div {
height: 300px;
}

```

## Recycling (Mixins)

Sass Mixins is a great feature that defines the CSS declaration group to be reused throughout the style sheet.
You can create different styles with a little mix-in.

First of all, Mixin only needs to remember two things.
Declare (`@mixin`) and include (`@include`).
We make it (declaration), and we use it (including it)!

### @mixin

The basic Mixin declaration is very simple.
Define the style using the `@mixin` directive.

```undefined
// SCSS
@mixin Mixin Name {
Style;
}

// Sass
= Mix in name
Style.

```

```undefined
// SCSS
@mixin large-text {
font-size: 22px;
font-weight: bold;
font-family: sans-serif;
color: orange;
}

// Sass
=large-text
font-size: 22px
font-weight: bold
font-family: sans-serif
color: orange

```

Mixin can include selectors and see parent (`) element

```undefined
@mixin large-text {
font: {
size: 22px;
weight: bold;
family: sans-serif;
}
color: orange;
```

### @include

`@include` is required to use (include) the declared Mixin.
I will use the Mixin declared above.

```undefined
// SCSS
@include Mix in Name;

// Sass
+Mix-in-Name

```

SCSS:

```undefined
// SCSS
h1 {
@include large-text;
}
div {
@include large-text;
}

// Sass
h1
+large-text
div
+large-text

```

Compiled to:

```css
h1 {
font-size: 22px;
font-weight: bold;
font-family: sans-serif;
color: orange;
}
h1::after {
content: "!!";
}
h1 span.icon {
background: url("/images/icon.png");
}

div {
font-size: 22px;
font-weight: bold;
font-family: sans-serif;
color: orange;
}
div::after {
content: "!!";
}
div span.icon {
background: url("/images/icon.png");
}

```

### Arguments

Mixin can have arguments like functions.
You can create a variety of results with a single mixin.

```undefined
// SCSS
@mixin Mixin Name ($parameter) {
Style;
}
@include mixed name (injection);

// Sass
= Mix-in name ($parameter)
Style.

+Mix-in-Name (Input)

```

> Parameters are a type of variable that is used to refer to one of several data provided.
The various data provided are called "Arguments".

SCSS:

```undefined
@mixin dash-line($width, $color) {
border: $width dashed $color;
}

.box1 { @include dash-line(1px, red); }
.box2 { @include dash-line(4px, blue); }

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box1 {
border: 1px dashed red;
}
.box2 {
border: 4px dashed blue;
}

```

Arguments can have default values.
If a separate argument is not passed during the Include `@include` step, the default value is used.

```undefined
'@mixin mix-in name ($parameter: default) {
Style;
}

```

SCSS:

```undefined
@mixin dash-line($width: 1px, $color: black) {
border: $width dashed $color;
}

.box1 { @include dash-line; }
.box2 { @include dash-line(4px); }

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box1 {
border: 1px dashed black;
}
.box2 {
border: 4px dashed black;
}

```

```undefined
'@mixin mix name ($parameter A: default, $parameter B: default) {
Style;
}

@include mix-in name ($parameter B: arguments);

```

When entering arguments to pass to Mixin, you can explicitly enter keywords (variables) to create them.
You don`t need a separate argument input sequence, so you can create it conveniently.
However, it is recommended that you set default values so that unwritten arguments apply.

```undefined
@mixin position(
$p: absolute,
$t: null,
$b: null,
$l: null,
$r: null
) {
position: $p;
top: $t;
bottom: $b;
left: $l;
right: $r;
}

.absolute {
// Pass only the values you want to set as keyword arguments
@include position($b: 10px, $r: 20px);
}
.fixed {
// Wrap up to gain readability as arguments grow
@include position(
fixed,
$t: 30px,
$r: 40px
);
}

```

```css
.absolute {
position: absolute;
bottom: 10px;
right: 20px;
}
.fixed {
position: fixed;
top: 30px;
right: 40px;
}

```

Sometimes the number of arguments to enter is uncertain.
This allows you to use variable arguments.
Variable arguments are followed by parameters `...Attach `.

```undefined
"@mixinMixinName ($parameter...) {
Style;
}

@include mix in name ( argument A, argument B, argument C);

```

```undefined
The arguments are passed one by one in order, and the third parameter ($bg-values) is received regardless of the number of arguments.
@mixin bg($width, $height, $bg-values...) {
width: $width;
height: $height;
background: $bg-values;
}

div {
// Forward arguments in order according to the Mixin(bg) setting above, and forward them after the third, regardless of number.
@include bg(
100px,
200px,
url("/images/a.png") no-repeat 10px 20px,
url("/images/b.png") no-repeat,
url("/images/c.png")
);
}

```

```css
div {
width: 100px;
height: 200px;
background: url("/images/a.png") no-repeat 10px 20px,
url("/images/b.png") no-repeat,
url("/images/c.png");
}

```

Above, the parameter that receives the argument says, "...` was used to leverage variable arguments.
On the contrary, we will use the variable argument as the value to be delivered.

```undefined
@mixin font(
$style: normal,
$weight: normal,
$size: 16px,
$family: sans-serif
) {
font: {
style: $style;
weight: $weight;
size: $size;
family: $family;
}
}
div {
// Forward according to parameter order and number
$font-values: italic, bold, 16px, sans-serif;
@include font($font-values...);
}
span {
// pass only the required values in the keyword argument variable
$font-values: (style: italic, size: 22px);
@include font($font-values...);
}
a {
// Forward only required values as keyword arguments
@include font((weight: 900, family: monospace)...);
}

```

```css
div {
font-style: italic;
font-weight: bold;
font-size: 16px;
font-family: sans-serif;
}
span {
font-style: italic;
font-weight: normal;
font-size: 22px;
font-family: sans-serif;
}
a {
font-style: normal;
font-weight: 900;
font-size: 16px;
font-family: monospace;
}

```

### @content

If the declared mixin contains `@content`, you can forward the desired style block to that part.
You can use this method to add selectors, attributes, and more to features that existing Mixin has.

```undefined
'@mixin mixin name () {
Style;
@content;
}

@include Mix in Name () {
// Style Block
Style;
}

```

SCSS:

```undefined
@mixin icon($url) {
```

Compiled to:

```css
.icon1::after {
content: "/images/icon.png";
}
.icon2::after {
content: "/images/icon.png";
position: absolute;
}

```

Style blocks passed to Mixin are evaluated in the range where the style blocks are defined, not in the range of Mixin.
This means that the parameters of Mixin are not used within the passed style block and are interpreted as global values.
It`s easier when you think of global variables and local variables.

SCSS:

```undefined
$color: red;

@mixin colors($color: blue) {
// Scope of Mixin
@content;
background-color: $color;
border-color: $color;
}

div {
@include colors() {
// Range within which style blocks are defined
color: $color;
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div {
color: red;
background-color: blue;
border-color: blue;
}

```

## Extend

Sometimes a particular selector must have all the styles of the other selectors.
This allows you to use the extension of the selector.
Let`s look at the next example.

```undefined
'@extend selector;

```

SCSS:

```undefined
.btn {
padding: 10px;
margin: 10px;
background: blue;
}
.btn-danger {
@extend .btn;
background: red;
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.btn, .btn-danger {
padding: 10px;
margin: 10px;
background: blue;
}
.btn-danger {
background: red;
}

```

Do you like the compiled results?
The results show that a Multiple Selector is created, separated by a `,`.

In fact, `@extend` should consider the following issues:

- My current choice (the " in the example above.Where will the btn-danger` be attached?
- Can unwanted side effects be caused?
- How large is this one-time expansion creating?

As a result, extend capabilities may be harmless or beneficial, but they may have the same side effects.
Therefore, extension is not recommended, and use the Mixin shown above as an alternative function.

For more information on why you don`t recommend using it, please refer to the Sass Guidelines Extension.

## Functions

You can define and use your own functions.
The function and Mixins are almost similar, but the returned content is different.

Mixin returns the specified style as shown above.
The function usually returns a certain computed value through the `@return` directive.

```undefined
// Mixins
@mixin Mixin Name ($parameter) {
Style;
}

// Functions
@functionName ($parameter) {
@return 값
}

```

There is also a difference in how to use it.
While Mixin uses the `@include` directive,
The function is used immediately as the function name.

```undefined
// Mixin
@include mixed name (injection);

// Functions
Function name (argument)

```

SCSS:

```undefined
$max-width: 980px;

@function columns($number: 1, $columns: 12) {
@return $max-width * ($number / $columns)
}

.box_group {
width: $max-width;

.box1 {
width: columns(); // 1
}
.box2 {
width: columns(8);
}
.box3 {
width: columns(3);
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box_group {
/* Total Width */
width: 980px;
}
.box_group .box1 {
/* Approximately 8.3% of the total width */
width: 81.66667px;
}
.box_group .box2 {
/* Approximately 66.7% of total width */
width: 653.33333px;
}
.box_group .box3 {
/* 25% of total width */
width: 245px;
}

```

As shown above, the function is used without a separate instruction such as `@include`, so the name of the built-in function and the function I specified might conflict.
Therefore, it is recommended that you put a separate prefix on the function you specified.

> Built-in functions are built into the application and are accessible to end users.
For example, most spreadsheet applications support a built-in SUM function that adds all cells in a row or column.

For example, `red()` is already a built-in function to get the red component of the color.
If you define a function using the same name, you can create a name such as `extract-red()` with a separate prefix because the name conflicts.

```undefined
The function I defined.
@function extract-red($color) {
// Built-in function
@return rgb(red($color), 0, 0);
}

div {
color: extract-red(#D55A93);
}

```

Or you can use a special name as a prefix because you cannot know the names of all built-in functions.
`my-custom-func-red()`

## Condition and Repeat (Control Directives / Expressions)

### if (function)

Returns only one of the two expressions, depending on the value of the condition ("true", "false").
Similar to a conditional ternary operator.

If the value of the condition is `true`, then `expression 1`,
If the value of the condition is `false`, run `expression 2`.

```undefined
'if (condition, expression 1, expression 2)

```

SCSS:

```undefined
$width: 555px;
div {
width: if($width > 300px, $width, null);
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div {
width: 555px;
}

```

### @if (instructor)

The `@if` directive is conditionally branchable, similar to if statements.
Instructions that can be used together are `@else` and `if`.
Additional instructions allow you to create more complex conditional statements.

```undefined
// @if
@if (conditions) {
/* Syntax when condition is true */
}

// @if @else
@if (conditions) {
/* Syntax when condition is true */
} @else {
/* Syntax when condition is false */
}

// @if @else if
@if (Condition1) {
/* Syntax when condition 1 is true */
} @elseif (condition 2) {
/* Syntax when condition 2 is true */
} @else {
/* Syntax when all false */
}

```

Because `()` can be omitted from the condition, it may be more convenient to write without `().

```undefined
$bg: true;
div {
@if $bg {
background: url("/images/a.jpg");
}
}

```

SCSS:

```undefined
$color: orange;
div {
@if $color == strawberry {
color: #FE2E2E;
} @else if $color == orange {
color: #FE9A2E;
} @else if $color == banana {
color: #FFFF00;
} @else {
color: #2A1B0A;
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div {
color: #FE9A2E;
}

```

The logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` can be used for the conditions.

SCSS:

```undefined
@function limitSize($size) {
@if $size >= 0 and $size <= 200px {
@return 200px;
} @else {
@return 800px;
}
}

div {
width: limitSize(180px);
height: limitSize(340px);
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
div {
width: 200px;
height: 800px;
}

```

Let`s look at a more complex but practical example.
Sass`s built-in function `unitless()` returns whether the number has units.

SCSS:

```undefined
@mixin pCenter($w, $h, $p: absolute) {
@if
$p == absolute
or $p == fixed
or not $p == relative
or not $p == static
{
width: if(unitless($w), #{$w}px, $w);
height: if(unitless($h), #{$h}px, $h);
position: $p;
top: 0;
bottom: 0;
left: 0;
right: 0;
margin: auto;
}
}

.box1 {
@include pCenter(10px, 20px);
}
.box2 {
@include pCenter(50, 50, fixed);
}
.box3 {
@include pCenter(100, 200, relative);
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box1 {
width: 10px;
height: 20px;
position: absolute;
top: 0;
bottom: 0;
left: 0;
right: 0;
margin: auto;
}

.box2 {
width: 50px;
height: 50px;
position: fixed;
top: 0;
bottom: 0;
left: 0;
right: 0;
margin: auto;
}

```

### @for

`@for` repeatedly outputs a style.
Similar to for statement.

`@for` is divided into the form using `through` and the form using `to`.
The two formats differ in how the termination conditions are interpreted.

```undefined
// through
// Repeat as many times as you want
@for$ variable from start through exit {
// Repetition
}

// to
// Repeat until just before shutdown
@for$ variable from start to end {
// Repetition
}

```

Let`s look at the following example to understand the difference.
Variables use `$i` by convention.

SCSS:

```undefined
'// Repeat 1 through 3 times
@for $i from 1 through 3 {
.through:nth-child(#{$i}) {
width : 20px * $i
}
}

// Repeat from 1 to 3 just before (Repeat 2 times)
@for $i from 1 to 3 {
.to:nth-child(#{$i}) {
width : 20px * $i
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.through:nth-child(1) { width: 20px; }
.through:nth-child(2) { width: 40px; }
.through:nth-child(3) { width: 60px; }

.to:nth-child(1) { width: 20px; }
.to:nth-child(2) { width: 40px; }

```

`to` can be useful if you need to repeat it until just before a given value.
However, `@for`, which is especially useful in `:nth-child(), is generally recommended to use `through`.

### @each

`@each` is used to repeat the List and Map data.
Similar to for in statement.

```undefined
'@each$ variable in data {
// Repetition
}

```

Let`s repeat the List data.

SCSS:

```undefined
// List Data
$fruits: (apple, orange, banana, mango);

.fruits {
@each $fruit in $fruits {
li.#{$fruit} {
background: url("/images/#{$fruit}.png");
}
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.fruits li.apple {
background: url("/images/apple.png");
}
.fruits li.orange {
background: url("/images/orange.png");
}
.fruits li.banana {
background: url("/images/banana.png");
}
.fruits li.mango {
background: url("/images/mango.png");
}

```

If you need an index value for each iteration, you can use the `index()` built-in function as follows:

SCSS:

```undefined
$fruits: (apple, orange, banana, mango);

.fruits {
@each $fruit in $fruits {
$i: index($fruits, $fruit);
li:nth-child(#{$i}) {
left: 50px * $i;
}
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.fruits li:nth-child(1) {
left: 50px;
}
.fruits li:nth-child(2) {
left: 100px;
}
.fruits li:nth-child(3) {
left: 150px;
}
.fruits li:nth-child(4) {
left: 200px;
}

```

You can also repeat multiple List data at the same time.
However, each data must have the same Length.

SCSS:

```undefined
$apple: (apple, korea);
$orange: (orange, china);
$banana: (banana, japan);

@each $fruit, $country in $apple, $orange, $banana {
.box-#{$fruit} {
background: url("/images/#{$country}.png");
}
}

```

Compiled to:

```css
.box-apple {
background: url("/images/korea.png");
}
.box-orange {
background: url("/images/china.png");
}
.box-banana {
background: url("/images/japan.png");
}

```

When repeating Map data, one data requires two variables.

```undefined
@each$key variable, $value variable in data {
// Repetition
}

```

```undefined
$fruits-data: (
apple: korea,
orange: china,
banana: japan
);

@each $fruit, $country in $fruits-data {
.box-#{$fruit} {
background: url("/images/#{$country}.png");
}
}

```

```css
.box-apple {
background: url("/images/korea.png");
}
.box-orange {
background: url("/images/china.png");
}
.box-banana {
background: url("/images/japan.png");
}

```

### @while

`@while` repeats the content until the condition is evaluated as `false`.
Similar to a when statement, incorrect conditions can cause you to fall into an infinite loop during compilation.
Use is not recommended.

```undefined
"@whil Condition {
// Repetition
}

```

```undefined
$i: 6;

@while $i > 0 {
.item-#{$i} {
width: 2px * $i;
}
$i: $i - 2;
}

```

```css
.item-6 { width: 12px; }
.item-4 { width: 8px; }
.item-2 { width: 4px; }

```

## Built-in Functions

There are many kinds of built-in functions that Sass provides by default.
We didn`t introduce them all, but based on subjective experience, we`ve organized only the functions that we need or might need.

You can see all built-in functions in Sass Built-in Functions.

- `[]` is a selectable argument.
- Disable Zero-based numbering.

### Color (RGB / HSL / Opacity) function

mix ($color1, $color2) : Mix two colors.

lighten ($color, $amount) : Creates a brighter color.

darken ($color, $amount) : Creates a darker color.

saturate ($color, $mount) : Increases color`s saturation.

desaturate ($color, $amount) : Reduces color saturation.
