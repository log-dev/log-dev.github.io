Establish and move on to the basic concepts of virtual machines. The next story about virtual machines will be about vmware, virtualbox, among system virtual machines.

### Virtual Machine Definition

A virtual machine (VM) is a software implementation of a computing environment, or computer emulation 1. You can install and run operating systems or applications on a virtual machine.

Virtual machines are divided into two categories based on the actual computer and some degree of communication and use. The system virtual machine provides a complete system platform, in other words, supports the execution of a complete operating system (OS). Conversely, a process virtual machine is designed to run a single program, i.e. it supports a single process. An important feature of virtual machines is that the software running inside is limited by the environment and resources provided by them and cannot escape the virtual world.

A system virtual machine is sometimes referred to as a hardware virtual machine, which multiplexes the physical computers underlying the virtual machines running each operating system. The software layer that provides virtualization is called a virtual machine monitor or hypervisor2. The hypervisor can run on a purely hardware or host operating system.

Key Benefits of System Virtual Machines:

- An environment with multiple operating systems can exist on the same computer with the operating system completely isolated.
- A virtual machine provides a different form of instruction set structure (ISA) than a real computer provides.

In other words, it does not have to suffer from multibooting to provide a variety of OSs, and each is independent of each other, so it does not affect each other. This gives ease of management and is a separate environment from external hazards, making it suitable for various test environments. Recently, cloud hosting, which virtualizes servers and rents them to users, is also a part of the development of virtualization technology.

Several virtual machines running my own operating system are referred to as guest operating systems, where different devices are used in server consolidation to run on each device to avoid conflicts, and each virtual machine runs on the same physical computer. This use is called isolation of product quality (QoS isolation).

A VM is also known as an application virtual machine, which runs common applications within an operating system and supports a single process. It is created when a process begins, is `ended` and destroyed. The purpose is to provide an independent programming environment that allows programs to run the same way on any platform, and brings in detailed parts of the underlying hardware or operating system.

Processes called virtual machines provide high-level extraction in advanced programming languages (compared to low-level ISA extraction in virtual machine systems) — Virtual machine processes are added using an interpreter.

This type of virtual machine was popular with Java, which was added using Java virtual machines. Another example is the dotnet framework, which runs a virtual machine called a common language runtime.
