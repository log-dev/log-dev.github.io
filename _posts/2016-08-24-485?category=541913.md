collasing margins

In CSS, there is a phenomenon called margin collapse or margin merge.

This collision of outer margins is a phenomenon in which 5 plus 5 is less than 10 and is called collasing margins, meaning that the two outer margins are called collasing margins.

### Collapse of outer margin

Usually, when the bottom outer margin of one element meets the top margin of another element, the margin merging occurs.

These two margins do not create spaces with each margin added, but rather the largest of them are called margin mergers.

Take a look at the example code for the following margin collapse (merging).

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/wWOOGp?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=wWOOGp&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_wWOOGp"></iframe>

The above code defined an outer bottom margin of 20px on the h1 element and an outer top margin of 15px on the p element.

Common sense is that it is right to have a space of 35px with two margins added, but it is not.

The web browser will only generate and insert the largest amount of margins.

So in this example, we`re only going to generate 20px of outer margin.

Perhaps this merger of upper and lower margin may not be unfamiliar because it is a well-known phenomenon, but this external margin collapse does not occur only in the upper and lower margin margins.

Margin coalescing occurs even when one element is contained within another, and users who do not face this case may unexpectedly scratch the back of the head.

Another margin collapse may occur if the parent element (contingent element) has a margin defined in one direction, top and bottom.

Let`s take a look at the following code to explore the phenomenon of a parent-child margin collapse. (Followed by the example above)

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="447" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/PzLLVa?height=447&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=PzLLVa&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_PzLLVa"></iframe>

In the code above, ".The type02-02` element defines the outer margin between the heading and the bottom paragraph by 20px.

We also defined the outer top margin of 10px in the type02-inner class, which is the h2 element and the child element.

This depends on the design, but here we define margins by assuming that there is a gap between the .type02-02 (div element) and another type02-inner.

In this case, you would normally think that there would be as much as 10px space between the div upper boundary and the text "Another Table Control".

But it doesnâ€™t.

In fact, this margin does not occur between div and h2, but creates an outer margin above the div.

In other words, the outer margin is applied to the top of the div.

This phenomenon, like the merger of the upper and lower margins, is also called the margin collapse phenomenon.

There are two ways to solve these problems.

Define a small inner padding or border within the retaining box (parent element).

Because the border line or inner margin falls between the two outer margins, the two outer margins of div and h2 no longer meet.

The code above is annotated on the border and inner margin, and if you remove the annotation processing of either one of them, you will have an outer margin that is free space.

Because of this vertical margin collapse, one of the common mistakes is to define the outer margin on the list type.

If you understand the above phenomenon well, you can solve it without difficulty.

For example, suppose you define `margin-top` to define common intervals for `li` elements.

And if there is space between the list contents and the top contents in the design, suppose that you give `margin-top` to the li and either the ul element or the parent element (containment box) surrounding the ul element.

If you define a style like this, there is nothing to distinguish, such as a border (boundary) in the style, so this will also result in a margin collapse.

Take the example code above and continue to look at the cases described so far.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="570" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/OXqqKB?height=570&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=OXqqKB&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_OXqqKB"></iframe>

If there is a paragraph at the top of the list as shown above, assuming that there is a margin of 20px between the paragraph and the contents of the list, you will try to define the outer margin by defining the `margin-top` on the `.outer` or `ul` element.

Because of the perpendicular margin decay in these cases, defining border colors, such as background images, or defining an inner padding that is not visible, will ensure that the outer margin is applied correctly.

Of course, it depends on the design, but unless you have to give an outer margin, you can solve it with the inner margin, but it is configured as above to deal with the vertical margin merging phenomenon.

An example of no margin decay in the outer margin between float elements.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="310" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/AXwzWX?height=310&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=AXwzWX&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_AXwzWX"></iframe>

The above code has two plot elements, each plot element has a top margin, and the parent element has another top margin applied to the plotted parent element to give more space to the paragraph (to illustrate).

In this case, there is no vertical margin decay.
