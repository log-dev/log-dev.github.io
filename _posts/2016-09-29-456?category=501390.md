mouseover vs mouseenter

This post explores the difference between mouseover events and mouse entertainment events.

The difference between mouseover and mouseenter is in event bubbleing.

Let`s take a look at the following source views:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="746" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/EymoOk?height=746&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=EymoOk&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_EymoOk"></iframe>

If you raise and lower the mouse over the orange and pink areas above, it will cause mouse over and mouse entertainment events.

The mouseover event is an event where event bubbleing is applied, so it will occur again even if it is inside the div tag.

On the other hand, the mouseenter event only takes place once because it only considers whether it is inside or outside the document object.
