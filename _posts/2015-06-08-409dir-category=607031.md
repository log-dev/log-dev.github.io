### white-space

Sets a value indicating whether the line is automatically broken inside. This property is inherited.

```css
p {white-space: nowrap;}

```

- Normal: The default changes the character line automatically. If the content exceeds the width of the element, it changes to the next line.
- Nowrap: Wrap does not run. The content does not change to the next line.
- pre : line breaks and other spaces are maintained. This possible value is!It is supported when the DOCTYPE declaration specifies the standard compliance mode. If the !DOCTYPE declaration does not specify a standard compliance mode, this value can be retrieved, but it does not affect rendering and behaves like a normal value.
- Pre-line: The line break sequence is maintained.
- Pre-wrap: The line break sequence is reduced.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

### word-break

A property added to CSS3, which specifies a line change method based on words.

p.test {word-break: break-all;}

```

- Normal: Separate words according to the usual rules.

### word-spacing

Sets the additional spacing between words.

```css
p {word-spacing: 30px;}

```

- Negative values can be specified.

- normal : default interval.
- Length: floating point numbers followed by absolute unit designators (cm, mm, in, pt, pc) or relative unit designators (em, ex, px).
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.wordSpacing="10px"

```

### word-wrap

Sets line break mode with attributes added to CSS3. This property is inherited.

```css
p.test {word-wrap: break-word;}

```

- This property differs from the white-space property, which enables or disables text line breaking. The word-wrap property only indicates whether or not line breaks are allowed to occur in the positions of words that are not permitted by the applicable language rules.

- normal : By default, content exceeds container boundaries.
- break-word: content goes to the next line and word line breaks occur if necessary.

```js
object.style.wordWrap="break-word"

```
