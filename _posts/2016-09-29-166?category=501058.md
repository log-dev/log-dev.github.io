For door, do-while door, break door, continue door

A repeating statement is used to allow an action (code) to run repeatedly, and the types of repeating statements are for, for, for, and for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for, for,

For statements and when statements can be converted to each other, so it is okay to choose either way when you create a repeating statement, but for statements that are often used when you know the number of iterations, and when statements are repeated according to conditions.

The difference between the statement when and the statement do-while is whether the condition is examined first or later, and the behavior is the same.

### For Moon

> It is usually used when the number of repetitions is known.
For the form and flow of the statement, see the figure below.

### WHILE DOOR

If the for statement repeats a specified number of times, the for statement repeats again and again when the condition expression is true.

The conditional expression usually comes with a comparison or logical operation, which stops the repetitive action and ends the when statement.

### do-while 문

The same statement is used to determine if you want to continue repeating based on the conditions.

However, run block {} of braces once unconditionally, and examine the conditions to determine the repeat.

For statement, when statement, and do-while statements are terminated. (Cancel repeat)

Exit switch statement.

### continue문

Use for statements, when, and do-while. If you encounter continue in the statement, you can move directly to the increasing and decreasing expression, and when, do-while statements are conditionally moved.
