At one point, the browser`s developer might have hoped that the temporary modifications to the tools would be saved immediately. Let me introduce the plug-in at the starting point.

### Emmet LiveStyle 소개

Emmet LiveStyle is a plug-in for editing CSSs in a new generation of real-time bidirectional (editor↔ browser). It currently works with Chrome, Safari and sublime text. The video above shows the most powerful features of LiveStyle. It also works with SASS/SCSS/LESS.

- Update immediately: Changes are reflected without having to save any files or reload pages.
- No local files are required.
- Cross-platform
- It supports multi-view and multi-device. Open the same page in another window and update them all immediately. For example, if you leave two browser windows in different sizes and modify one, both windows are reflected, making it convenient to devise a reactive design.
- It supports multi-site updates. For example, it shares CSS such as desktop and mobile versions, but can be edited in real time if it is a different website.
- Very easy installation: no complicated mapping or patterns required, just open one LiveStyle browser window and the CSS file associated with the editor.

### Emmet LiveStyle 설치

Below we discuss how to install the plug-in for Sublime Text and Chrome.

- After executing the sublime text, command Palette is recalled with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P.
- Select Package Control: Install Package, which is automatically completed when `install` is entered, and press Enter.
- When LiveStyle is detected by typing `live`, select it and press Enter to install it.

When you install this plug-in, it automatically downloads PyV8 binaries, but if you encounter problems downloading them, install them manually.

If you have already installed Emmett or TernJS extensions, update to the latest version. This is because it contains updates to LiveStyle.

It installs LiveStyle directly from the Chrome Web Store. When installed, the last panel called LiveStyle is added to the developer mode (F12).

For Safari extensions, see Safari extension.

### How to Use Emmet LiveStyle

To enable CSS editing in real time:

- It runs sub-lime text, opens a CSS file, or creates a new one.
- Visit the page you want to modify through the Chrome browser.
- Open the developer tool and enable Enable LiveStyle on the LiveStyle panel.
- When enabled, you can see a list of the external stylesheets on the left side of the page and a list of editor files on the right side. Simply selecting an editor file connects to one browser.

The editor`s list of files automatically checks and updates files that are created, opened, and closed by the editor every moment.

> Sometimes LiveStyle does not work. It is recommended that you open the console window (Ctrl + `) and check the error message and delete or correct the CSS syntax that is causing the problem.
