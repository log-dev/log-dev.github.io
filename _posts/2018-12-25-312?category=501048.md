JS Private Members and Privileged Methods

Unlike other languages, such as Java, JavaScript does not have a separate syntax for private, protected, public properties and methods.

All members of the object are public, that is, public.

### All members of the JavaScript object are public.

As mentioned above, all members of the object are usually public because there is no separate grammar unlike other languages.

Take a look at the following examples:

```js
var myObj = {
myProp : 1,
getProp: function () {
return this.myProp;
}
};
console.log(myObj.MyProp); // has public access to myProp.
console.log(myObj.getProp()); // getProp() is also public.
```

As with the object literal method, when you create an object using the constructor function, all members are also public.

```js
function Gadget() {
this.name = 'iPod';
this.stretch = function () {
return 'iPad';
};
}
var toy = new Gadget();
console.log (toy.name); // name is public.
The console.log (toy.stretch()); //stretch() method is also public.
```

### Private Members

In the example above, all are publicly available for external access to members of an object.

Then, can we not disclose it so that we can`t access the members of the object?

There is no grammar for private members, but it can be implemented using a closure.

When you create a closure within a constructor function, variables within the closure effective range are not exposed outside the constructor function, but can be written within the object`s public method.

That is, if you define a method for an object when it is returned by the constructor, you can access private variables within this method.

View the following example:

```js
function Gadget() {
// Private Members
var name = 'iPod';
this.getName = function () {
return name;
};
}

var toy = new Gadget();

// name is private, so undefined is printed.
console.log(toy.name);

// Public methods allow access to the name.
console.log(toy.getName()); // iPod
```

As you can see, you can easily implement private members in JavaScript.

All you have to do is wrap the data around it as a function to keep it private. If you make these data into region variables for a function, you cannot access them outside the function.

Privileged method

The concept of a privileged method is not related to a particular grammar.

It is just a name that refers to a public method that has access to a private member (i.e. some kind of privileged).

In the previous example, `getName()` is a privileged method because it has `special` access to the private property `name`.

Disclosure member`s loophole

If the privileged method returns the value of a private variable immediately, the value of the private variable can be modified in the external code, because if the variable is an object or array, it returns a reference, not a value.

The Gadget implementation that follows may not seem to be a problem.

```js
function Gadget() {
// Private Members
var specs = {
screen_width : 320,
screen_height : 480,
color : 'white'
};

// Public function
this.getSpecs = function () {
return specs;
};
}
```

The problem here is that the getSpecs() method is returning a reference to the specs object.

Specs looks like a hidden private member but may be changed by Gadget users.

```js
function Gadget() {
// Private Members
var specs = {
screen_width : 320,
screen_height : 480,
color : 'white'
};

// Public function
this.getSpecc = function () {
return specs;
};
}

var toy = new Gadget(),
specs = toy.getSpecc();

specs.color = 'black';
specs.price = 'free';

console.dir(toy.getSpecc());
// Private objects are modified as follows.
/**
* -------------------
* color: "black"
* price: "free"
* screen_height: 480
* screen_width: 320
* --------------------
*/
```

To solve these unexpected problems, you have to pay attention when passing references to objects or arrays that need to be kept private.

One way is to create a completely new object in getSpecs() and return it with only a fraction of the data that would be useful to the user.

This is also known as the Principle of Least Authority (POLA). It means that you should not give more authority than you need.

In the example above, if a Gadget user wants to know which box Gadget will fit in, then just tell them the area of the Gadget.

Then instead of giving out all the information, you can create a method called getDimensions() to return an object that contains only width and height.

With this implementation, the getSpecs() method might not have even been necessary to implement it at all.

### Object Literals and Private Members

So far, we`ve only looked at how to use the constructor to create private members.

So what if you created an object with object literature? In this case, can we implement a private member?

As we`ve seen so far, it just wraps private data as a function.

Therefore, object literal creates a closure by adding an anonymous immediate execution function.

Take a look at the following example:

```js
'var myObj;// I will assign objects to this variable.

(function(){
// Private Members
var name = 'My name is jaehee';

// implement parts to be disclosed.
// Be aware that you did not use var.
myObj = {
// Privileged method
getName : function () {

}
}

}());

myObj.getName(); // 'My name is jaehee'
```

The following example shows the same basic concepts but slightly different implementations.

```js
var myObj = (function () {
// Private Members
var name = 'My name is jaehee';

// implement parts to be disclosed.
return {
getName : function () {
return name;
}
}
}());

myObj.getName(); // My name is jaehee
```

### Prototype and Private Members

When you create a private member using the constructor, the disadvantage is that each time you invoke the constructor to create a new object, the private member is regenerated every time.

In fact, this problem always occurs when members are added to this inside the constructor.

To eliminate this redundancy and save memory, you must add common properties and methods to the prototype property of the constructor.

This ensures that all instances created with the same constructor share a common part. Hidden private members can also be shared by all instances.

This requires the use of two patterns: a pattern of creating private members inside the constructor function and a pattern of creating private members with object literals.

Because the prototype property is an object after all, so it can be created as an object literal.

Use the following example to learn.

```js
function Gadget() {
// Private Members
var name = 'iPod';

// Public function
this.getName = function () {
return name;
};
}

Gadget.prototype = (function () {
// Private Members
var browser = 'Mobile Webkit';

// published prototype members
return {
getBrowser : function () {
return browser;
}
}
}());

var toy = new Gadget();
console.log(toy.getName()); // privileged method of object instance
console.log(toy.getBrowser()); // privileged method of prototype'
```

### To expose a private function as a public method

An exposure pattern is an implementation of a private method while also exposing it as a public method.

All of the functions of the object are essential to what the object does, so maximum protection is needed, and at the same time, due to the usefulness of these functions, you may want to allow public access.

Exposure patterns can be useful in such cases. And the fact that the method is public means that it is endangered.

Public API users may unintentionally modify the method.

ECMAScript 5 has the option to freeze objects, but not in lower versions.

Now we`re going to learn about exposure patterns.

The term was coined by Christian Heimann and was initially referred to as the `revealing module pattern`.

Let`s take a look at the examples first.

This example is based on a pattern of creating private members within an object literal.

```js
var myArray;

(function(){
var arrStr = '[object Array]',
toString = Object.prototype.toString;

function isArray(a) {
return toString.call(a) === arrStr;
}

function indexOf(haystack, needle) {
var i = 0,
max = haystack.length;
for (; i < max; i += 1) {
if(haystack[i] === needle) {
return i;
}
}
return -1;
}

myArray = {
isArray : isArray,
indexOf : indexOf,
inArray : indexOf
}

}());
```

There are two private variables, two private functions, isArray() and indexOf().

If you look at the last part of the Immediate Action function, the functions that you decide are acceptable to allow public access are filled in the myArray object.

The private function indexOf() was exposed with two names: indexOf, the name of ECMAScript expression 5, and inArray, the name affected by PHP.

Now test the new myArray object.

```js
console.log(myArray.isArray([1, 2])); // true
console.log(myArray.isArray({0: 1})); // false
console.log(myArray.indexOf(['a', 'b', 'z'], 'z')); // 2
console.log(myArray.inArray(['a', 'b', 'z'], 'z')); // 2
```

Now, even if something unexpected happens to the public method indexOf(), inArray() will continue to work well because the private function indexOf() is secure.

```js
myArray.indexOf = null;
console.log(myArray.inArray(['a', 'b', 'z'], 'z')); // 2

```
