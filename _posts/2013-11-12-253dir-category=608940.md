Ajaxploer is an application that can connect storage in a variety of ways, including web hard, FTP, cloud, local disk connectivity, and samba connectivity. Currently, the name has been changed and is called pydio.

It is assumed that APM is installed before installation.

### Create MySQL DB and Add Users

pydio does not necessarily need SQL Server. It can also be used using a file system and is suitable for use by about 50 users. In my case, I do not add other users to the Ubuntu system, so I need to add new users using MySQL.

MySQL Connection

```bash
mysql -u root -p

```

creating Ajaxploer DB

```undefined
CREATE DATABASE ajaxploer;

```

Add DB user and set password (enter desired password in $password)

```undefined
GRANT ALL ON ajaxploer.* TO ajaxploer@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '$password';

```

MySQL Refresh

```undefined
flush privileges;

```

Exit mysql

```undefined
exit

```

### Download pydio

There is a method for downloading and downloading pydio from the web and installing it using apt-get by adding a repository, which is easy to use because it is easy to install.

Go to the location of the pydio installation

```bash
cd /var/www/cloud.uzuro.com/public_html

```

Download pydio

```bash
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/ajaxplorer/files/ajaxplorer/stable-channel/5.0.4/ajaxplorer-core-5.0.4.zip

```

decompress and rename

```bash
unzip ajaxplorer-core-5.0.4.zip
mv ajaxplorer-core-5.0.4 pydio

```

Change Owners and Change Permissions

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data.www-data pydio
sudo chmod -R 775 pydio

```

Set up and enable Apache virtual hosts. Set `AllowOverride All` to enable .htaccess.Skip this...

Browser connection (I set up https and set the path of DocumentRoot on the virtual host to /var/www/cloud.uzuro.com/public_html/pydio)

https://cloud.uzuro.com/

### Pydio Diagnostic Tool 설정

Before using the pydio, correct the part where the warning message occurred.

If Korean is included when downloading a folder, the solution is to break it.

Find the `$p_header[`flag`] = 0;` part of the core/classes/pclzip.lib.php file and set the value to 2048, as shown below. <

```php
$p_header['flag'] = 2048;

```
