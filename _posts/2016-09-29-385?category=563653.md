Mix-in with LESS variable

LESS is the extended language of CSS, which is compatible with CSS, as well as additional existing CSS syntax.

In this article, we will take some time to learn about variables and how to use mix-in LESS grammar.

### Variables

The LESS variable is marked with a `@` in front of the variable name. (@variables)

Let`s take a look at the following examples.

```css
@red: red;
@light-red: @red + #222; // operation
#header {
color: @light-red;
}

@friend : "I have a friends.";
@overVar : 'friend'; // see @friend variable as string to use it as another variable
.demo {
content: @@overVar; // @(@overVar) -> @('friend') -> @friend -> "I have a friends." 로 치환된다.
margin: 10px;
}
```

```css
#header {
color: #ff2222;
}
.demo {
content: "I have a friends.";
margin: 10px;
}
```

In LESS, a variable is defined only once at the time when document reading is completed, practically as constants.

In other words, it can only be defined once.

### Mixins (Mix-in)

In LESS, you can include multiple CSS attributes in one rule set and include them in another.

For example, let you define the following classes:

```css
.bordered {
border-top: dotted 1px black;
border-bottom: solid 2px black;
}
```

To use a class that contains these properties in another rule set, simply insert the class` name into the rule set that contains the properties you want to include:

```css
#menu a {
color: #111;
.bordered;
}
.post a {
color: red;
.bordered;
}
```

You can write `.bordered` where you want to use it.

```css
#menu a {
color: #111;
border-top: dotted 1px black;
border-bottom: solid 2px black;
}
.post a {
color: red;
border-top: dotted 1px black;
border-bottom: solid 2px black;
}
```

You can mix in the same way as above by writing with a CSS class or id rule.

Try using a mix-in from an existing style

```css
.a, #b {
color: red;
}
.demo-01 {
.a();
}
.demo-02 {
#b();
}
```

```css
.a, #b {
color: red;
}
.demo-01 {
color: red;
}
.demo-02 {
color: red;
}
```

Please note that parentheses are optional when calling mix-ins.

```css
'// These two sentences do the same thing.
.a();
.a;
```

Do not output mix-ins

The user wants to create a mix-in, but if the user does not need to print that mix-in, they can put parentheses after that.

The mix-in described above is compiled into CSS and output, which may be unnecessary if you only need a role as a mix-in.

Review the code below:

```css
My-mixin is printed.
.my-mixin {
// Mix-ins without parentheses are compiled.
color: black;
}

My-other-mixin is not output.
.my-other-mixin() {
// The parentheses mix-in is not output (compiled) to the css file.
background: white;
}

.demo {
.my-mixin;
.my-other-mixin;
}
```

```css
.my-mixin {
color: black;
}
.demo {
color: black;
background: white;
}
```

Mix-in selectors

Mix-ins can contain many attributes, as well as more selectors.

```css
.my-hover-mixin() {
```

```css
button:hover {
border: 1px solid red;
}
```

Namespaces

If you want to use more complex selectors internally for mixed attributes, you can build or inherit your ID or class in the way mentioned below with the CSS existing grammar.

```css
#outer {
.inner {
color: red;
}
}

.c {
#outer > .inner;
}
```

```css
#outer .inner {
color: red;
}
.c {
color: red;
}
```

In addition to writing methods (using >), such as `#outer > .inner;`, you can optionally use blank spaces.

The grammar below all have the same result.

```css
#outer > .inner;
#outer > .inner();
#outer .inner;
#outer .inner();
#outer.inner;
#outer.inner();
```

These uses are known as namespace. You can create a mix-in under the ID selector and avoid conflicts with other libraries by placing it under the ID selector.

Take a look at the following examples:

```css
#my-library {
.my-mixin() {
color: black;
}
}
// which can be used like this
.class {
#my-library > .my-mixin();
}
```

```css
.class {
color: black;
}

```

Guarded Namespaces

If the name space has a guard, it is only used if the mix-in guard condition defined by it returns true.

Guards

Guarding is useful if you find something that matches an expression, not just a value or number of factors.

This means that the protected namespace must be met before it can be used.

Let`s take a look at the following examples.

```css
@mode : huge;

#namespace when (@mode=huge) { // Mixed enabled when condition is true
.mixin() {
border: 1px solid darkblue;
padding: 10px;
}
}

.guardedNamespace {
#namespace > .mixin()
}
```

```css
.guardedNamespace {
border: 1px solid darkblue;
padding: 10px;
}
```

If the code does not define the top `@mode : huge;` corresponding to the condition `when(@mode = huge``, the mix-in will not be available and a compilation error will occur.

Because of the namespace guard, the following two mix methods work and are evaluated equally:

```css
#namespace when (@color = red) {
.mixin() {
padding: 10px;
}
}

#namespace {
.mixin() when (@color = red) {
padding: 10px;
}
}
```

The !important keyword

After mixing, write the !important keyword, and all attribute values will be `!`important` is inherited.

```css
.foo (@bg: #f5f5f5, @color: #900) {
background: @bg;
color: @color;
}
.unimportant {
.foo();
}
.important {
.foo() !important;
}
```

```css
.unimportant {
background: #f5f5f5;
color: #900;
}
.important {
background: #f5f5f5 !important;
color: #900 !important;
}
```

So far, we`ve learned about variables and mix-ins.

Mixin has only looked at the basic syntax, and we will discuss it further in the next posting.
