When I looked for WordPress translation plug-in, I was recommending a lot of plug-in called CodeStyle Localization. The problem is that at this point, the plug-in is not searched on WordPress. So I introduce Loco Translate as another alternative.

### Loco Translate 소개

The Loco Translate plugin allows WordPress plugins and themes to be translated by modifying the PO file directly from the browser. In other words, a translation file can be created directly from WordPress without having to install a translation program such as Poedit.

- Built-in translation editor in WordPress Manager
- You can modify or create language files directly on a theme or plug-in.
- We extract a translation string from the source code.
- MO files can be edited without Gettext on the system
- Support for PO features including comments, references and plural forms
- Can set up a backup of PO files
- Built-in wordpress area code

You can connect to your own WordPress and search for LocoTranslate in the plug-in to install it.

### Loco Translate FAQ

No, they need to manually enter their own translations using plug-ins, but they plan to provide some automatic translation services soon.

All Loco Translate does not run when people visit your site, but manages translation processing and organizes files.

If Loco is stored in the wrong MO file or in the wrong place, ask for support.

The extraction process uses a string literal argument such as `___(`Foo`)` in WordPress to find the string to translate.

It does not work with its own user-defined functions, such as `myTranslate (`Foo`)`. Variables such as `__($foo)` should not be used.

If you are not familiar with Gettext workflows and do not plan to deploy plug-ins, you can operate without POT files.

There is a good reason to keep the POT file, but it is not essential for Loco to operate. It can be translated directly into the source code and synchronized.

Some files and directories require write access to store PO files directly on the site. If you do not know how to manage file permissions on a server, contact your system administrator or hosting provider.

If a security problem occurs with a writable directory, it will restrict translation to the development server. File permissions are not related to editing and viewing translations.

Loco Translate compiles MO files in the same location each time a PO file is saved. If the compilation of the MO file fails, it should be checked to see if it can be written to disk.

This error means that there is something wrong with the server that is unexpected. Let`s check out some tips on what to do.

IE provides access to Windows interfaces, but IE9 and later are recommended.

Loco Translate does not support the Windows version of PHP, so the plug-in might not work properly if the server is a Windows version.

In most cases, it will work normally, but LocoTranslate is not a program that runs independently, which can sometimes cause problems due to external factors running on the server. Intervention may be necessary if the plug-in cannot automatically handle a particular situation. And there is no non-technical solution to the technical problem.

You can get support for problems with Loco Translate, but you must provide the relevant details.

### Loco Translate 설명

When the plug-in is installed, a new Loco Translate menu appears in the administrator panel.

If you look at this menu, it has blocks divided into themes and plug-ins.

- You can add a new language in the Translation File (PO) column, and if you already have a translated file, you can modify the translation using that link.
- The template itself can be modified using links in the template file (POT).
- You can use the link in File permissions to check the status and permissions of the related files.

> Oh no! Looking closely, only the theme and plug-in translation files can be modified. All I wanted was to modify the basic translation file for WordPress.

It is a menu for other settings.

### Example of Loco Translate translation

I decided to translate one plug-in. The plug-in User Access Manager is the target, and as you can see, there is no Korean translation and there is a warning message.

Once the warning message (some file missing) Let`s, go to the link.

- The first message seems to be that there is no Dutch translation file. I don`t need it. Pass!
- The second message is that the language directory cannot be found in that plugin directory, which has a separate directory called lang.
- The third message is that there is no "Text Domain" declared, which is clearly inferred. It`s right to guess.

We didn`t find any problems, so pass them all.

Add a new translation file using the "New language" button. You can choose the language of the translation file and choose where to save the file.

Choose the phrase you want and translate it. When the translation is complete, saving with the Save button automatically compiles the MO file and translates into effect.
