The background properties of CSS are used to define the background effects of elements. Please note that the content added from CSS3 may not be supported by older IE.

### background

축약형 속성으로 background-color, background-position, background-size, background-repeat, background-origin, background-clip, background-attachment, and background-image 순서로 작성한다. There is no problem to omit some of the values.

```css
/* background-image background-position [/background-size] repeat-style attachement box background-color */
h1 {background: url('img.gif') 50% /8em repeat-x fixed border-box blue; }

```

- IE8 and earlier versions do not support setting multiple background images on one element.
- The inherit value is not supported below IE7. IE8 requires !DOCTYPE. IE9 to support normally.

```js
object.style.background="red url(smiley.gif) top left no-repeat"

```

### background-attachment

Specifies how multiple background images separated by commas are scrolled.

```css
div {background-attachment: fixed;}

```

- scroll: The background is fixed to the element and scrolled with the document. This is the default value.
- fixed : fixed according to view port.
- local : inherits the content location of the element and scrolls with the content.

### background-clip

The property added to CSS3 defines the extended property for the background within the border.

```css
h1 {background-clip: content-box;}

```

- Border-box: Expand the border.
- Padding-box: Do not extend the border.
- content-box: expands content areas only.

By specifying padding-box values in the background-clip property, you can apply a transparent effect, such as jQuery`s lightbox script, as shown below.

### background-image

Specifies the image to be used in the background.

background: url(img_flwr.gif) bottom left no-repeat,
}

h1 {background-image: url(logo.png) no-repeat;}

```

- The box background can have multiple layers (multi-background).
- The background-image property can be separated by a comma to specify multiple layers.
- All values including the none value mean one layer.
- Each image layer can be sized and positioned, and can appear repeatedly depending on the attribute value of each background.
- The first specified image is shown close to the user.

### background-origin

The attributes added to CSS3 specify the relative position of the background image relative to the box.

```css
div {
background-image: url(img_flwr.gif);
background-origin: content-box;
}

```

- Border-box: Expand the border.
- Padding-box: Do not extend the border.
- content-box: expands content areas only.

This property does not apply if the background-attachment property value is specified as fixed.

- If only one keyword is specified, the second value is center.
- The default is the top left, i.e. 0 . You can use the percent value or the top left keyword.
- The percentage value and the position value may be mixed.
- The percentage value is the size of the location area of the background minus the size of the background image.

- left top / left center / left bottom / right top / right center / right bottom / right top / center top / center center / center bottom : Keyword attribute value is specified and the second value is center.

### background-size

The properties added to CSS3 store the original size within the location area of the background and size the area according to the property value.

```css
div {background-size: 80px 60px;}
h1 {background-size: cover;}

```

- Width height: The first value is the width value, and the second value is the height value. The values available for the width and height properties are auto, px, and %. If the second value is omitted, the auto value is applied.
- cover: We include the background image in the background area by magnifying the background image scale as much as possible. Parts of the background image may deviate from the background positional region.
- contain : inside the content area, both width and height adjust the size of the background image to the largest possible size.

### background-repeat

Specifies the recurrence pattern of the background.

```css
body {background-repeat: space;}

```

- repeat: The background repeats in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- repeat-x: The background repeats only in the horizontal direction.
- repeat-y: The background repeats only in the vertical direction.
- No-repeat: The background does not repeat.
- round: only as many iterations as are required to fill the background area. If the background region is not filled by the repetition of the image, the image is resized.
- space: only as many iterations as are required to fill the positional region of the background without image clipping, and space between the images is widened to fill the region. The first and last images appear at the edge of the region.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.
