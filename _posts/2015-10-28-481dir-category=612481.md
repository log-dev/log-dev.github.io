Earlier, we looked at Headroom.js, a plug-in for similar features, which may be difficult to cross-browse for older IE. This introduces snippets that are similar but can be easily implemented when the target element is clearly limited.

### Fixed header (navigation) inconvenience.

Many websites use CSS positioning to fix the top header (including navigation) to help navigate navigation. The header portion may be a factor in reducing the user experience of the site if most of the content contains a mutual (brand) and a fixed header contains long-height content because it contains navigation. This is all the more so for devices with small viewports such as mobile.

Rather than simply providing a fixed type of header design, the goal is to provide a design that fits the user`s intentions by showing or hiding the header parts according to the user`s scroll direction. In other words, if a user`s scroll is downward, it is considered to want to explore the content, and if the scroll is upward, it is considered to go back to the beginning or navigation to re-emerge the header part. This is what the original author calls a revolution.

### Understanding Principles

The main principle is to use CSS3 transitions and some JavaScript to achieve this effect.

- Set `position: fixed` on the header element.
- If the scroll direction is downward, the class is added to the header element and the header is disappeared up by this class.
- If the scroll direction is up, the added class is removed and the header element reappears.

### HTML Structure

The basic structure is as follows, but in fact, the header has a fixed value, so there is no problem with any structure that is beyond the influence of other places.

```html
<header></header>
<main></main>
<footer></footer>

```

### CSS Example

The basic CSS design is as follows, and you can modify it according to your design.

```css
body {
padding-top: 40px; // Allow margin by header height
}

header {
position: fixed;
top: 0;
left: 0;
width: 100%;
height: 40px;
background: #f5b335;
transition: top 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

// Class to be added as JavaScript
.nav-up {
Top: -40px; // Same height as header.
}

```

> The contents of the original text are the same as above, but various animations can be applied to give a smooth effect. In addition, rather than simply controlling the location movement with transitions, the combination of transformation and transition can achieve a natural effect on various devices.

### Implement JavaScript

Insert jQuery into the document.

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>

```

Before implementing the code, I would like to mention that detecting and acting on scroll events has a significant impact on performance. To address this problem, instead of implementing the behavior for all the pixels that are scrolled, the user is checking the scrolling interval.

```undefined
var didScroll;
// When scrolling, notify the user that the user has scrolled
$(window).scroll(function(event){
didScroll = true;
});

// run hasScrolled() and reset the DidScroll state
setInterval(function() {
if (didScroll) {
hasScrolled();
didScroll = false;
}
}, 250);

function hasScrolled() {
// Implement Actions
}

```

`$(window).It detects a scroll event by `scroll` and sets the variable value of `idScroll` to true. Check the variable value of didScroll every 250 ms to implement the action and set the variable value of didScroll to false again. Setting a variable is a way to reduce the load on the browser rather than implementing a full action every time it is scrolled.

### Hide Header

Hide the header when it meets the requirements below.

- When scrolling more than the value of `delta`
- If you scroll more than the height of the header,
- When scrolling up or down
- Store current scroll position in variable

Let`s set the variable value at the top of the script.

```undefined
var lastScrollTop = 0;
var delta = 5; // where the action begins to be implemented
var navbarHeight = $('header').outerHeight(); // select the element to be affected

```

Store the location of the current scroll for easy access.

```undefined
var st = $(this).scrollTop();

```

Verify that it is scrolling more than the delta value you set.

```undefined
if (Math.abs(lastScrollTop â€” st) <= delta)
return;

```

Verify that the height of the header is more than the height and that the direction of the scroll is up or down.

```undefined
// If current position > last position AND scrolled past navbar...
if (st > lastScrollTop
```

Specifies the current scroll position in `lastScrollTop`.

```undefined
lastScrollTop = st;

```

### Completed JavaScript code

```undefined
// Hide Header on on scroll down
var didScroll;
var lastScrollTop = 0;
var delta = 5;
var navbarHeight = $('header').outerHeight();

$(window).scroll(function(event){
didScroll = true;
});

setInterval(function() {
if (didScroll) {
hasScrolled();
didScroll = false;
}
}, 250);

function hasScrolled() {
var st = $(this).scrollTop();

// Make sure they scroll more than delta
if(Math.abs(lastScrollTop - st) <= delta)
return;

// If they scrolled down and are past the navbar, add class .nav-up.
// This is necessary so you never see what is "behind" the navbar.
if (st > lastScrollTop
```

> Similar to the behavior introduced above, various results can be made such as reducing height or making other changes without completely hiding header elements. There are many snippets floating around and will be accessible by search. The key is the addition and removal of classes tailored to the scroll direction.
