JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming

### Class-based object-oriented techniques

From a program-writing methodology perspective, JavaScript is a language that supports both procedural programming, function-oriented, and object-oriented programming, which considers everything an object to be an object-oriented programming method.

Object-oriented programming languages are also divided into class-based programming and prototype-based programming. JavaScript supports prototype-based object-oriented programming.

In class-based languages, objects are created using classes and inheritance is supported based on classes, but in prototype languages, objects are created using prototypes that are circular to objects, and inheritance is also based on prototypes.

In general, object orientation refers to class-based object orientation.

We briefly summarize the characteristics of class-based object orientation. Often a class-based object-oriented language should have the following characteristics:objects, methods, properties (Object, method, property)

> - Class
- Encapsulation
- Aggregation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

It is necessary to study JavaScript while focusing on how to implement these object-oriented features with JavaScript.

Let`s take a quick look at the concepts above.

### Object

Objects are very important, as the name object-oriented implies.

Everything that exists in the world is an object. Objects can be real or convoluted conceptual.

The world consists of many objects (people, wooden objects, stone objects, water objects, and animal objects), and the world revolves as they interact.

The programming world also employs concepts such as objects in the general world.

Thus, object-oriented languages were able to represent these objects and to represent programming by defining the world`s components, objects, as "state" and "behavior".

For example, a cat (an animal object) is an object that has four legs (state), has fur (state), meow meow (meow) and can jump high.

In object orientation, states are called properties and actions are called methods.

That is, all objects consist of attributes and methods.

In object orientation, both attributes and methods are called members of an object.

### Class

In the real world, similar objects can be grouped based on some criteria. Sparrows and eagles are both birds.

Therefore, both species of birds belong to a class called Bird, and real sparrows and eagles correspond to special objects in each bird.

In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, a frame, or a recipe for creating objects, and the same class can be used to create different objects.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is another concept associated with object-oriented programming, indicating that an object-oriented language can include (encapsulate) related attributes and methods as one object.

The concept that comes with encapsulation is information concealment.

For example, gas stove users are offered several buttons. The light turns on when the button is pressed.
But we don`t know what`s going on inside. In other words, how gas stove is implemented is hidden from users.

The same thing happens when an externally exposed method or property is used in code. In external usage code, it does not matter whether the developer has implemented it by coding directly or by using a third-party library.

Code using objects internally is a method, and there is no need to know how properties work.

Compilation languages such as C# and Java generally do not read the internal code of the object.

However, the JavaScript language is an interpreter language, so you can read its internal code.

However, the concepts of encapsulation and information concealment are the same.

In other words, we can only work with the properties and methods that the object exposes, regardless of how the object is implemented.

In object orientation, internal implementations can be hidden, as well as methods and attributes themselves can be exposed or hidden outside.

This is another feature of information concealment: in general languages, there are modifiers such as public, private, and protected, which can define the level of access to attributes and methods externally.

For example, if you want access only from within an object, you can define it as private, and if you want access from any code outside, you can define it as public.

In JavaScript, all methods and attributes are defined as public. However, there is a way to implement private features.

### Aggregation

Combining several objects together to create a single object is called an aggregation or compositon.

These collective concepts are a way to separate problems into smaller, more manageable parts.

For example, suppose you design an object called a computer.

Rather than designing an entire computer at once, it would be more efficient to analyze and design it in more depth, one by one, and then put it back together later (divide) by dividing it into parts such as monitor objects, mouse objects, and keyboard objects.

In object-oriented languages, these divisions/conquisitions are:

JavaScript, as well as other object-oriented languages, basically supports this set of features.

### Inheritance

Inheritance in object-oriented programming is a good way to reuse existing code or expand existing code.

For example, you create an object (class) called Person and have a name, birthdate, walk, talk, sleep, and eat as properties.

But let`s say that over time, you need a more specific Korean, even though you are a person in the program.

Of course, all the attributes and methods that the person has can be re-implemented in Korean and more attributes or methods that need to be added in Korean (e.g., methods such as SpeakInKorean).

However, it would be more efficient in terms of reuse of existing code if you try to inherit all the attributes and methods that you have and add more attributes and methods that Korean needs.

When an object inherits another object, a new method or property is usually added.

To express this, we also call it "extend" instead of "inherit".

In some cases, the parent`s methods and properties are redefined while inheriting the parent object.

That is, the method name and property name are the same, but calling the method or property of the child object will work in a different way.

Redefining these inherited members is called overriding.

Normal object-oriented languages support class-level inheritance, but JavaScript does not.

Instead, it supports object-level inheritance using prototypes.

### Polymorphism

There is a Person object in the article above (inheritance part). Suppose you have created a Korean object that inherits all the attributes and methods of the Person object.

That is, both the Person object and the Korean object provide a "talk" method, but the implementation of the "talk" method provided by the Person and the "talk" method provided by the Korean may differ.

While writing the code, the variable Jaehee can be assigned a Person object or an object named Korean.

Since both objects have a method called "talk", calling Jaehee the "talk" method will cause the code to work.

Even if you call a method with this same name, it is called polymorphism that different methods are executed depending on the object that is actually called.

(Different methods run depending on whether it is a Person object or a Korean object)

When cleaned up, polymorphism refers to the ability of multiple objects to respond to the same method call.

The programmer or program does not need to know what the actual object is.
