Tested in Ubuntu 12.04.02

### Ubuntu Desktop Network Settings

In Ubuntu desktop versions, a package called Network Manager has a higher priority than any other network setting. This means that modifying `/etc/resolv.conf` or `/etc/network/interfaces` directly does not reflect it and the value specified in the network manager is applied.

Let`s search for network or network from dash home and find and run network tools.

These are the network-related values currently specified by the wire. Click the option in the bottom right to open a wired connection window.

You can control various values by selecting the IPv4 Settings tab of the wired window.

- Method (M) : DHCP (Automatic IP Allocation) / Manual (Fixed IP) can be selected.
- Address: If it is manual, the IP address can be assigned directly using the Add button.
- DNS Server : You can specify a DNS server. Use commas (,) when specifying multiple.

Other desired values can be set across each tab. Basically, the above settings alone do not cause any problems in network operation. Press the Save button and restart the network using the On/Off button in the upper right corner of the wired window.

### Ubuntu Server Network Settings

The Ubuntu server version, like other Linux distributions, can be modified to various editors and is immediately reflected. However, `/etc/resolv.conf` that manages DNS servers can cause problems, so `/etc/network/interfaces` should designate a name server.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces

# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
# auto eth0
# iface eth0 inet dhcp

# menual
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 192.168.0.20
netmask 255.255.255.0
netwrok 192.168.0.0
broadcast 192.168.0.255
gateway 192.168.0.1

dns-nameservers 168.126.63.1 168.126.63.2 8.8.8.8

```

A static IP was assigned to the part directly set by the # manual or lower part of the code above. By default, two lines below # The primary network interface are set to default, which works in dhcp mode. Annotated and set to the desired value.

Restart the network and apply it.

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

```

Blow the ping to check if it is working properly.

```bash
$ ping -c 5 www.yahoo.co.kr

```

### Ubuntu's stance on resolve file changes

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/foundations-p-dns-resolving

The management of `/etc/resolv.conf` was changed to `resolveconf` due to the points described in the link above. With the introduction of resolvconf, resolvconf overwrites its own value even if manually set to /etc/resolv.conf.

Instead, resolvconf uses the DHCP client hook to set up the network manager plug-in and the name servers and domains specified in the /etc/network/interfaces file in /etc/resolv.conf.

Q: Where should I set DNS settings when I set up and use static IP?

A : DNS settings can be set in /etc/network/interfaces in the following ways:

```undefined
dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8
dns-search xxxx.com
dns-domain xxxx.com

```

Q: How do I add settings directly to resolvconf?

A : resolvconf has the path `/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/` and can have base, head, original, and tail files.

The setup method is the same as the method in resolv.conf, and below is a description of each file.

- base - used when no other setup files are found.
- The DNS server used in the header of the head - resolv.conf file can always be used to verify that it is the first in the list.
- Original - Resolvconf is a backup of the previous resolve.conf when installed.
- It is added to the end of the tail - resolv.conf file.
