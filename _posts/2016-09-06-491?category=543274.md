The advent and background of HTML5

As most people know, HTML is the key technology that supports the web.

And if you want to choose the core technology from mobile web, it is definitely `HTML5`.

We often agree that Steve Jobs` comments regarding Flash are the beginning of HTML5`s explosive interest.

`HTML5` is a new version of HTML and is a markup language that is central to Client Side Technology technology.

Most notably, traditional Web documents were unable to configure Web services with HTML only, but HTML5 allowed them to communicate with clients and servers, and added additional features to provide Web services without using plug-ins such as other external Active-X.

HTML5 is a technology that has evolved simple representation HTML that strongly supports Client Side Technology into a higher dimension to have more meaning.

In other words, existing HTML has been developed into HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 by W3C since HTML 4.0, but HTML5 has been created to overcome the limitations of HTML.

With the advent of HTML5, the extension and combination of functions through CSS3, JavaScript API has given more meaning than traditional HTML, and web standards and web accessibility are enhanced by removing the dependence on external technologies such as existing Active-X plug-ins.

And in Korea, the government and large companies have also recently moved to refrain from excessive use of Active X and encourage Web standards.

In particular, banks are actively introducing so-called "open banking" that allows users to use Internet financial services in other web browsers without the installation of Active X.

The new Web standard documentation specification "HTML5" is a way to overcome ActiveX`s problems, and websites developed with HTML5 standards can display web pages equally, even with different web browsers or operating systems, and can be designed and produced to play music or videos on their own without installing plug-ins like ActiveX.

HTML5 Concepts and Features

HTML5 is a "web programming language" that was established as the next-generation web standard (October 28, 2014) and evolved to allow HTML, which used to display only existing text and hyperlinks, to express and provide various applications, including multimedia.

For example, by providing various functions such as audio, video, graphics processing, and location information, the web itself has greatly improved its capabilities.

※ HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a programming language used to create web documents.

### Highlights of HTML5

HTML5 has the following characteristics that are different from conventional HTML:

- `Device Access DEVICE ACCESS` : H/W functions such as cameras and motion sensors are directly controlled from the web
- `CONNECTIVITY (Web Socket) : Web (Client) enables direct two-way communication with server side
- `3D, GRAPHICS
- `Style Effects (CSS3) : Various styles and effects such as font, color, background, etc.
- `MULTIMEDIA` : Supports video and audio functions on its own
- `OFFLINE
- `Geo-Location`: Provides geographical location information of devices without GPS
- `SEMANTICS` : Provide customized searches tailored to users` intentions by attaching meaning to web materials

And there is a compatibility principle in HTML5 design.

HTML5 Design Principles: Compatibility

- Compatibility of content: Content produced in versions prior to HTML5 should be available without problems.
- Compatibility with older browsers: HTML5 should also be available in older browsers that are not supported.
- Compatibility of methods of use: Traditional HTML tag usage should be made available as much as possible.
- Reuse of features: features that are only available in each browser should be integrated and available in common.
- Advances rather than innovations: HTML5 does not implement a new language, making it easier to reconstruct HTML that is already in use.

Although these design principles are being established, HTML5 is an undecided recommendation that we believe will follow them all in the future.

Expressing HTML5 in a sub-browser

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>HTML5</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./css/style.css">
// For use on the web
<!--[if IE]>
<script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
<![endif]-->

// Download and use the associated JavaScript file.
<!--[if IE]><script src="../js/html5.js"></script><![endif]-->
</head>
```

### Changed Browser Phase - The Browser Becoming a Platform

The key points of HTML5 conversion we`ve seen so far are related to increasing the functionality of the browser.

Because the browser already functions at the top, there is a view that the browser is not just a viewer that shows the data, but a platform that can run the program.

The easy way to describe a platform is to compare it to an operating system called Windows, so you can run a program like MS Office, which means that if you just provide the data you need for a platform called a browser, it works on a browser like an application.

In other words, the idea that a program considers a created HTML page to be a program and that the operating system in which it runs is considered a browser is the core of HTML5.

Operating System Compatibility and HTML Specification

If HTML pages are considered programs, existing browser types can be compared to various operating systems.

Just as operating systems vary, such as Linux, Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, browsers include IE, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Opera.

Since the HTML page is a program, browsers running it now need to implement common features for compatibility, which is the `Spec` of HTML5.

These are the features that the browser should implement the key features of HTML5, which will complete the true specification of HTML5 if they are built compatibly.

HTML4 vs HTML5

The differences between HTML4 and HTML5 can be largely divided into three categories: Syntax, Language, and API, and we will take a quick look at the content of syntax, language, and API.<

### Syntax

Let`s take a look at the following HTML5 documents.

```undefined
<!doctype html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>HTML5 Document type</title>
</head>
<body>
<!-- Content Area -->
</body>
</html>
```

DOCTYPE

Document types are much simpler than traditional HTML document types.

When creating HTML5 documents, DOCTYPE must be created at the top and must not contain any opening characters (enter).

DOCTYPE has two types: "HTML" and "XHTML" and can declare at the beginning whether to write HTML or XHTML when creating HTML5 documents.

In other words, HTML5 followed by HTML5 followed by HTML5 followed by XML followed by HTML5 could be defined as XHTML5.

Encoding

The following code is for Charset, or Encoding, which was used by existing document types.

```undefined
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
```

The following is the character set part of HTML5.

```undefined
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```

Compared to the existing character set, you can see that it has also become very simple.

Use of Graphic Language

In HTML5, you can use MathML, a formal technical language, SVG, etc.

```undefined
<!doctype html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
<div>
<svg> <circle r="50" cx="50" cy="50" fill="green"/> </svg>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

And when HTML5 markup is done, TAG is not case sensitive.

However, it is recommended to write in lowercase letters because it is recommended to comply with legibility aspects or existing development patterns.

### Language

You can learn more about the difference between HTML4 and HTML5 in terms of language.

For example, let`s look at the new Element, Attribute, Changed Element, Attribute, and Missing Element, Attribute.

New Element

The newly added element has a particularly semantic component.

The following table is a newly added `Semantic Element`.

| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |

Semantic elements can be marked up as follows:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/22560D4A57CE635B0E)

These new Semantic Elements transformed the vague and meaningless contents that were divided into existing Div Tags into more useful information.

Several additional Elements have been added.

New Attribute

Among the newly added attributes are the following attributes:

Changed Element

| |
| |
| |
| |

| |
| |
| |
| |

Changed Attribute

The properties below are not recommended for use and are only available where necessary.

Missing Element

If you look at the reasons for the Removed Element, there are three main reasons:

- Element that can be processed with CSS
- Frame 관련 Element
- Seldom-used Element

The next Element disappeared because it is an Element that is purely visible and can be processed with CSS.

basefont, big, center, font, strike, u 등...

The following Element is an Element related to Frame, which has been removed due to its negative impact on usability and accessibility.

frame, frameset, noframes

The following elements are removed because they are not frequently used, can be confusing, or can replace functions with other elements.

acronym, applet, isindex, dir

### API(Application Programing Interface)

The following are APIs designed for new use.

- Video/Audio API: It can be used to play video and audio along with Video and Audio Element.
- Offline Web Application: literally an API that supports Offline.
- APIs for Web Application to register specific protocols or media types
- Edit API used in conjunction with the new Grobal Attribute, "Contentible" Attribute
- Drag used with "draggable" Attribute
- API to expose history information used in navigation

And we expanded the existing API as below.

HTMLDocumnet Extensions

DOM Level2 HTML 의 HTMLDocument interface 를 확장

- `getElementsByClassName()`: Element can be selected with Class Name.
- `innerHTML` is an easy way to analyze and serialize HTML or XML documents.
- `active Element` and `hasFocus` : Check whether Element is currently Focus or Document is Focus.
- `getSelection(): Returns the currently selected object.

HTMLElenemt Extensions

HTML5`s HTML Element interface has several extensions.

- `getElementsByClassName()`
- `innerHTML`
- `ClassList` is an accessor that can easily access ClassName.
To manipulate the classes in Element, it exposes functions such as has(), add(), remove(), and toggle().

### Conclusion

We`ve learned about HTML5 so far, and we`ve seen the difference between HTML4 and HTML4.

I can`t understand everything, but I think it`s only necessary to understand the basics, that is, the things you use a lot, but you need to be more careful when you need them or when you need them or when you use them.
