CSS Unit (7 units of CSS)

Using the CSS technology that we know well can be easy and simple, but it can be difficult to solve when faced with a new problem.

The web is always growing, changing, and new solutions are growing.

That`s why we know that web designers and front-end developers have no choice but to take advantage of the know-how they have acquired.

It also means that even if you know a special method and don`t use it once, you can apply the exact method to practice when you need it someday.

In this article, I would like to learn about some previously unknown CSS methods.

Some numerical units are similar to pixels or em, but let`s look at other ways.

### rem(root em)

Let`s start with a unit that`s a little familiar to you, em defines the current font-size.

For example, specifying font size using em value on body tag will affect the font size of body.

```undefined
<body>
<div class="test">Test</div>
</body><
```

```css
body {
font-size: 14px;
}
div {
font-size: 1.2em; // calculated at 14px * 1.2, or 16.8px
}
```

Here, `font-size` is designated as `1.2em` in the div. In this example, a font size of 1.2 times is expressed based on 14px.

This results in a size of `16.8px`.

By the way, what would happen if we declared the font size defined here as em to each child?

I added the same code that applied the same CSS.

Each div inherits the font size of each parent and gets bigger and bigger.

```undefined
<div>
Test (14 * 1.2 = 16.8px)
<div>
Test (16.8 * 1.2 = 20.16px)
<div>
Test (20.16 * 1.2 = 24.192px)
</div>
</div>
</div>
```

See the Pen

This may be desirable in some cases, but in most cases, it is simply expressed in a single size.

In this case, you can use the units of rem immediately.

The "r" of `rem` means `root`.

Based on what you specify for the top-level tag (element), usually the top-level tag is the html tag.

```css
html {
font-size: 14px;
}
div {
font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```

The three divs of complex steps created in the previous example will all be expressed in font sizes of `16.8px`.

This unit is also useful for grid systems.

Rem is not used only in the font.

For example, you can use a grid system or a UI style based on a default font size using rem, and em to specify a special size for a particular location.

It will make it possible to adjust font size or size more accurately.

```css
.container {
width: 70rem; /* 70 * 14px = 980px */
}
```

Conceptually, this idea is similar to an interface strategy that can adjust your content size. However, you do not necessarily have to follow this approach in all cases.

The compatibility of the units of rem (rootem) can be found at caniuse.com.

### vh

Reactive web design techniques rely heavily on percentage values.

However, the percentage value of CSS is not a good way to solve all problems. The width value of the CSS is relative to the nearest parent element.

What if the width and height values of the target element can be used to match the width and height values of the viewport?

The units of `vh` and `vw` are the units that fit such intentions, and the element of vh is one hundredth of the height value.

For example, when the browser height value is 900px, 1vh means 9px. Similarly, if the viewport has a width value of 750px, 1vw is 7.5px.

There are endless ways of using this rule.

For example, when you create a slide with a maximum height value or a similar height value, you only need to enter a very simple CSS.

```css
.slide {
height: 100vh;
}
```

Suppose you create a headline that fills the width of the screen.

Specifying font size with vw is easy to achieve.

The size will change according to the width of the browser. (Browser size increased and decreased) Try it)

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="345" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/NNZGPZ?height=345&amp;theme-id=dark&amp;slug-hash=NNZGPZ&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_NNZGPZ"></iframe>

The compatibility in viewport vw, vh units can be found at caniuse.com.

### vmin

If `vh` and `vw` are always relative to the width and height values of the viewport, `vmin` and `vmax` can specify the maximum and minimum values depending on the width and height values.

For example, when the browser is 1100px wide and 700px high, `1vmin` becomes 7px and `1vmax` becomes 11px.

When the width value becomes 800px again and the height value becomes 1080px, vmin becomes 8px and vmax becomes 10.8px.

What do you think, can I use these prices?

Suppose you always create elements that are shown on the screen.

Specify the height and width values as 100 using `vmin`.

For example, this is how you define a square element that fills both sides of the touch screen.

```css
.box {
height: 100vmin;
width: 100vmin;
}
```

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/24305748573D314005)

If you need to be visible on the viewport screen (all four sides are full on the screen) like a cover, you can apply the same value as vmax.

```css
.box {
height: 100vmax;
width: 100vmax;
}
```

By combining these rules well, you can adjust the size in a very flexible way that fits the viewport.

Per viewport: vmin, vmax compatibility is available at caniuse.com.

Remind : vw, vh, vmin, vmax

A length value based on the Viewport, which sets the size based on the size of a document or part of a mobile device that you can see.

The full name of each property is as follows:

- Viewport Width (VW): equal to 1% length of viewport width.
- Viewport Height (VH): Same length as 1% of viewport height.
- Viewport Minimum (VMIN) : Minimum value based on viewport width or height.
- Viewport Maximum (VMAX) : Maximum value based on viewport width or height.

The value of vmin, vmax is dynamically set based on the width of the viewport, the length of the height, `small` or `large`.

For example, if you have a viewport of size 1000 × 500, the value of 1vmin is calculated as 5px and the value of 1vmax is calculated as 10px.

When the size changes to 1200 × 570, 1vmin becomes 5.7px and 1vmax becomes 12px.

That is, the units that change relative to the screen size are viewports.

### ex

`ex` and `ch` units are similar to em and rem in that they depend on current font and font size.

The difference between em and rem is that if these two units depend on `font-family`, the other two units are based on certain numbers in the font.

The units of `ch`, or font units, are defined as the "advanced scale" of the zero-character width value.

Interesting comments can be found on Eric Meyer`s blog. However, the default concept is that the width value of N in the monospace font is given, and `width: 40ch;` means it contains 40 strings.

This particular rule is based on braille layout, but the possibility of this technology can extend beyond simple applications.

The definition of ex units is "the `x-height value` of the current font or half the value of em." The `x-height value` is also the height value of the lowercase letter x.

This is a method that is frequently used to find the middle point of the font.

x-height values; lowercase x-height values (see Anatomical Links in Web typography for more information)

This unit is used a lot when making detailed adjustments in typographic.

For example, if the superscript tag `sup` has the position relative and the bottom value is 1ex, you can raise it up.

The subscripts below can also be lowered in a similar way.

The browser defines the default values for upper and lower subscripts as `vertical-align`, but if you want to know more sophisticated usage, you can write as follows:

```css
sup {
position: relative;
bottom: 1ex;
}
sub {
position: relative;
bottom: -1ex;
}
```

Availability

ex has been a unit since CSS1, and ch units cannot be found yet.

You can see more details in the CSS units and values on Eric Meyer`s blog.

### at the end

Keep an eye on the infinite expansion of your powerful CSS tools and the ongoing development environment.

Perhaps we can use these ambiguous units as an unexpected solution to solve a particular problem.

Please invest your time on new specifications.
