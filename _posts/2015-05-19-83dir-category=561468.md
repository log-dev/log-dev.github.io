### Introduction to CSS3PIE

PIE makes several useful CSS decorative attributes available for rendering in IE6â€“9.

- border-radius
- box-shadow
- border-image
- multiple background images
- linear-gradient as background image

In addition, PIE adds support for the `border-image` and `linear-gradient` properties to IE9, which already supports other functions by default.

### CSS3PIE Usage

Download the file using the above download, unzip it, and upload it to the web server.

Below you will find out how to apply rounded edges. First of all, `border-radius` properties are applied in a general way.

```css
#myAwesomeElement {
border: 1px solid #999;
-webkit-border-radius: 10px;
-moz-border-radius: 10px;
border-radius: 10px;
}

```

Apply the PIE.

```css
behavior: url(path/to/pie_files/PIE.htc);

```

The path portion above is relative to the HTML file being viewed, not the path from which the CSS file was invoked.

Let`s check the demo and examples.

The server must have a setting for content-type for the .htc file.

```undefined
AddType text/x-component .htc

```
