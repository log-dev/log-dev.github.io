Responsive YouTube Video

Media, such as YouTube, are added by controlling fixed heights and widths, which can be a problem if you need to resize them according to the size of your browser or the width of your device.

In other words, when you add a typical YouTube source code from a reactive web, you`ll face unwanted challenges on your mobile, tablet, or desktop.

Here`s a quick look at how the responsive web handles media such as YouTube videos.

### Typical Markup Structure

When you insert a YouTube video, you can do the following markups.

```undefined
<div class="video-container">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dFVxGRekRSg" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe>
</div>
```

As shown above, when inserting a YouTube source into an eyeframe, you need elements such as a parent container that wraps around the eyeframe.

### CSS Configuration

```css
.video-container {
position: relative;
padding-bottom: 56.25%;
padding-top: 30px;
height: 0;
overflow: hidden;
}

.video-container iframe,
.video-container object,
.video-container embed {
position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;
width: 100%;
height: 100%;
}
```

Among the styles above, `padding-bottom: 56.25%` is based on the ratio.

For example, given that the most common screen ratio, "16: 9", would be (9/16) * 100% = 56.25%.

The height value is set using padding-bottom without giving height: 0 to the container element surrounding the media element.

Next, set the absolute location value on the media element to specify the attribute values to fill the wrapped parent element.

By any chance, you can add `padding-top` to the parent element of the media so that the ratio of the screen does not match or that is suitable for each design situation.

In other words, fine adjustments to height values can be made using `padding-top`.

Here, the screen ratio was set at 16:9, but you can calculate percentage (%) at the rate appropriate for the design situation such as 4:3, 2:1.
