The `transform` effect is also interesting, but when combined, such as the transition functionality of CSS3, it gives greater effectiveness and vitality.

The dictionary meaning of `transition` means `transition, fulfillment`, but it is easy to understand that it means `screen movement`.

# Transition Overview

You can say that transition refers to the state of the middle of the transformation.

In other words, the state during a transformation is called screen movement, and you can specify a time for it.

For example, if you want to cause some variation when you over-react the mouse, you can think of it as using it to control the condition.

## Precautions and Familiarity with Transition

To use transition, you must be familiar with the following:

![image](https://developer.mozilla.org/files/4529/TransitionsPrinciple.png)

I need two styles.

The first style is the element`s "Initial State" and the second style is the element`s "End State".

For example, suppose a user mouseover a button, if the design before mouse-up is red button color and changes to blue when mouse-up, the web browser has a gradual screen shift (transfer) effect from the style before mouse-over (initial state) to the style of mouse-over (termination state).

To whom the transition property should be applied

The transition property creates an animation effect, and it is common to define what this property applies to the initial state style in the design.

Trigger to generate animation effects

The role of the trigger is to cause changes between the two styles in the initial and end states.

In CSS, animation can be started using several virtual classes, the most widely used is the `:over` class.

Virtual classes such as `:active` (with element clicked), `:target` (with element as the destination of link), and `:focus` (with tab moved focus to link or form field clicked) can also be used as triggers.

You can also use javascript to dynamically change the style of any tag.

When the trigger is no longer in effect, i.e. when the user overwrites the mouse over the button and then overcomes (out) above the button, the browser reverts the tag style to its initial state, while animation the process of moving the screen.

In other words, the screen movement effect only needs to be applied to the element once, and the browser will take care of the process of going from the initial state style to the exit state style and restoring it again.

### javaScript VS CSS Transition

Not long ago, even a simple animation had to borrow the power of JavaScript.

However, it is possible to implement a good animation without JavaScript.

This means that complex JavaScript code can be replaced with a single line of CSS that is simple and legible.

The following code shows how many people use the jQuery library to fade elements for 0.5 seconds.
An example of an opacity halving from the circle state when hover is over and returning to its original state when hover is released.

```js
$('a').hover(
function () {
$(this).stop().animate({opacity : '.5'}, 500); },
function () { $(this).stop().animate({opacity : '1'}, 500);
});
```

The example above is not complicated, but it seems to be a little long compared to having a very simple effect.
It should also be taken into account that at least the phrase that jQeury should be included in the code, which means that the user does not need a JavaScript-enabled browser.

If you change the JavaScript syntax above to a way that uses CSS transition:

```css
a {
transition: .5s;
}
a:hover {
opacity: .5;
}
```

The above method not only takes much less time and effort than using jQuery, but the code is simplified, making it more readable.

Simple code for simple effects! That`s the standard.

Of course, this example uses minimal grammar to emphasize that it is simple and clear compared to jQuery.

From now on, we will learn about properties that can have the same effect as above.

transition - screen movement, transition

A quick look at the properties of the transition is as follows:

The properties that handle screen movements include four attributes that control the animation processing, the animation duration, the type of animation, and the time the animation starts.

```css
a {
background: yellow;
color: #000;

/* Define the property value where the transition will occur */
transition-property: background-color;

/* Specify the time the transition occurs */
transition-duration: 1s; /* equal to 1000 milliseconds */

transition-timing-function: linear; /* 등속도 */

transition-delay: 0.5s; /* 500 milliseconds */
}

a:hover {
background-color: blue;
color: #fff;
}
```

CSS Transition: IE 10+

- transition-property: Specifying this value as an attribute that is affected by the screen movement will have a screen movement effect only for certain points (which attribute to be transmitted).
- transition-duration: how long it takes for the CSS effect to be reflected, i.e. how long it takes for the screen to end (the duration of the transition)
- transition-timing-function: Timing function (with which movement (acceleration or deceleration over time)
- transition-delay: Transition latency (when delaying animation)
- transition: transition shorthand (when you put the above attributes together)

### transition-property, transition-duration

The property `transition-property` is a property that determines which property to represent in the element as a transition effect.

In addition, `transition-duration` is a property that specifies how long it takes for a screen transition to end, and you can attach ms (milliseconds, 1/1000) or s (seconds) to the value applied to time.

For example, 1,000 ms equals 1s and 1.25s 1250 ms.

Because the default value for the transition period is 0, you must give a duration value to implement the screen movement effect.

The following is a simple example code for `transition-property`, `transition-duration`.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="281" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/OXdaJQ?height=281&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=OXdaJQ&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=transition-property%2C%20duration%20%EC%98%88%EC%A0%9C&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="transition-property, duration 예제" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_OXdaJQ"></iframe>

The first demo-01 specified `font-size` as property. As mentioned above, there must be a duration value to implement the screen movement effect. If only `transition-property` is specified without a duration value, it will not be different from the `:hover` font size that can be implemented simply at CSS 2.1 level.

And if you look at demo-02, only `transition-duration: 2s;` is declared.

Because the transition-property is declared all by default, all properties have that screen-moving (switching) effect.

Note that if only transition-duration is set, the transition effect is present, but vice versa, no transition effect will be created.

### transition-timing-function (acceleration processing using a time function)

From now on, a little complicated situation will develop.

Incremental acceleration or deceleration for CSS effects can be more effective, which is the `transition-timing-function`.

This is an attribute that indicates how the screen is accelerated and decelerated during the time that the screen transition takes place.

The representative keywords of the time function that you can use to control the effectiveness of the screen transition are as follows:

- linear : constant flow from beginning to end without changing speed during constant speed and transition.
- ease : gradual acceleration, default is ease, which starts slowly, accelerates quickly, and ends slowly again.
- ease-in : acceleration, animation starts slowly and ends in a fast flow.
- ease-out: Slowdown, animation starts quickly and ends slowly.
- ease-in-out : decelerates after gradual acceleration, starts slowly, then speeds up at the midpoint, then slows down again, which is similar to `ease`.
The degree of change is not as rapid as in the case of `ease`.

You can set the screen movement effect at what speed during the screen movement period and adjust the animation speed.

Let`s make the following screen and see what actually works.

We`ve processed it using a little JavaScript, so please click anywhere in the following screen area.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="753" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/akXXgb?height=753&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=akXXgb&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=transition-timing-function%20%232&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="transition-timing-function #2" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_akXXgb"></iframe>

Cubic-bezier (3rd Bezier Curve)

In addition to the above keywords, there is also a `cubic-bezier` function that can be applied to `transition-timing-function` for more sophisticated control.

The grammar of the third cubic Bezier curve is as follows:

```css
.selector {
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2);
}
```

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/254B454A57B1EAB617)

The tertiary Vezier curve is made of four points that exist on the grid, with coordinates from 0 to 1 along both axes.

The four points are called p0, p1, p2, and p3, which are represented by two pairs of (x, y) coordinates.
Depending on the location, you can indicate the degree of curvature (curve) of the curve.

At this point, the first point (p0) defines in the function two other points, (1,0) the last point (p3) is (1, 1) and p1 is (x1, y1) and p2 (x1, y1).

p0, p3 always means the same value, so you don`t need to specify it separately.

The cubic-bezier function is difficult to use when you are not familiar with mathematical calculations.

However, with online tools that generate coordinate values on the tertiary Bezier curve, you can easily identify and test different coordinate points.

And it`s easy to recognize in Chrome developer tools, so I think it`s enough to test acceleration and use the coordinates instead of thinking about it too much.

### transition-delay (delay property)

The last property of the screen shift (transition, transition) effect is the `transition-delay` property that allows you to set when the transition occurs.

As in the `transition-duration` property, the time value of this property can also be set in ms or s.

The default value is 0, which results in a transition effect as soon as an event occurs, and entering a positive number in the time value results in a transition effect after that time has elapsed.

The following code is an example of a transition effect occurring two seconds later.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="218" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/JKxzNR?height=218&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=JKxzNR&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=transition-timing-delay%20%231&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="transition-timing-delay #1" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_JKxzNR"></iframe>

Use negative for transition-delay

You can use negative numbers for `transition-delay`, and specifying a negative value can create a quite interesting effect.

If you apply a negative number to the delay property, the transition effect occurs immediately (immediately), but the animation is skipped for a set time (duration).

To determine the result, try setting a delay of -2 seconds for the transition effect that will last for 4 seconds as follows:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="266" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/YWBgxA?height=266&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=YWBgxA&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=transition-delay%20%232&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="transition-delay #2" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_YWBgxA"></iframe>

### transition

Until now, the screen movement effect has been implemented by adding various attributes.

Just as you can abbreviate the `background` attribute among CSS properties and abbreviate multiple properties into a single line of code, you can also write `transition` as follows:

As mentioned before, transition-duration is a required value. If the initial value of `transition-duration` is 0 seconds, the transition is too immediate to be seen.

```css
.selector {
/* Recommended Property Order */
/* transition: prop dur timfn delay; */
div {
transition: opacity .5s linear 2s;
transition: linear .5s opacity 2s;
transition: linear opacity .5s 2s;
transition: .5s 2s opacity linear;
}
```

As shown above, you can create those values in order, and the first `transition-property` is a record of the attributes that are affected, which you use to try to influence only certain attributes.

Usually, all values are used a lot and are applied to all properties, so you can use them as default values.

The rest can be written in the order of duration → timing properties → latency as follows:

The point to note is that if the time values are transition-duration and transition-delay, and only one time value is declared, this is considered transition-duration value, and transition-delay is considered to use the default or inherited value.

In other words, the order of the two time-related attributes `transition-duration` and `transition-delay` must be followed, and the duration must always be specified first.

If you keep the order, you can set (define) the order of the remaining keywords.

### Understanding the screen transition (transfer) attribute

As we discussed earlier, we mentioned that it is common to define the transition property in the initial state style.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

```css
a {
background: blue;
}
a:hover {
background: red;
transition: background .5s ease-in-out;
}
```

```css
a {
background: blue;
transition: background .5s ease-in-out;
}
a:hover {
background: red;
}
```

False examples are not necessarily wrong. However, most of the cases are unintentional effects.

That is, if you want a screen transition to occur when the element is in the :over state, the `transition` property must be defined in the target, not in the `:over` rule.

If written as above, the transition occurs when the element changes to the `:hover` state, but when `:hover` is released, the element does not change incrementally and returns very quickly to its original basic style.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/bOrJxK?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=bOrJxK&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=%EC%9D%98%EB%8F%84%EC%B9%98%20%EC%95%8A%EC%9D%80%20%ED%8A%B8%EB%9E%9C%EC%A7%80%EC%85%98%20%ED%9A%A8%EA%B3%BC&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="의도치 않은 트랜지션 효과" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_bOrJxK"></iframe>

Sometimes this effect may be intentionally desired, but typically in the `:hover` state, the transition will slowly take place and then go back.

With this in mind, there will be no misuse of metastasis and more accurate application where necessary.

On

The previous example was an unintended effect, but if the user intentionally wants a different transition effect when the mouse pointer approaches the element and moves away from the element.

In this very case, the unintended method of courtesy is not misused, but rather may be used effectively.

Check the following effects:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="457" width="100%" name="cp_embed_6" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/GomLxe?height=457&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=GomLxe&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=transition%20on%20%26%20off%20test&amp;name=cp_embed_6" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="transition on &amp; off test" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_GomLxe"></iframe>

The code above is that the part about the initial transition used when the element is `:hover` has been moved to the side of the `:hover` rule, where other `transition` attributes are taken up to be animated when the element changes to its original state.

The result is that when the element is in the `:hover` state, the background color changes from blue to red over a second, and when the `:hover` is released, the red background changes gradually over a longer period of 5 seconds.

You can also create a situation that is a little more complicated than above. Examine the following codes and effects:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="426" width="100%" name="cp_embed_7" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/EPmJRb?height=426&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=EPmJRb&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=transition%20on%20%26%20off%20test%20%232&amp;name=cp_embed_7" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="transition on &amp; off test #2" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_EPmJRb"></iframe>

The example above is not much different from the previous code, but it has a fundamentally different effect.

The `:over` state transition only applies the `background` attribute to the `transition-property`.

In other words, the value of 360deg does not affect the action of the first `:over` because the background color is transferred from blue to red for one second and no animation is applied to the `rotate()` function.(Of course, the 360deg value is the same as the initial 0deg value)

Conversely, the `transition` property in the default rule, i.e. the property that gives the change from the `:over` state to the original state, has only the duration parameter.

A brief analysis of the final output is as follows:

- When the user moves the mouse over the element, the background color changes from blue to red for one second.
- When the mouse pointer deviates from the element, the background color changes from red to blue, and the element rotates 360 degrees in a counterclockwise direction in 0.5 seconds.
