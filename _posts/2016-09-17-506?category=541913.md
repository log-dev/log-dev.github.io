CSS Dimension

`dimension` refers to the dimensions of the height and width of space.

In CSS, you can define width and height with the following properties:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

```css
.selector {
width: value;
max-width: value;
min-width: value;
height: value;
max-height: value;
min-height: value;
}
```

- `auto` : default, browser width, set automatically according to height
- `length` : specify the length directly in units such as px, em, rem, ex, etc.
- `%` : calculated and specified by the percentage value of the area containing the element

### padding

`Padding` is the property of specifying the outer margin of an element by `margin`.

Padding is a shortening property of four attributes, `padding-bottom`, `padding-left`, `padding-right`, and `padding-top`.

Here, you can optionally use all four values of all four.

```css
padding: 10px 5px 15px 20px; (top right bottom left)
padding: 10px 5px 15px; (top right-left bottom)
padding: 10px 5px; (top-bottom right-left)
padding: 10px; (top-right-bottom-left)
```

margin

| --- | --- |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

`margin` is an abbreviated property of four attributes: `margin-bottom`, `margin-left`, `margin-right`, and `margin-top`.

Here, you can optionally use all four values of all four.

```css
margin: 10px 5px 15px 20px; (top right bottom left)
margin: 10px 5px 15px; (top right-left bottom)
margin: 10px 5px; (top-bottom right-left)
margin: 10px; (top-right-bottom-left)
```

### border

border

The property used to apply a line (boundary) to the `border` element.

A border property is an abbreviated property that gives a border effect to an element and allows all border properties to be declared at once.

The properties of border-color, border-width, and border-style can be declared all at once, and only style-color or style-width, such as {border:solid #ff0000;}, is acceptable.

Instead, any style property given must be declared.

- `Border-width` : Specifies the width (bold) of the border
- `Border-style` : Specifies the style of the border
- `Border-color` : Specifies the color of the border

- `dotted` : Specify dot border
- `dashed` : Specify dash symbol (-) border
- `solid` : Specify typical line borders
- `double` : border in two lines

```css
.selector {
border: width style color;
}
```

outline

`outline` is a line surrounding the outside of an element, and if `border` is applied to an element, `outline` is created outside of that.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

`outline` can be at least `style-color` or `style-width` as `{outline:solid #FF0000}. Instead, whatever value is given, `style` property must be declared.

`outline` is not included in the area of the element, so the width and height properties of the element do not include the thickness of the outline.

- `dotted` : Specify dot border
- `dashed` : Specify dash symbol (-) border
- `solid` : Specify typical line borders
- `double` : border in two lines

### Box Model

`Box model` is a concept that is organized by assuming a tag as a box.

For example, if you are confident in the room and assume that you are content, the room can express the rest of the space in padding (inner margin), the wall in the room (boarder), and the outer space in margin (outward margin).

And when the floorboards in the room are laid down, the floorboards can be understood as a space to express the background image.

When padding is set in the box model, the background image displays the background image, including the area up to the padding.

It is called the box model that describes all these elements as the concept of the box.

So each box has four boundaries: margin boundary, border boundary, padding boundary, content boundary.

When you create the `width`, `height` properties, the content area is represented by width,height.

And most importantly, the margin is not included in the actual size of the box.

```undefined
'<div class="box-01"box model 1</div>
<div class="box-02"box model 2</div>
£div class="box-03"box model 3=
£div class="box-04"box model 4='
```

Box Model Width/Height Calculation Method

Defining the exact width and height values for an element is very important when aligning the layout.

If you miscalculate the width and height of the element when the yaw is applied with inner margins and lines, the layout may not be aligned as intended.

display vs visibility

### display

The primary role of the `display` property is to show or hide content on the screen.

This property also changes the properties of the element.

The `display` property specifies the type of element that is related to whether it is inline or block type.

```css
.selector { display:value; }
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |
| | |

`display: none;` is used to hide content.

For example, for content initially hidden and seen when you click a button, you process none/block with a script.

### visibility

The `visibility` property specifies whether the element is visible or invisible.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| | |
| | |
| | |

```undefined
<p>visibility: <span>hidden</span> and display: <strong>none</strong></p>
```

### overflow

The `overflow` property specifies how an element`s box is represented, such as whether to scroll through it when it overflows its content or not to show it overflows.

That is, you can decide how to express it when it is out of a particular area of that element.

```css
.box {
overflow:value;
}
```
