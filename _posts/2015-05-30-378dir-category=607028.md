### XAMPP PHP Configuration

Learn about the simple PHP configuration.

```undefined
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Module Settings ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

[Date]
; Defines the default timezone used by the date functions
; http://php.net/date.timezone
date.timezone = "Asia/Seoul"

```

```undefined
; File upload permission
file_uploads = On

; Number of file uploads
max_file_uploads = 200

; Maximum upload file size
upload_max_filesize = 2000M

; Maximum data size to be handed over in a Post manner
post_max_size = 2048M

; Maximum running time of script, 0 is infinite
max_execution_time = 60

; How long does the php engine upload data before moving to the script page?
max_input_time = 3600

; Memory settings
memory_limit = 128M

```

By default, IMAP is disabled in XAMPP. To enable this, remove the semicolon from the php extension of xampp\php\php.ini.

```undefined
extension=php_imap.dll

```

It is activated by deleting a semicolon from xampp\php\php.ini, like any other Zend extensions.

```undefined
zend_extension = "C:\xampp\php\ext\php_eaccelerator_ts.dll"

```

After changing php.ini, restarting Apache is required.

If changing the php.ini setting does not apply, connect to http://localhost/xampp/phpinfo.php to verify the location of the Loaded Configuration File.

### XAMPP MySQL Settings

The setup file path is \xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini.

```undefined
[client]
default-character-set = utf8

[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake=FALSE
init_connect="SET collation_connection = utf8_general_ci"
init_connect="SET NAMES utf8"
character-set-server = utf8
collation-server = utf8_general_ci

[mysqldump]
default-character-set = utf8

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8

```

```undefined
[mysqld]
max_allowed_packet = 256M

```

Since msysgit was installed and in use, it was conveniently accessed using it.

- Go to the drive where XAMPP is installed
- Go to \xampp\mysql\bin
- Right-click > Run Git Bash
- Access to mysql -u root -p
