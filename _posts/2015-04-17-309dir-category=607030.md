Describe the `link` element that is included in the head element. The rel property of the link element also exists in element a, and although it does not belong to the head area, we will deal with it together.

### LINK Element

The `link` element displays links to other documents or external sources. This link refers to linking external sources and handling them more effectively, rather than hyperlinks to other document references. It is often used to manage style sheet documents separately.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css">

```

The rel property specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document. 속성값은 alternate, author, help, icon, license, next, pingback, prefetch, search, stylesheet를 가질 수 있다. rel is additional information for the href property and should be defined only when the href property exists.

The rel properties are used for A, AREA, LINK elements, and some properties vary in their application depending on the elements.

A property value for referring to an icon file address that can represent the current document and is only available on the link element. This icon is called a Pavicon and helps users quickly identify specific sites or documents.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.png">

```

Property value for referring to the address of the pingback server, which can only be used in the link element. When a person links document A to document B, automatically informing the author of document A is called ping-back. In other words, the author of document A can create a pingback server to know which documents he links to, and request that the link element`s pingback property value be used to automatically receive notification of whether it links or not.

```html
<link rel="pingback" href="pingback server">

```

A property value that first withdraws (prefetch) a particular document, image, etc., and specifies that this information is remembered by the browser, and can be used in link, a, area elements. If the user is likely to revisit the current document in the near future, the author needs to give a hint to the browser to remember the current document. This hint is represented by the prefetch property value, which causes the specified document URL to be stored in the browser cache. Such stored documents can load faster than those that do not.

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="http://www.example.com/search_results.html/">

```

A property value that specifies the search interface for the current document and is available in link, a, and area elements. Current search engines are contents that are made in the form of flash or video that are not found or difficult to find by search engines. At the current level, there is a movement to define search interfaces in standard format in XML document format in order for search engines and content to communicate with each other.

```html
<link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" href="http://example.com/search.xml/" title="content search results">

```

Designating the rel attribute of the link element as search and the XML document written with the search interface as the href attribute allows the search engine to index the current document.

A property value that specifies an external style sheet and can only be used in link elements. If a style sheet is placed externally rather than directly in an HTML document, the link element allows the external style sheet to be recalled. When using an external style sheet, the style sheet requested once by the browser cache feature can be recycled without additional HTTP requests, which can improve document loading speed.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/normalize.css">

```

Keep in mind that the things described below are also available in the link element.

A property for specifying document links to replace the current document. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. It allows us to know that the current document and its contents are the same, but in different formats, such as print documents and translation documents.

```html
<a rel="alternate" href="http://www.example.com/web_standards_print.html/">인쇄</a>

```

This is a property to specify a document link to the author of the current document. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. The author attribute value is used to provide specific information on the operation and management of documents, such as authors and contacts, in separate documents.

```html
<a rel="author" href="http://www.example.com/profile.html/">저자 소개</a>

```

A property for specifying a document link with a unique address (permalink). a, can be used in the area element. Important documents must not be addressed so that users registered as bookmarks can return them later. If the current document address is likely to change, the user should be moved to a unique address and then registered as a favorite there, which uses the bookmark attribute value.

```html
'<a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.example.com/web_standards.html/Go to the source of this document</a>

```

A property for specifying a document link in an external location. a, can be used in the area element. This property value tells you that the linked document is part of another Web site.

```html
<a rel="external" href="http://www.w3c.org/html5.html/">HTML5</a>

```

Property for specifying document links with help. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. Sometimes we link help to guide us through terminology or how to use it. For example, when a user encounters a link called a public certificate, it is hard for screen reader users to notice this link, even if they can see that it is contextually associated with help. This is because it is not known whether this link is associated with help or with a certificate download document. In this case, it is desirable to use the rel property to provide hints on whether it is helpful or not.

```html
<a rel="help" href="http://www.example.com/public_certi.html/">공인인증서</a>

```

This is a property for specifying a document link that contains copyright information (copyright) of the current document. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. Copyright information is provided in the Putter area to indicate rights to the entire document, and copyright information is needed separately when presenting sources of external content within the document.

```html
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses.html/">CCL</a>

```

A property that specifies a document link so that the search engine does not follow the linked document. a, can be used in the area element. To prevent the search engine from following all links within the document, specify noofollow in the meta element of the header.

```html
<meta name="robots" content="nofollow">

```

To specify individually for each particular link, specify in the a or area element.

```html
<a rel="nofollow" href="login.html/">로그인</a>

```

Search engines, such as Google, want to index (index) documents by following their own rules because they do not need to index less reliable content, free links, low-priority documents (e.g., login documents) to reduce unnecessary indexing.

The property of specifying document links so that referrers do not occur even if links are selected. a, can be used in the area element. When a user visits document B through a link in document A, the browser sends the URL information of document A to the web server where document B is located. The URL information of document A is called referrer or HTTP referrer.

```html
<a rel="noreferrer" href="http://www.reference.com/" target="_blank">참고문서</a>

```

If you specify a value for the coreferrer attribute, the browser sends a referrer even if the user selects a or area element.

A property that specifies linked documents for sidebar purposes. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. Sidebar means an area located on the side of the body of a document. Documents consisting of simple information can consist of only the body area, but if the information becomes complicated, side bars are needed, such as navigation areas and related content areas, as well as the body area.

```html
<a rel="sidebar" href="toc.html" title="Help">Create panel with table of contents for Opera help</a>

```

The author may indicate that the linked document is available as a sidebar through rel="sidebar".

The property that tags the current document. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. Tags can be viewed as keywords or topic words for searching. The search engine recognizes linked text as keywords that describe the current document at its core, not just linked text, and indexing with these texts can significantly increase task efficiency.

```html
<a rel="tag" href="http://www.example.com/allaboutdesign.html/">디자인</a>

```

When rel="tag" is specified in the linked text, the text is tagged for the current document.

Specifies the previous document. It refers to documents that are available in link, a, and area elements and that are prior to the current document in a continuous information structure. It is not yet clear what effect it will have when attribute values are specified, but if each document has information about the past or the following, it is believed that a browser or search engine can help you grasp the sequence or structure of the document as a whole.

```html
<a rel="prev" href="page1.html">첫번째 문서</a>

```

Specify the following documents: Available in link, a, and area elements, refers to documents in successive information structures that are later than current documents.

```html
<a rel="next" href="page3.html">세번째 문서</a>

```
