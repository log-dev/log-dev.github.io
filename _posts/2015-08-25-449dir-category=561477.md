Web`s most popular front-end template... That`s what it says on the introduction page. If you look for HTML5 related materials, it`s a template that you often encounter, and it`s a collection of recommended sources, so it`s a template that I recommend for those who start it first, as well as those who need a systematic configuration.

### Boiler Plate Introduction

Consider using the HTML5 boilerplate if you are just starting a project with HTML5 or if you are looking for various support from CSS. It is a template that makes cross-browsing easier for HTML5 use, including essential styles and tools such as polyfill and modernizer. It also includes a tool that automatically combines CSS and JS files and removes annotations to create code for product launch.

This project is a combination of years of iterative product development and community knowledge. It does not confer a particular development philosophy or framework and is free to build structures in any way it pleases.

- It helps to use new elements with confidence in using HTML5.
- It is designed with incremental enhancements in mind.
- Include:
Normalize.css is used to normalize CSS and improve common bugs.
Use jQuery CDN with local fallback.
It uses the custom build of Modernizr for functional inspection.
It uses Apache server settings to improve the performance and security of websites.

- It uses Apache server settings to improve the performance and security of websites.
- Placeholder CSS Media Queries.
- Use a useful CSS helper class.
- We provide a basic printing style with optimized performance.
- It provides an optimized version of Google Universal Analytics code.
- Protection devices for `console` doors that cause JavaScript errors are provided in older browsers.
- It is configured to easily delete unnecessary parts.
- It provides a wide range of inline and attached documents.

- Chrome (latest 2)
- Firefox (latest 2)
- Internet Explorer 8+
- Opera (latest 2)
- Safari (latest 2)

The browsers mentioned above maintain compatibility, but do not imply that they cannot be used for other older browsers. If you need support for older browsers (IE 6+, Firefox 3.6+, Safari 4+), you can use HTML5 Boilerplate v4, but development is no longer in progress.

### How to Use the Boiler Plate

Download the HTML5 boiler plate from the homepage and include it in the site or application:

- Sets the basic structure of the site.
- It adds some content, styles, and features.
- Run the site locally to see what it looks like.
- Optionally run build scripts to automate site optimization
- Site Deployment

> There is no particular usage and it is not important. The code it contains is important, and the structure, style, and functionality that fits the site or application you're building are important.

### Boiler Plate Basic Structure

The basic HTML5 boilerplate site structure is as follows, and when you manufacture a website or application, refer to this structure and write it.

```undefined
.
£-- css (this directory contains CSS files for all projects)
£ £-- main.css (Create a default CSS file here to be inserted into almost every page)
£ £-- normalize.css (file for CSS reset)
£-- doc (this directory contains all HTML5 boilerplate documentation)
£-- img (Images needed for site production are stored here)
£-- js (this directory contains JS files for all projects)
£ £-- main.js (for reference to or including JavaScript code for sites and applications)
│ ├-- plugins.js (use to include all other plug-ins, such as jQuery plug-ins and third-party scripts, including fallback to prevent console errors)
£ £-- vendor (this directory is intended to contain all third-party library code)
£ £-- jquery.min.js (by default, includes the latest jQuery library as a compressed version)
£ £-- modernizr.min.js (by default, includes the latest Modernizr library as a compressed version)
£-- .editorconfig (help to maintain a consistent coding style between other editors and IDE)
£-- .htaccess (including default settings for Apache server settings)
£-- 404.html (provide custom 404 pages)
£-- apple-touch-icon.png (icon to be used as an Apple touch icon)
£-- browserconfig.xml (including settings for custom tiles for IE11)
£-- index.html (default HTML skeleton that forms the basis for all pages)
£-- humans.txt (information technology such as contacts for technical advice from the site and application makers)
£--robots.txt (set the zone you do not want the search engine crawler to access)
£-- crossdomain.xml (template for cross-domain request operation)
£-- favicon.ico (Favicon)
£-- tile-wide.png (IE tile icon)
£-- tile.png (IE tile icon)
```
