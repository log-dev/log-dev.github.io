### Interactive controls

Interactive control is a tool for transferring user input data to a browser or server. In the past, form or JavaScript had to be used to transfer data. As the web became increasingly applicable, data transmission needed to take place anywhere in the web document, and new details, summary, command, and menu elements were proposed.

### DETAILS Element

The details element is a newly added element in HTML5 that displays the details (DETAILS). This element lets you selectively show details. It is a technique that configures hidden details to appear when a user selects a summary, which is called a "diclosure widget" in W3C.

```html
<details>
<summary>Copyright 1999-2011.</summary>
<p> - by Refsnes Data. All Rights Reserved.</p>
<p>All content and graphics on this web site are the property of the company Refsnes Data.</p>
</details>

```

- It is used with the summary element.
- It can be implemented directly from a browser without any additional JavaScript.

The open property specifies the details as shown. By default, the dtails element displays the details hidden. This is intended to show details only when there is a user choice, so if you want to show details without user selection, you should use the open attribute.

```html
<details open="open">
<summary>Copyright 1999-2011.</summary>
<p> - by Refsnes Data. All Rights Reserved.</p>
<p>All content and graphics on this web site are the property of the company Refsnes Data.</p>
</details>

```

### SUMMARY ELEMENTS

The summary element displays a summary. A summary here means a summary or title of the details provided by the details element.

- In order to convey the relationship "summary-details" properly, the summary element must be followed immediately after the details element.
- See details element above

### MENU Element

The menu element displays the menu (MENU). It is mainly used in menu bars, toolbars, context menus, etc.

```html
<menu type="toolbar">
<li>
<menu label="File">
<button type="button" onclick="file_new()">New...</button>
<button type="button" onclick="file_open()">Open...</button>
<button type="button" onclick="file_save()">Save</button>
</menu>
</li>
<li>
<menu label="Edit">
<button type="button" onclick="edit_cut()">Cut</button>
<button type="button" onclick="edit_copy()">Copy</button>
<button type="button" onclick="edit_paste()">Paste</button>
</menu>
</li>
</menu>

```

The type attribute specifies the menu type. This property determines the representation form of the menu element, but there is no browser supporting the menu element yet, so it is not known exactly how it is represented.

- `type="list" : A list menu is created when a property value is specified as a list. A list of list menus is not a list of common items but a list of instructions. This is the default value.
- `type="context" : If a property value is specified as context, a context menu is created. Like a menu that appears when the right mouse button is pressed, a context menu refers to a menu consisting of only a list of instructions to support a particular situation.
- `type="toolbar" : If a property value is specified as toolbar, a toolbar menu is created. Toolbars are a separate collection of frequently used commands.

The label attribute specifies a menu name. This property applies to menus that contain submenus.

### COMMAND Element

The command element displays a command button (COMMAND button). Command buttons are buttons that invoke commands such as copying, deleting, and printing. This element allows a control element to be provided even where it is not defined as a form element.

```html
<menu>
<command type="command" label="Save" onclick="save()">Save</command>
</menu>

```

- This element can only be used within the menu element.

We don`t have a browser yet.

The type property specifies the command type. This property determines the representation form of the command element.

- `type="command" : If the attribute value is specified as command, a command button is created.(default)
- `type="checkbox" : A checkbox is created when a property value is specified as checkbox.
- `type="radio" : A radio button is created when the attribute value is specified as radio.

The icon property specifies an icon to represent the command. The attribute value is the address where the image file is located.

```html
<menu>
<command type="radio" label="Left" icon="left.png" onclick="setAlign('left')">Left</command>
</menu>

```

The radiogroup property specifies the group name of the command element to which the radio button is applied. This property can only be specified for command elements that are type="radio" and allows command elements with the same attribute value to be connected and operated.

```html
<menu>
<command type="radio" label="Left" radiogroup="alignment" onclick="setAlign('left')">Left</command>
</menu>

```
