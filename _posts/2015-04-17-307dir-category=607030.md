Learn more about the `head` area of the Web document and what elements you can include inside. It consists of 3 sheets, so please refer to it.

### HEAD Element

The HTML `head` element represents a collection of document metadata. This includes defining scripts and stylesheets or linking them.

```html
<head>
...
</head>

```

Most browsers automatically configure the head element even if the head tag is omitted from the markup. Some browsers do not support this (Android = 1.6, iPhone = 3.1.3, Nokia 90, Opera = 9.27, Safari = 3.2.1).

Elements that can be used include `title`, `base`, `link`, `style`, `meta`, `script`, `noscript`, and `command`.

### TITLE ELEMENTS

The element `<title>` is the element for displaying the title of the document. Duplicate designations are not allowed, and if there is no title element, the browser will show the file name of the HTML document or treat it as "no title". The title of the document is closely related to search engine optimization (SEO).

- The title of the document should be representative of the content.
- It should be as short and concise as possible.
- It shall be available for identification purposes of the documentation.

```html
<head>
<title>Document Title</title>
</head>

```

The search engine compares the search results with the search words based on the title of the document, the contents of the Meta tag, and the first 100-150 characters of the text.

### BASE Element

The `<base>` element displays the document`s reference URL. Several links can be provided within the document, if these links refer to the same location, the reference URL can be specified through the base element to represent links in the body area as relative links.

- If you write it with a relative link, you don`t have to write it with the entire path every time, so the code is concise and the file size of the document is reduced.
- This is also useful when links refer to documents on other servers.
- It can only be used once in one document.

```html
<head>
<title>Document Title</title>
<base href="http://www.example.com/info/">
</head>

```

The base element can specify basic href and target properties, which in principle affect the entire document, so that the browser processes the title element and then immediately places the base element at the front of the document head.

### META Element

The meta element replaces the HEAD (Document Head) area #2 - META element.

### LINK Element

The link element replaces the HEAD (Document Head) area #3 - LINK element.

### STYLE ELEMENTS

The "style" element displays style information. Style information contains information about how content is represented, and documents containing this information are called stylesheets. Since this style sheet contains representation information about the document as a whole, it must be provided in the document head and can be used multiple times within a document as needed.

```html
<head>
<style>
body {font-family: 'Malgun Gothic'}
h1 {font-family: '필기체'; font-weight: bolder; color: #4183C4;}
</style>
</head>

```

Although the type properties of style and script elements are omitted, browsers treat them as stylesheets and JavaScript.

The newly added scoped property in HTML5 specifies a limited style. By default, stylesheets are applied throughout the document, but this property allows style applications to be limited to certain elements. If the element is a parent element, the same style is applied to the child element, and if this property is not specified, the specified style is applied to the entire document.

```html
<article>
<h1>Style Scoped</h1>
<p>The scoped attribute for the style element will eventually....</p>
<section>
<style scoped>
p { color: red; }
</style>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus...</p>
</section>
</article>

```
