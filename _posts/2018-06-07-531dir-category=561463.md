Take a closer look at the strings used in PHP and look at the rules involved.

### String

It is used to express characters, and there is no limit to memory space. In other words, it supports unlimited strings regardless of the length of the string.

Strings can be assigned using double quotes ("), single quotes (""), Heredoc, and Nowdoc.

When a string is written between double quotes, such as `Hello $name \n`, PHP goes through the process of interpreting the string. A variable inside a double quotation mark outputs the value of the variable and, if there is a special character, does what is given to the special character.

Special characters that can be used inside double quotes are shown below.

| Special Characters | Meaning |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| \n | Open Character (line break) |
| \r | carriage return (move the cursor indicating the current position to the front) |
| \t | Horizontal Tab |
| \" | Quote |
| \$ | Dollar Mark |

```php
<?php
$str = 'World';
echo "Hello $str"; //Hello World
echo "Hello \n" //Hello
?>

```

Special characters and variables are not allowed in single quotes. Only single quotes and backslashes (\) to output the backslashes themselves are interpreted. Single quotes have an advantage in performance over double quotes because they do not go through string interpretation procedures, but there is no significant difference.

```php
<?php
$str = 'World';
echo 'Hello $str'; //Hello $str
echo 'Hello \n' //Hello \n
?>

```

Heredoc grammar is a more convenient way of expressing a string using a method that tells the beginning and end of a string. When a string is started, an identifier for the string is displayed after `<<` and when the string is terminated, an identifier is displayed again.

```php
<?php
$str = <<<EOD
Inserts a string.
Repeat the string.
EOD;
?>

```

We used the identifier EOD to represent the string, and the result is the same as using double quotes. If there is an advantage over double quotes, there is no need to use reverse slash to add quotes inside the string.

From PHP 5.3.0, the Nowdoc syntax was added, with single quotes attached to the identifier and no interpretation of the variable. It is similar to the single quote method.

```php
<?php
$str = <<<'EOT'
Hello $name.
String is not interpreted.
'EOT';
?>

```

### Interpretation of PHP variables

In double quotes and Heredoc grammar, variables inside the string are interpreted and processed, which can have unexpected consequences depending on the string that follows. To safely handle this, the variable `{}It is recommended to use ` to cover up.

```php
<?php
$money = '1000';
echo "Imports are $money generated."; //Import 1000 occurred.
echo "Imports incurred $money won."; //$moneyOne is not valid to find.
echo "Import is $money won."; //I have incurred 1,000 won in revenue.
echo "Imports incurred {$money} KRW."; //I have incurred 1,000 won in revenue.
?>

```

### PHP String Summation

In PHP, periods (.) can be used to form multiple strings into a single string. Using a string combinator within the `echo` command allows PHP to combine several strings into one and print them into a browser.

```php
<?php
$name = 'Hong Gil-dong';

Echo 'My name is '.$name.';
?>

```
