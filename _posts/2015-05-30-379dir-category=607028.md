### Installing the Bitnami Wordpress installer

Bitnami is a single-click library that helps you build popular server applications and development environments. XAMPP is also supported by Bitnami.

- Download and install the Bitnami Wordpress version.
- First, I ask about the language of installation, and I choose it because I support Korean.
- During installation, you will be asked to the folder where XAMPP was installed, which specifies your installation location (default C:\xampp).
- Enter the login account name, name, email address, and MySQL password for XAMPP (Appache and MySQL must be running on XAMPP).
- Enter the blog name.
- Determine whether to use the smtp email service.
- 설치가 완료되고 모듈구동을 실행한다는 메세지를 확인하면 생성한 워드프레스 사이트로 접속된다.

The connection address is http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/.
The installed wordpress is installed in `xampp/apps/wordpress`.
The setup files are located in `xampp/apps/wordpress/conf`.

### Manual Wordpress Installation

- phpmyadmin Connect and create WordPress DB
- Download the latest version from http://wordpress.org
- Unzip and upload to desired directory (upload to folder collection)
- Access the directory where wordpress is installed from the browser to the URL (for example, http://test.example.com/wordpress)
