Learn about WSL`s default user password reset, how to replace password loss, and WSL`s default Windows-to-Linux privileges.

### The account that you set up when you install WSL.

When WSL is installed, it is required to enter a user account, which is automatically given several special attributes.

- When WSL is enabled, it consists of default users who automatically log in.
- It is included in the Linux administrator sudo group by default.

As you can select a distribution when installing WSL, each distribution must have its own Linux user account and password, and configure the Linux user account whenever you add, reinstall, or reset the distribution.

Linux user accounts are distribution-independent and separate from Windows user accounts.

### resetting the Linux user account password

If you know the password for a Linux account, you can change it by entering the `passwd` command.

```bash
passwd
```

If a password is lost, the root user is registered as the default user, although it varies from distribution to distribution.

Suppose the default user account is a tester.

- On Windows, open a Command Prompt (CMD) window.
- Set the default user to root.
`c:\> ubuntu config --default-user root`
- When you run WSL, you log in as root.
- Reset the password for the user account.
BASH
`$ passwd tester`
- Return to Windows, open the CMD window and reset the default user.
`C:\> ubuntu config --default-user tester(사용자명)`

If you use another distribution, open a CMD window and say, `Deployment Identification.You can figure out how to set up a default user with commands such as exe /?`.

### WSL 권한(permission)

Two important concepts that should be noted in the use of WSL are as follows:

- The Windows privilege model controls the process for Windows resources.
- The Linux permission model controls the process for Linux resources.

When running Linux on WSL, Linux has the same Windows privileges as the process of running it.

Linux can start with one of two privilege levels:

- Normal (non-elevated): Linux runs with the privileges of the logged in user.
- Elevated/admin : Linux runs with the Elevated/admin Windows privileges.

> Do not start high processes, whether Windows or Linux applications/tools/shells, because they can change/damage system-wide settings and data and access/modify protected files and folders!

The Windows privileges above are separate from those within the Linux instance. This affects only the user`s permissions within the Linux environment and the file system, and has no effect on Windows permissions. Therefore, running a Linux process as root (via ex. sudo) gives only the corresponding Process Manager privileges in the Linux environment.

For example, in a Bash session without administrator privileges, accessing the Administrator folder with `cd/mnt/c/Users/Administrator` encounters a "Permission Denied" error, but is accessible in a Bash session with Windows Administrator privileges.

Linux does not grant access to the Administrator directory by entering `sudocd/mnt/c/Users/Administrator` because permissions within Windows are managed by Windows.

The Linux permission model is important in Linux environments where users currently have permissions based on Linux users. For example, users in the sudo group can run `sudo apt update`.
