About LESS

CSS is a language that decorates html, separating information and expression and having many advantages.

However, there are some inconveniences.

For example, it is easy to write, but it is very difficult to maintain without developer tools.

Also, it does not have the same characteristics as variables or functions that are characteristic of dynamic language, so a large amount of code is often used.

To solve this problem, one of the technologies is lescss.

Less css helps to make css simpler and easier to maintain.

### What is LESS?

LESS is a language that extends to CSS by adding the ability of Script (variables, functions, operations, superposition, scope, etc.).

And LESS runs in both the client or server environment (node.js).

LESS is a CSS preprocessor that makes it easy, fast, and systematic to program CSS using variables or Nested Rules.

CSS preprocessors include LESS, SASS/SCSS, COMPASS, and others, among which programmed according to the grammar of LESS is called LESS.

And LESS is an extended version of CSS that is highly backward compatible and easy to learn because it uses the existing grammar of CSS.

Now let`s quickly recite how the grammar used in LESS is used.

I will explain more detailed grammar in another article, not in this posting.

### LESS variable

With variables, you can put values that are used in multiple places in one place them in one place.

It can also be used throughout the style sheet.

So when something needs to be fixed, just one line of code in the variable part can be modified at a time, making it easier to work.

```css
@color: #4D926F;

#header {
color: @color;
}
h2 {
color: @color;
}
```

```css
#header {
color: #4D926F;
}
h2 {
color: #4D926F;
}
```

### LESS Mix in (Mixins)

Mixin allows you to include all the attributes of another class by naming them as one property name within one class.

It`s like variables, but it actually means the class as a whole class.

Mix-in also accepts variables like functions.

Take a look at the following examples:

```css
.rounded-corners (@radius: 5px) {
border-radius: @radius;
-webkit-border-radius: @radius;
-moz-border-radius: @radius;
}

#header {
.rounded-corners;
}
#footer {
.rounded-corners(10px);
}
```

```css
#header {
border-radius: 5px;
-webkit-border-radius: 5px;
-moz-border-radius: 5px;
}
#footer {
border-radius: 10px;
-webkit-border-radius: 10px;
-moz-border-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Rules about nesting or inclusion used by LESS

Instead of creating a long selector for CSS attribute inheritance (#headerpa {... }, LESS can include one selector within another.

This allows for much simpler CSS attribute inheritance and shorter style sheets.

```css
#header {
h1 {
font-size: 26px;
font-weight: bold;
}
p { font-size: 12px;
a { text-decoration: none;
```

```css
#header h1 {
font-size: 26px;
font-weight: bold;
}
#header p {
font-size: 12px;
}
#header p a {
text-decoration: none;
}
#header p a:hover {
border-width: 1px;
}
```

### LESS Functions and Operations

If some elements in the style sheet are proportional to others, you can use and define mathematical operators.

Operations allow you to define complex relationships between attributes by adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing attribute values and color values.

And the function allows you to create any attribute value you want by providing one-on-one response to the JavaScript code.

```css
@the-border: 1px;
@base-color: #111;
@red: #842210;

#header {
color: @base-color * 3;
border-left: @the-border;
border-right: @the-border * 2;
}
#footer {
color: @base-color + #003300;
border-color: desaturate(@red, 10%);
}
```

```css
#header {
color: #333;
border-left: 1px;
border-right: 2px;
}
#footer {
color: #114411;
border-color: #7d2717;
}
```

Among the LESS codes above, `desaturate()` is a function built into LESS.

We`ve only looked at some of the LESS grammar so far, and we`ll explain it step by step in another posting.
