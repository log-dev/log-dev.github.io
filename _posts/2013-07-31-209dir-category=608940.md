### hddtemp (hard temperature measurement)

For a typical HDD, the temperature is included in the S.M.A.R.T. information, so the temperature of that HDD can be determined using htttemp.

```bash
sudo apt-get install hddtemp

```

When installing, ask if the daemon will always run so that it can be connected from outside and check the temperature. Alternatively, you can set it up with the command below.

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure hddtemp

```

```bash
sudo hddtemp /dev/sda

```
