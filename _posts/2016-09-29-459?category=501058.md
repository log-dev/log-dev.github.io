null

`null` is a JavaScript literal representation of null or empty values.

This means that the object value does not exist. It is also one of the primitives of JavaScript.

### Syntax Description

null is literal. (not a property of a global object such as undefined).

In the API, null is often found where an object is expected but there is no such object.

When checking `null` or `undefined`, be aware of the difference between equal (==) and identification (===) operators (type conversion uses electrons).

```js
foo does not exist. Undefined and never initialized:
> foo
"ReferenceError: foo is not defined"

// know that foo exists, but there is no type or value:
> var foo = null; foo
"null"
```

The difference between null and undefined

```js
'type of null // object (bug in ECMAScript, must be null)
typeof undefined // undefined
null === undefined // false
null == undefined // true
```
