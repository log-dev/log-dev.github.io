Layout Design - Floating

Regarding Viewport, let`s look at the `float` and `clear` properties for dealing with layouts.

### Float Layout

Learn about Floating, a typical layout technique, and learn about the `clear` attributes associated with this property.

Normal Layout Flow

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="371" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/GPgdyY?height=371&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=GPgdyY&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=normal%20layout&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="normal layout" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_GPgdyY"></iframe>

The general layout flow is that the CSS is listed from top to bottom on a non-reflected screen.
In the HTML code markup above, after the <h1> element, the titles and paragraphs appear in the order of the <p> element.
This is how the web browser interprets HTML documents and draws them on the screen.

Floating Layout

The CSS `float` property is a property that is used a lot especially in the process of layout design within domestic practice.

The core attributes needed to construct complex layouts that allow certain elements to float, flow, and enrich.

In other words, a layout technique that uses the float property to "rich" the box left (left) or right (right).

The meaning `rich` here refers to the element moving away from the basic flow of document placement and the edge of the element moving to the left or right of the page.

This floating model provides flexibility in screen placement regardless of document flow.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="441" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/dwPKJL?height=441&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=dwPKJL&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=%ED%94%8C%EB%A1%9C%ED%8C%85%20%EC%83%98%ED%94%8C&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="플로팅 샘플" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_dwPKJL"></iframe>

```css
.box {
float: value;
}
```

The following is the property value of float:

- left : set element to float in left direction
- right : set element to float right
- none : default, do not float element.

### Clear - Floating Release Technique

Because the plotted elements are out of the document`s flow, you will see a phenomenon that breaks down the layout.
This is what happens when you use plots and you need to release float to solve these problems.

where "release float" means not releasing elements with float applied.
This means that the clear property is applied so that it is not affected by float.

There is a method called `clearfix` which is a globally accepted name (the name of a tolerable technique).

Of course, you can turn off the plot in a different way than applying the `clear` attribute, but if you use float to get the layout, we recommend that you apply the clearfix method to the parent element of the plotted element as much as possible.

In other words, there are approximately six ways to solve the phenomenon in which the parent element cannot embrace the child element with `float`.
One of the most popular methods is `clearfix`.

In other words, the clearfix method is not unconditional but necessary.

```css
.clearfix { clear: value; }
```

The value of the `clear` property is as follows:

- left : Unspecified floating element on the left
- right : unspecified floating element on right
- bot : Unspecified elements that are both left and right floated
- none : default, do not disable floating

Look before and after releasing plots

To turn off the first float

```css
.parent { float: left; }
```

If the plotted element is a child element, the parent element will look like a collapsed layout due to its inability to wrap the child element (out of document flow). This is what happens when a plot is used, and to solve this problem, it is necessary to ensure that the plot is not affected.

In other words, if the parent element contains a plotted child element, the parent element is not aware of the height.

One of the solutions to this problem is to reflect the float property on the parent (contingent element) as well.

This will make the parent element aware of the height of the child element, but the parent element also becomes a float element and has the characteristics of the inline block, so it should be used contextually according to the visual design layout.

To turn off the second float

This method also applies to parent elements by using the attribute `display:inline-block;`.

The parent element becomes aware of the height of the child element, but because of the inline block attribute characteristics defined in the parent element, it is only as wide as its own area.

```css
.parent { display: inline-block; }
```

To release the third float

The third property to turn off the plot is the `overflow:hidden;` method.

This property should also be applied to parent elements, which are characterized by the properties that hide the contents of the child element box and make it invisible if the child element is larger than the parent element box.

You can apply `overflow: auto;`, but it is not recommended because scrolling occurs when the width of the child element box is greater than the width of the parent element box.

It`s a property that hides overflowing things according to overflow characteristics, and it also contains other meanings.

Hiding overflowing content means that the parent element box hides the child element content.

However, when the parent element is not aware of the height due to the plotted child element, the `overflow: hidden;` attribute is applied, and the parent element (containment box) tries to hide the excess element and automatically calculates the height to recognize the child element height.

```css
.parent { overflow: hidden; }
```

To turn off the fourth float

This approach has a method of applying the clear attribute by creating an empty element as the last element (brother level) of an element plotted in the way that was widely used in the past (now the sun).

```undefined
<div class="box-group">
<div class="box is-blue"></div>
<div class="box is-yellow"></div>
<div class="box is-green"></div>
<div class="clear"></div>
</div>
```

To release the fifth float

One of the most widely used techniques we`ve introduced is how to use CSS` virtual (Sudo-class, pseudo-class) classes.

The method we introduced earlier required the creation of unnecessary meaningless elements, but this method is to disable float by creating empty virtual elements through CSS.

Use `:after` among the virtual elements of CSS.

```css
.parent:after {
content: "";
display:block;
clear:both;
}
```

To release the sixth float

The last way I introduce you is a technique called micro clearfix.

This method was first introduced through the HTML5 Boiler Plate template engine as a micro clearfix hack designed by CSS research expert Nicholas Gallagher.

It was designed in 2011, but has since become popular with bootstrap (Ver.1-3).

```css
.parent {
/* For IE 6/7 only */
*zoom: 1;
}
.parent:before,
.parent:after {
content: "";
display: table;
}
.parent:after {
clear:both;
}
```

### at the end

So far, we`ve looked at how to place the box in relation to the viewport and its properties to solve the resulting problem.
The methods related to CSS layout are position properties, but the next-generation techniques such as flexbox and grid are in vogue, so please take a look.
