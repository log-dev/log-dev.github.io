If Ubuntu (Linux) is used as a client/desktop, the method of installing Git is the same as the method of installing Git servers. It is divided into local Git and remote Git depending on whether it gives `--bare` option or not when it creates storage.

### Ubuntu Git Installation

Installing the Git package from Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-core

```

Install the latest version using Ubuntu PPA

If `add-apt-repository` command that is used to use PPA does not work, `python-software-properties` can be installed, and if there is a problem, `software-properties-common` can be installed.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core
git version

```

### Ubuntu Git Settings

User information is required when using Git.

```bash
git config --global user.name "unclepapa"
git config --global user.email "unclepapa@gmail.com"

```

When executing the Git command, the screen to be printed is set to be more colorful way.

```bash
git config --global color.ui "auto"

```

ssl validation is not performed by clients when using private certificates

```bash
git config --global --bool --add http.sslVerify false

```

Set the Http POST request buffer size.

```bash
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000

```

UTF-8 Settings (Only in Window Environment)

The default encoding for git`s commit message is utf-8. Windows needs to change the encoding of commit and log messages to cp949 because the default encoding for command prompts is cp949.

```bash
git config --global i18n.commitEncoding cp949
git config --global i18n.logOutputEncoding cp949

```

In addition, msysGit uses the less command to output log messages to the console, which also requires changing the character set to properly show the less command.

```bash
set LESSCHARSET=latin1

```

If you want to set the environment variable value permanently, you must add LESSCHARSET to the system environment variable and set latin1 as the value.

The associated setup file is stored in the user`s home directory as a file named .gitconfig.

### Ubuntu SSH-Key Registration

Unix and MAC families, such as Ubuntu, support ssh-keygen. You can select and create according to the symbols such as storage location and password generation.

```bash
ssh-keygen

```

When using remote storage or GitHub/GitLab, one of these keys can send id_rsa.pub to the administrator.

### Install Git in Windows

In Windows, you can install msysgit and tortoisegit to use Git. If you are going to use it as a text command (CLI), you only need to install msysgit, and to use the GUI, you can install the totoisgit together.

Download msysgit: https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list

Download and install the latest version (Git-version-preview date.exe). The installation can be installed as the default default.

Options with an option in the middle

If you right click on the desktop or folder after the installation is complete and the command is added as shown below, installation is successful. If it does not appear, reboot.

When msysgit is installed and Git Bash is executed, a command prompt appears. From this point on, it is possible to use the same command as the Git setting in Ubuntu above.

The setting of furnace is the same, and ssh-keygen is supported, so you can register it in the same way.

tortoisegit 다운 : https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/wiki/Download?tm=2

Tortoisegit also supports Korean language packs. If necessary, you can download it and change the language in the setup window.

설치중 TortoiseGitPLink, comming from Putty, integrates with Windows better 를 선택

When the installation is complete, right-click like msysgit to get a menu related to TortoiseGit.

You can set preferences by right-clicking into Tortoisgit > Setting.

[General]

If you downloaded and installed the desired language from this tab, you can change the language.

You can select the font for the log message in the Dialogs section.

[Diff Viewer]

This tab lets you select which tools to use as Diff Viewer and which to use as Merge Tool.

In addition to the basic designation, if you have a tool that you usually use, you can select and designate External here.

[Git]

This tab lets you set up userName and Email for users.

It also provides a function that allows users to import and edit preference files.

In the Remote section, registered remote stores are output, where you can specify putty keys.(Private)

Because tortoisegit uses ssh using putty (selecting at installation), keys generated by ssh-keygen cannot be used immediately. The key must be registered using the Puttygen installed together during installation.

[Start > Programs > TotoiseGit > Puttygen]

- Press the Generate button and generate the key.
- Moving the mouse around produces a random key.
- Save the private key with the Save private key button.
- Save the public key button to save the public key.
- Sends the public key to the storage administrator.
- When pushing to remote storage, select where the private key is stored in the Remote section of the Setting tab.

* If you already have a key created by ssh-keygen or any other method, you can convert this private key to puttygen by loading it into puttygen. It is a way to load the desired file and save it again.
