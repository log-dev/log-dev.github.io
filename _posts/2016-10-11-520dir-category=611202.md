Windows 10 provides update and installation tools and ISO images. If you need a related ISO image and switch between torrents and other webhards, we recommend downloading and using the latest official version provided by Microsoft.

### Download Windows 10

The link below is the official Microsoft link.

- DOWN #1: This link allows you to install Windows 10 directly on your PC or create USB/DVD for installation/boot via the media creation tool.
- DOWN #2: This link allows you to download the desired version of the ISO file immediately.

Below is a description of the DOWN #1 link, and if you downloaded the ISO directly, please refer to USB driver creation - Rufus.

### Create Windows 10 installation media

Download and run MediaCreationTool.exe from the DOWN #1 link by selecting Download Tools Now.

The goal is to create installation media, so let`s select Create installation media for another PC and select the version to install. By default, it is selected based on the PC currently in the process of installation, and you can choose the version you want by disabling the recommended option on this PC.

When USB is selected, it becomes a bootable Windows installation file, and when an ISO file is selected, it can be later created as an installation file through a different method. Let`s choose the appropriate enclosure and proceed.

As long as Microsoft provides a link, you don`t need to prepare ISO files for installation, you can simply select them in order, so you can create installation media very easily. However, there is a disadvantage of not being able to create UEFI installation media for GPT partitions because it is impossible to select other options when installing.
