Sublime text seems to be a philosophy to avoid using the mouse, but there are some inconveniences until you get used to it. There are also very few functions that can be performed in Sidebar, so you need to expand them for more convenience.

### SideBarEnhancements 소개

It provides enhancements to files and folders on the sidebar. In particular, it provides moving to trash, opening to installed programs, and clipboard. Various functions such as new files, new folders, modifications, opening and running, and opening with new windows continue to be added. You can also display the date the file was modified, the size of the file on the status bar page.

### SideBarEnhancements 설치

- After executing the sublime text, command Palette is recalled with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P.
- Select Package Control: Install Package, which is automatically completed when `install` is entered, and press Enter.
- Enter `encoding` to select SideBar Enhancements when they are detected, then press Enter to install them.

### SideBarEnhancements F12 Key

The F12 key no longer works after version 2.122104. This should be added passively to the shortcut.

The F12 key can now open the file in a browser.

- url_testing sets the URL of the local server with the F12 key.
- url_production sets the URL of the server to be served with the Alt + F12 key.

- Right-click on any file in the sidebar: "Project > Edit Projects Preview URLs"
- Add the path and URL in the following structure:
`{
"S:/www/domain.tld":{
"url_testing":"http://testing",
"url_production":"http://domain.tld"
},
"C:/Users/luna/some/domain2.tld":{
"url_testing":"http://testing1",
"url_production":"http://productiontld2"
}
}
`

Let`s say there is a project with the following structure.

```undefined
Project/ < - root project folder
Project/libs/
Project/public/ < - the folder we want to load as "http://localhost/"
Project/private/
Project/experimental/ < - other folder we may run as experimental/test in another url "http://experimental/"

```

Then create the configuration file:

```undefined
Project/.sublime/SideBarEnhancements.json

```

```json
{
"public/":{
"url_testing":"http://localhost/",
"url_production":"http://domain.tld/"
},
"experimental/":{
"url_testing":"http://experimental/",
"url_production":"http://domain.tld/"
},
"":{
"url_testing":"http://the_url_for_the_project_root/",
"url_production":"http://the_url_for_the_project_root/"
}
}

```

You can create a setup file with the path of `some/folder/.sublime/SideBarEnhances.json`.

From sublime text3, the F12 key became the shortcut to the "goto_definition" command. The F12 key used by this plug-in is not being used due to overlapping keys and must be registered. Preferences > package settings > side bar > key bindings - Go to user of amendments.

```undefined
[
{ "keys": ["f12"],
"command": "side_bar_open_in_browser" ,
"args":{"paths":[], "type":"testing", "browser":""}
},
{ "keys": ["alt+f12"],
"command": "side_bar_open_in_browser",
"args":{"paths":[], "type":"production", "browser":""}
},
{
"keys": ["ctrl+t"],
"command": "side_bar_new_file2"
},
{
"keys": ["f2"],
"command": "side_bar_rename"
},
]

```

### Notes on the Open With menu

정의 파일 : `User/SideBarEnhancements/Open With/Side Bar.sublime-menu`

Right-click any file in the project and select Open With > Edit Applications...

```undefined
//application 1
{
"caption": "Photoshop",
"id": "side-bar-files-open-with-photoshop",
"command": "side_bar_files_open_with",
"args": {
"paths": [],
"application": "Adobe Photoshop CS5.app", // OSX
"extensions":"psd|png|jpg|jpeg", //any file with these extensions
"args":[]
}
"open_automatically" : true // will close the view/tab and launch the application
},

```

### Search saved my life...

The plug-in also includes search capabilities. including the ability to search for text in a file.

> Not long ago, I was working on changing the old version of jQuery (1.8.3) to the latest jQuery. There were about 1,800 project files, but it was difficult to determine the cause of the error while modifying only the noticeable places, so I opened each file. After repeating the same task for about two hours, I suddenly looked it up because I thought there might be a search function in the sub-lime text, and the plug-in included the function.

Of course, the project was converted to the use of jQueryMigrate, but it was able to avoid being silly. Try it yourself!
