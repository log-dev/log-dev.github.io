The placeholder property of HTML5 is used to provide the correct hints for the input and textarea elements. However, there is a difference in the way it works when the corresponding element is focused on each browser. Explain how to unify them into one.

### Hide Focus Like IE

In IE, the placeholder letter disappears immediately when the input element is in focus, but other browsers need to receive the focus and actually enter the letter before the placeholder letter disappears. Consider implementing this to be unified in the same way as IE.

By organizing the contents of the link above, it can be processed by inserting the css as shown below.

```css
input:focus::-webkit-input-placeholder,
textarea:focus::-webkit-input-placeholder { /* WebKit browsers */
color:transparent;
}

input:focus:-moz-placeholder,
textarea:focus:-moz-placeholder { /* Mozilla Firefox 4 to 18 */
color:transparent;
}

input:focus::-moz-placeholder,
textarea:focus::-moz-placeholder { /* Mozilla Firefox 19+ */
color:transparent;
}

input:focus:-ms-input-placeholder,
textarea:focus:-ms-input-placeholder { /* Internet Explorer 10+ */
color:transparent;
}

```

A method that has long been customary in Korea is the same treatment as IE. The above code would be helpful if it had to be unified because it could not find a way to implement IE in the other browser`s way.

> In my personal opinion, I prefer the way a browser other than IE works, which does not disappear until the actual letter is entered, even if the focus is on the form.

If the placeholder effect is being implemented using a label rather than a placeholder attribute, the JavaScript event may be interested in the input event that responds to the actual input value. Of course, we'll have to come up with an alternative plan for the old IE, but... I will post about it later.
