## Tables – table,caption, col, tr, th, td 등..

Tables are useful components for listing information on the X-axis and Y-axis.
The table must have a title `captions` to provide information to the user, and below it are the elements that the corresponding body of the table needs. The following code is a simple table structure:

```undefined
<table>
Title of the <captions> table </captions>
<col width="20"><col>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" ></th>
<th scope="col" ></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tfoot>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tfoot>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
```

### Table element

The <table> corresponds to the table body and includes rows/columns and cells.
Use tables to structure complex content along the x and y axes for ease of understanding.
The best table design is to organize tables as simply as possible, do not nest tables in tables and do not use tables for layout (placement) purposes.
You can draw borders using the border property as the attribute value in the table, but it is recommended that you replace it with CSS.

### capture element

<captions> must be explicitly given as the title of the table, and the author must provide information to understand the contents of the table.
`captions` should be declared immediately after the `table` element, and if the title of the table should not be expressed in the UI, it can be hidden by applying a blind style.

If the table contents are complicated and need clarification, you must select one of the methods listed below to describe it.

To add a description (summary footnotes)

- Use the aria-describedby property to link a descriptive paragraph (paraph)
- Use the aria-labeledby attribute to associate a caption with the `figure` element

### tr(table row) element

refers to the row of the table, which contains the cell title (th - table heading) and the cell contents (td - table data) inside.

### th(header cell in a table) 요소

<th> must be included inside the row (tr) as the table cell title.

The following properties are available for the th element:

- scope : specifying that it is the title of row or column (col), rowgroup, columngroup
- abbr : Used when Abbreviation is required due to long title
- colspan : Used to group columns
- rowspan : Used to group rows

### td (table data) element

The <td> element must be contained within a row (tr) as the table cell contents (data cell in a table.

The following properties are available for td elements:

- colspan : Used to group columns
- rowspan : Used to group rows
- Headers : Used to connect at least one cell title to make it easier to read

### Thead element

Used when configuring as column heads within a row block of tables, and as an option. (Not Required)

### tbody element

Used when configuring with table data within a block of rows, as an option. (Not Required)

### tfoot element

Used when configuring with column summaries within row blocks, used as optional. (Not Required)

### Col Element

Used when you want to group one or more columns of tables, typically embedded within the `<colgroup>` element.
It can be used as an option, not required.

The following properties are available for the col element:

- span : Set number of column bundles

### colgroup element

Used when you want to create a table column group, you can include or do not include col elements inside.
It can be used as an option, not required.

The following properties are available for the colgroup element:

- span : set number of column bundles if colgroup element does not contain col

Let`s take a quick look at how to design structures when there are visual designs such as:

## Forms Components

Form elements are used to express user input forms.
Typically, this refers to a UI (User Interface) with the controls that users enter when they sign in or sign in.
In other words, form is a component of a web page that contains form controls such as text fields, buttons, and checkboxes.

Form elements are responsible for enabling Web documents to interact with each other, and `form` tags indicate the range of forms.

A form is an area consisting of different types of controls for user input (W3C is called a control for input fields, buttons, etc.). The starting and ending points of this area are defined by the form elements.

A form element is a block-level element that can also specify a whole document as a form or multiple forms within a document.

In other words, you can understand that this is a bowl for sending information that you have entered.

```undefined
<form method="get" action="http://www.example.com/addresscheck.html/">
<fieldset>

</fieldset>
</form>
```

- `form` tag specifies the form tag to which the fieldset element belongs.
- Specifying this property explicitly links the relationship between a particular form and a fieldset element.
- This connection makes it easier for the browser to interact with the two elements.
- The `fieldset` element indicates the relevant Form Field Set.
- A set of form fields refers to a group of related controls within a form.
- Form can be effectively stratified.
- `legend` element shall be used together.

The `action` property specifies the execution application.

The execution application requires the browser to know the location of the transfer (URL) to send the data to the server or program that processes the entered data, and uses the `action` attribute to do so.

At the front end, even if you do not know the property value for `action`, you should leave the property value blank and define it.

`method` has two ways of defining how data is transferred. For example, there is a get, post method in this method, just as there is a regular mail and a quick registered mail.

```undefined
<input type="text">

<select>
<option>Seoul</option>
<option>Incheon</option>
</select>

<textarea cols="5" rows="15"> </textarea>

<button type="button">도움말</button> 
```

### input element

```undefined
"<!-- Basic Use Example -->
<input type="text">

```

- `type="text" : The attribute text is the default value of the input element, and a text field is created to allow text to be entered.
- The vertical size of the text field is fixed and only the horizontal size can be set.
- The size is determined by the number of characters and the default size is 20.

### Label element

Because there are only boxes, such as input text elements, we don`t know what to do, so we have to give labels to input elements.

- Use the `label` element when you want to label the control (name).
- Labels are titles or names used to identify items or files.
- The `label` element must be used so that the browser knows the relationship between the label and the control.

```undefined
"<!-- explicit label -->
<label for="userName">이름 : </label>
<input type="text" name="" id="userName" value="김재희">
<!--> For example, it can be used in places such as tables. -->


[!-- Implicit label -->
= Implicit label <input type="text" name=""></label>


<!-- Example of using explicit and implicit labels -->
<label for="member">
<span>members</span>
<input type="text" name="" id="member">
</label>
<!--
The label processing method shown above shows that the text Member acts as a label text and groups it into span elements.
This element can be styled independently, and at the same time, the accessibility of the screen reader can be improved.
-->
```

for properties

The for attribute specifies the control associated with the label.

And methods that provide labels to controls are largely divided into implicit and explicit methods.

Implicit Label Declaration Method

- This method places controls within the label element.
- In other words, the control within the label element is considered relevant without having to disclose it.

Explicit Label Declaration Method

- This method uses the attribute for to accurately specify the id value of the control.
- That is, to clarify the fact that labels relate to certain controls.
- Clarifying means that mechanical connections are possible.
- This allows the browser to handle the associated controls being selected even if the user clicks on the label, and allows the relationship between the label and the control to be easily connected, even if they are separated from each other.

Property value of input

- name - used to transfer values to the server
- placeholder - used to give help to users on what words to type
- value - the value entered or received in the type element
- readonly - Read-only and not user-inputable (read-only)
- Required - If not entered as required, an error occurs when sending the server.
This is to say, for mandatory entries
- disabled - will be disabled and placed in a state where no action can be taken.
- minlength - to set the maximum length of the value that can be entered
- maxlength - set the minimum length of the value that can be entered

### Type(type)

text, password, checkbox, radio, file, submit, button, image, reset, hidden, search, url, tel, email, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, range, color

```undefined
'<!--Example of use -->
Enter the password = "password" placeholder="6 digits.">
<input type="submit" value="전송">
<input type="button" value="버튼">
<input type="image" src="https://goo.gl/Ng66oQ" alt="체크인" width="20" height="20">
<input type="reset" value="초기화">
<input type="hidden" name="using-ajax" value="true">

<input type="range" name="" id="" min="10" step="5" max="25" value="15">
<input type="color" name="" id="" value="#F7CC60">
```

type="submit"

- The property value submit is created by a transfer button.
- The transfer button only serves to send the form to the server, but how and where it is sent is determined by the form element.
- The button name is specified by the value property, which, if not specified, displays the name that the browser specifies.

type="reset"

- The property value reset is created with an initialization button. Initialization returns the value entered in the form to the initial value.

type="button"

- The property value button is made with a pushbutton.
- There are no basic functions for various purposes, and client-side scripts such as JavaScript are required to execute the function.
- The text entered as a value property is the button name, which appears above the actual button.

type="password"

```undefined
<label for="user_pass">비밀번호 : </label>
<input type="password" name="user_pass" id="user_pass" required placeholder="비밀번호 6자리를 입력해주세요." >
```

- `type="password" : A password field is created when the attribute value password is specified.
- It is indicated by a star or circle symbol so that it is not read on the screen.

type="file"

```undefined
<input type="file" name="" id="">
```

- `type="file" : File upload control is created when the attribute value is specified as file.
- The File Upload Control is a control for selecting files on a local computer and consists of a text field where the file name is entered and a button for calling the File Explorer.
- The accept property allows the browser to configure a file upload control so that only specified file types can be found.
- When transferring a file, the encoding type must be defined as `enctype=`multipart-formdata` in the form element, and the method method is used as POST.

type="checkbox"

```undefined
<input type="checkbox" name="nation" value="korea" checked="checked">한국
<input type="checkbox" name="nation" value="japan">일본

<label><input type="checkbox" name="nation" value="korea" checked="checked">동의하시겠습니까?</label>

```

- `type="checkbox" : A checkbox is created when a property value is specified as checkbox.
- The check box is an input control to determine whether it is selected or not, and the input state is divided into selected and unselected.
- The check box is a control for multi-selection and can be configured as multiple check boxes.
- At this time, the name property is required to inform the browser that it is a check box related to each other.
- The checkd property makes it selected.

type="radio"

```undefined
<input type="radio" name="rdo" id=""> 고양이
<input type="radio" name="rdo" id=""> 강아지

<label><input type="radio" name="gender" id="" checked> 남자</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="gender" id=""> 여자</label>

```

- `type="radio" : Radio button is created when the attribute value is specified as radio (radio button originating from the car).
- A radio button, like a check box, is a control to check whether it is selected or not. However, only a single choice is made that does not support duplicate selection.
- This means that they are used to select one of several items, which must be mutually exclusive.

list 와 datalist

The list attribute and the datalist element allow you to use the value of the option together.

```undefined
<label>이동할 웹주소 <input type="url" list="url_ex" name="user_url" id="user_url"></label>
<datalist id="url_ex">

```

- Data list element container control.
- Create items using `option` element inside.

type="tel"

```undefined

<input type="color" name="" id="" value="#f7cc60">
```

### Button Element

The button form control receives the user`s interaction and triggers the action.

By default, this button element is set to `type="submit" if no type is specified.

```undefined
<button type="submit">전송</button>
<button type="button">버튼</button>
<button type="reset">초기화</button>

<option value="1" selected>축구</option>
<option value="2" label="basketball" disabled>농구</option>
<option value="3">독서</option>
£option value="3">Watch a movie</option>
</select>
```

Select elements are called select boxes, combo boxes, and drop-down menus and are used to select from several items. Use `select` and `option` elements together.
The `select` element displays the selection control and the option element displays the option item. It is usually used when there are many restrictions on space, and it is designed by the planning team. If not, you can express it with the radio button. In other words, the selection control is a control for selecting OPTION elements and is designed to make the option list available like a menu.

- name - Value required when sending to server
- Multiple - Multiple selectable properties
- disabled - disabled
- required - required input
- size - set the number of options displayed on the screen

option

- The option element displays an option list.
- The option list is a collection of items that users can choose from.
- It cannot contain any other elements and may only contain text.
- Use the optgroup element to group > into groups.

selected

- The selected property specifies the preselected option.
- The list of options is listed on a certain basis and provided with the first option selected by default.
- If you want to change these default choices, you can specify the selected property.

value

- The `value` property specifies the value sent to the server.
- If this property is not specified, the marked-up text in the option element is sent to the server.

```undefined
<select>
<optgroup label="Swedish Cars">
<option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
<option value="saab">Saab</option>
</optgroup>
<optgroup label="German Cars">
<option value="mercedes" label="벤츠" disabled>Mercedes</option>
<option value="audi">Audi</option>
</optgroup>
</select>
```

optgroup element

- The `optgroup` element displays the Option Group.
- An option group is a group created by a group of one or more options.
- If the number of options is high, grouping similar options improves convenience.
- `optgroup` element consists of parent element and option element is composed of child element.
- Specifying `label` properties results in a label for an option group.

### textarea element

```undefined
<div>
<label for="user_comments">코멘트</label>
<textarea name="user_comments" id="user_comments" cols="30" rows="10">
Please write down what you want to say.
</textarea>
</div>
```

This textarea element refers to a multi-line plain text editing control. That is, if the input type text is one line, this element is an input box that can set multiple lines.

The properties used by this element include name, placeholder,rows, cols, readonly, required, disabled, minlength, and maxlength.

### Fieldset, Legend Element

Available when you group one or more form controls.
The fieldset title can be used to set the label (name) of the control using the legend element.

```undefined
<form method="POST" action="/">
<fieldset>
<legend>User Account</legend>
<input type="text" name="user_name" id="user_name" placeholder="이름을 입력해 주세요.">

</fieldset>
</form>
```

### Output, Progress, Meter Element

The output element is the controlling element that outputs the calculated results.

You can use the name, for property for this element.

The progress element is an element that is used to visually display the progress of a task completion.

The meter element is a control ((gauge) element that represents the scalar measurement or distribution ratio within a known range, which can be used to express disk usage, relevance of query results, turnout for a particular candidate, etc.

```undefined
<form oninput="result_sum.value = parseInt(n1.value, 10) + parseInt(n2.value, 10)">
<p>
<input type="number" name="n1" value="4"> +
<input type="number" name="n2" value="10"> =
<output name="result_sum">14</output>
</p>

<!-- 30 filled out of 100% set to max -->
<p>
<progress value="30" max="100">30%</progress>
