Recently, mail servers use a lot of postfixes that can be easily set up easily. Use this to learn how to install a mail server and send mail using Google`s SMTP.

### Installing required packages

Install packages and authentication tools for mail testing

Some of them may already be installed...

```bash
sudo apt-get install mailutils libsasl2-2 ca-certificates libsasl2-modules

```

Install Postfix Mail Server

You can select a few during installation, such as selecting Internet Site, setting up your own domain, such as mail.example.com

```bash
sudo apt-get install postfix

```

### Postfix Settings

Postfix Settings

```bash
sudo vi /etc/postfix/main.cf

```

Paste the contents below at the bottom

```undefined
relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
smtp_use_tls = yes

```

create sasl_passwd file and create gmail account and password in this file

```bash
sudo vi /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

```

USERNAME@gmail.com:Enter your Gmail account and password in the PASSWORD section

If you are using Google Apps to use the domain, you can use the @domain address instead of @gmail.com.

```undefined
[smtp.gmail.com]:587 USERNAME@gmail.com:PASSWORD

```

Change Permissions and Update Postfix Settings

```bash
sudo chmod 400 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd

```

Run the command below to avoid certificate errors

```bash
cat /etc/ssl/certs/Thawte_Premium_Server_CA.pem | sudo tee -a /etc/postfix/cacert.pem

```

Restart Postfix

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/postfix reload

```

### Test Mail

Enter the address to send mail to you@example.com

```bash
echo "Test mail from postfix" | mail -s "Test Postfix" you@example.com

```

If you send an e-mail like this, it will be sent to the e-mail of your Google account, leaving a history in the mailbox you sent. However, there are 500 e-mail transmission restrictions per day.

### Mail Aliases

I want to receive various errors or messages that can occur in the system, but I can forward them to other e-mails without checking them in the system.

Receive mail delivered to root users under a different mail account

```bash
sudo vi /etc/aliases

root: system@example.com

```

Recreate Aliases DB

```bash
sudo newaliases

```

### Troubleshooting

The domain uzuro.com was set when postfix was installed, and uzuro.com was set in my destination value. When sending mail locally using Google SMTP, the system`s local address is recognized as uzuro.com.

For example, if you send a mail from the system to webmaster@uzuro.com, it finds the webmaster in the system account and sends the mail. What I wanted was to send e-mails to places I set up for Naver Works and Google Apps, but it did not deviate from the system.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/postfix/main.cf

```

After deleting the uzuro.com portion of the value of my destination, the mail was sent to the address set up in Naver Works without looking for an e-mail account inside the system.
