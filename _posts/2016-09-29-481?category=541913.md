transition (gradual effects using screen movement)

The transform effect is also interesting, but when combined, such as the transition feature in CSS3, it gives greater effect and vitality.

The dictionary meaning of transition means "transition, fulfillment," but it is easy to understand that it means "screen movement."

You can say that transition refers to the state of the middle of the transformation.

In other words, the state during a transformation is called screen movement, and you can specify a time for it.

For example, if you want to cause some variation when you over-react the mouse, you can think of it as using it to control the condition.

### transition

To use transition, there are a few things you need to be aware of.

- I need two styles.

> The first style is the element's "initial state" and the second style is the element's "final state".
For example, assuming that the first style is red button style and the second style is blue button style, the web browser creates a gradual screen movement effect from the first state (style) to the second state (style).

- transition property

> CSS3 provides the transition property, which creates an animation effect.
In general, the transition property is usually defined in the initial state style of the design.

- Trigger

> An action that causes a change between the two styles, the initial state and the final state.
In CSS, animation can be started using several virtual classes, the most widely used is the ':over' class.
That is, the moment a visitor places a mouse cursor over an element, it starts the animation effect.
Virtual classes such as ':active' (with element clicked), ':target' (with element as the destination of link), and ':focus' (with tab moved focus to link or form field clicked) can also be used as triggers.
You can also use javascript to dynamically change the style of any tag.

When the trigger is no longer in effect, i.e. when the user overwrites the mouse over the button and then overcomes (out of the button), the browser reverts the tag style to its initial state and animates the screen movement.

In other words, the screen movement effect only needs to be applied to the element once, and the browser will take care of the process of going from the initial state style to the final state style and restoring it again.

Screen movement and transition properties

There are four attributes that control `properties to process animation`, `time to process animation`, `type of animation`, and `time to start animation`.

- `Transition-duration` : Time taken to reflect the CSS effect, i.e. time taken to end the screen movement
- `Transition-timing-function` : acceleration or deceleration over time
- `Transition-delay`: Time delay
- `Transition-property`: Specifying this value as a property that is affected by the screen movement will have a screen movement effect only for certain items.

transition-property: keyword 과 transition-duration: time

The `transition-property` property is the property that determines which property to apply the transition effect to the Web element.

In addition, `duration` is a property that specifies how long it takes for a screen movement to end, and you can attach ms (milliseconds, 1/1000th of a second) or s (second) units to the value that will be applied in time.

For example, 1,000 ms equals 1s and 1.25s 1250 ms.

Because the default value for the transition period is 0, you must give a duration value to implement the screen movement effect.

The following is a simple example code for transition-property, transition-duration:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="247" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/OXdaJQ?height=247&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=OXdaJQ&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_OXdaJQ"></iframe>

The first demo-01 specified a font-size as property. As mentioned above, there must be a duration value to implement the screen movement effect.

If the duration value is not specified and only transition-property is specified, it will not be different from the state that the font size has grown rapidly when :hover, which can be implemented simply with CSS 2.1 level.

And if you look at demo-02, only `transition-duration: 2s;` is declared.

Because the transition-property is declared all by default, all properties have that screen-moving (switching) effect.

Note that if only transition-duration is set, the transition effect is present, but vice versa, no transition effect will be created.

The attributes of the CSS that can be specified to be affected by the `transition-property` property are as follows:

- background-color, background-position, border-color, border-spacing, border-width
- bottom, top, left, right
- color, clip, crop, font-size, font-weight
- height, width, max-height, max-width, min-height, min-width
- margin, padding
- letter-spacing, line-height, text-indent, text-shadow, opacity
- vertical-align, visibility, word-spacing, z-index

There`s a back.

Acceleration processing using transition-timing-function

Incremental acceleration or deceleration can be specified for CSS effects, which can be more impressive.

This means that you can use the `transition-timing-function` property to control the effectiveness of an element during screen movement, which is a typical keyword:

- Linear : constant velocity
- ease-in : acceleration
- ease-out: deceleration
- ease: Incremental acceleration
- case-in-out: deceleration after gradual acceleration

This property value lets you set how fast the screen will move during the duration of the screen movement and adjust the animation speed.

In addition to the above keywords used for this purpose, there is also a cubic-bezier function.

The default value starts slowly as an ease, then accelerates quickly, and ends slowly again.

When the `linear` value is applied, the flow remains constant from beginning to end without changing the speed of the transition process.

Using the `ease-in` value causes the animation to start slowly and end in a fast flow, and using the `ease-out` value causes the opposite.

The last `ease-in-out` is similar to the ease because it starts slowly and then speeds up at the midpoint and ends up slowing down again, but the degree of change is not as rapid as in the case of the ease.

For a more specific understanding of the time function, consider adding the time function to the example code at the top as follows:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="215" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/Vjgggj?height=215&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=Vjgggj&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_Vjgggj"></iframe>

If you have looked at the example code above, you may not have noticed any difference.

The `timing` attribute that you set for screen movement is often rarely seen by users.

This difference can be felt more clearly when you move a lot from side to side on the screen or when the duration is long.

So let`s make the following screen and see what actually works.

We`ve processed it using a little JavaScript, so please click anywhere in the following screen area.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="698" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/akXXgb?height=698&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=akXXgb&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_akXXgb"></iframe>

Tertiary Bezier Curve

Another value that can be applied to `transition-timing-function` is the cubic-bezier function.

The grammar of the third cubic Bezier curve is as follows:

```css
.selector {
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2);
}
```

The tertiary Vezier curve is made of four points that exist on the grid, with coordinates from 0 to 1 along both axes.

The four points are called p0, p1, p2, and p3, which are represented by two pairs of (x, y) coordinates, and can represent the degree of curvature (curve) depending on their location.

At this point, the first point (p0) defines in the function two other points, (1,0) the last point (p3) is (1, 1) and p1 is (x1, y1) and p2 (x1, y1).

p0, p3 always means the same value, so you don`t need to specify it separately.

.selector { transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.6, 0.1, 0.15, 0.8); }

Please refer to the picture of the 3rd Vezier curve as follows.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/254B454A57B1EAB617)

The `cubic-bezier` function is difficult to use when you are not familiar with mathematical calculations.

However, with online tools that generate coordinate values on the tertiary Bezier curve, you can easily identify and test different coordinate points.

And it`s easy to recognize in Chrome developer tools, so I think it`s enough to test acceleration and use the coordinates instead of thinking about it too much.

transition-delay: time (delay property)

The last property of the screen shift (transition, transition) effect is the `transition-delay` property that allows you to set when the transition occurs.

As in the `transition-duration` property, the time value of this property can also be set in ms or s.

The default value is zero, which causes a transition effect as soon as an event occurs, and entering a positive number in the time value results in a transition effect after that time has elapsed.

The following example can be set to have a transition effect after 2 seconds:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="224" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/JKxzNR?height=224&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=JKxzNR&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_JKxzNR"></iframe>

You can use negative numbers for `transition-delay`, and specifying a negative value can create a quite interesting effect.

If you apply a negative number to the delay property, the transition effect occurs immediately (immediately), but the animation is skipped for a set time (duration).

To determine the result, try setting a delay of -2 seconds for the transition effect that will last for 4 seconds as follows:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="221" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/YWBgxA?height=221&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=YWBgxA&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_YWBgxA"></iframe>

The above code will immediately start the transition effect after 2 seconds (the duration of the screen movement minus 2 seconds).

So if you run the example above, you can see that the transition effect starts from the middle.

### transition abbreviated grammar

Until now, the screen movement effect has been implemented by adding various attributes.

As you can abbreviate background properties among CSS properties to reduce multiple properties to a single line of code, you can also write transitions as follows:

```css
.selector {
transition: transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function transition-delay;
}
```

As shown above, you can create those values in order, and the first transition-property is a record of the affected properties, which you use to try to affect only certain properties.

Usually, all values are used a lot and are applied to all properties, so you can use them as default values.

The rest can be written in the order of duration → timing properties → latency as follows:

transition: all 1.0s ease-in 0.5s;

The point to note is that if the time values are transition-duration and transition-delay, and only one time value is declared, this is considered transition-duration value, and transition-delay is considered to use the default or inherited value.
