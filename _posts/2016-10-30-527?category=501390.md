Object Constants

JavaScript does not have constants, but in most modern browser environments, you can create constants through a `const` statement.

In a commonly used indirect way, naming conventions are used to capitalize all variable names whose values should not be changed.

This rule is actually used in JavaScript embedded objects.

```js
Math.PI; // 3.1415922653589793
Math.SQRT2; // 1.4142135623720951
Number.MAX_VALUE; // 1.7976931348623157e+308
```

You can apply the same naming convention to a user-defined constant to add it as a stat property to the constructor function.

```js
// constructor
var Widget = function () {
// Constructor Implementation Content...
};

// Constant
Widget.MAX_HEIGHT = 320;
Widget.MAX_WIDTH = 480;
```

You can apply the same naming conventions to objects that you create with object literature.

In other words, a typical capitalized property is considered a constant.

If you don`t want the value to change in practice, it`s also worth considering creating a private property and then providing only a method that returns the value without a setter.

In most cases, however, this method may be a bit excessive because simply naming conventions are sufficient.

An example to follow is an implementation of a universal `constant` object that provides the following methods:

- set(name,value): defines a new constant.
- isDefined(name): Check if there is a constant with a specific name.
- get(name): Gets the value of the constant.

In this example, only raw data types are allowed as constant values.

Also, to ensure that the name of the constant you want to declare does not overlap with the name of the built-in property such as `toString` or `hasOwnProperty`, you use `hasOwnProperty()`.

Finally, prefixes created with the names of all constants before them.

```js
var constant = function () {

var constants = {},
ownProp = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty,
allowed = {
string : 1,
number : 1,
boolean: 1
},
prefix = (Math.random() + "_").slice(2);

return {
set : function (name, value) {
if (this.isDefined(name)) {
return false;
}
if (!ownProp.call(allowed, typeof value)) {
return false;
}
constants[prefix + name] = value;
return true;
},
isDefined : function (name) {
return ownProp.call(constants, prefix + name);
},
get : function (name) {
if (this.isDefined(name)) {
return constants[prefix + name];
}
return null;
}
}

}();
```

Test them below.

```js
// Make sure that it is already defined.
console.log(constant.isDefined('maxwidth')); // false 가 기록

// define.
console.log(constant.set('maxwidth', 480)); // true 가 기록

// Try to define again.
console.log(constant.isDefined('maxwidth')); // true 가 기록

// Is the value the same?
console.log(constant.get('maxwidth')); // 480 이 기록
```
