There are three types of file access: read, write, and execute.

Each access can be defined separately for the original owner, file group, and other users of the file.

### Directory Permissions

The permissions in a directory are different from those in a regular file.

- x-bit: indicates that you can enter a folder using commands such as cd.
- Use commands such as r bits : ls to view directory lists.
- w bit : can create new files inside folder.
