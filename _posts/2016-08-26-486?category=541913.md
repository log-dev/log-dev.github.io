CSS3 3D Effect

What attracts the most attention in CSS3 is the natural screen effect associated with 3D.

So far, this 3D effect is not compatible with browsers, as is the transform and translate used in 2D, so vendor prefixes such as `-webkit-` are required to be implemented.

To express 3D effects, you can set properties for 3D, such as 2D effects, transform, transition, etc.

The most important setting for 3D effects is to specify a projection point.

### Set Projection Points for 3D Effects

Please refer to the following pictures of the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis to understand the 3D effect.

To give a 3D effect, it is important to understand how projection points affect the screen.

If the concept of projection points (or observer perspective, perspective, depth) is difficult, it can be understood that essentially objects that need to be far away are made small and objects that need to be near them are made large, giving them perspective.

Let`s take a look at the following examples:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="665" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/vKwjNk?height=665&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=vKwjNk&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_vKwjNk"></iframe>

The first box has no effect, and the second box has lotateX (45deg).

It looks like a smaller box because it was rotated X-axis in 2D.

The property for specifying projection points in the third box was declared as `-webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d; -webkit-perfect: 300px;`.

This property converts this element into a three-dimensional object, giving it a realistic depth.

In the example above, it should be noted that the property `-webkit-transform` was used to declare rotateX.

The attribute `-webkit-transform` is a term coined because of the deformation of the shape itself in the 3D effect.

Because the rotateX was used in the above setting, it rotates 45 degrees on the x-axis and has a depth of projection point, which means that the projection point was given 300px above, so it is easy to say that it is facing the wrapper area from the upper body as far as 300px.

And the most important thing here is that instead of setting a perceptive property (projection point) on a target element, such as an image, you have to set a projection point on an element that contains a transforming element.

This means that we apply it to the parents of the switched elements and that all their children will operate in the same 3D space from the same perspective.

However, if you want to apply 3D transition only to that element, you can do so.

To apply 3D only to that element, you can apply the value for the projection point (depth) differently, as shown in the code below.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="383" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/rLggdm?height=383&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=rLggdm&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_rLggdm"></iframe>

The following image is intended to help you understand projection points and transforms when you apply them.

Please refer to the following figure to help you understand projection points and coordinate axes.

There are two example codes that apply projection points above.

One is the application of projection points to the parent container and the other is the reflection of projection points to the target element.

You may not have noticed any difference in the example above, but using the perpective property for a container and using it for a target element produces fundamentally different results.

In particular, when a switched element has sibling elements associated with a 3D transition, it produces different results.

The following code will look at the difference between applying the perpective() function to individual elements and applying the perpective property to containers.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="906" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/JKqqZa?height=906&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=JKqqZa&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_JKqqZa"></iframe>

If you look at the results above, you will see different results when projection points are applied to the parent and when they are applied to the target element.

In particular, you can see that the transformation of sibling elements that reflect projection points on parent elements is reflected by influencing perspective between each other, not individual elements.

It is important to remember that the entire coordinate system of the element rotates when it comes to rotates.

This means that the elements are not directed in the direction the user is in, but have a z-axis pointing to a point that is actually angled 45 degrees from the screen.

With this in mind, make sure you understand the perceptive properties.

### The screen changes according to the depth setting of the projection point (change when moving)

In setting up a 3D effect, the projection point setting is almost absolute, and even if rotated equally, it will have different effects depending on the depth of the perspective.

In short, if you set the projection point to deep, it will have only a slight effect on the screen when the target is rotated, but shallow projection points will make the screen seem to rotate close by, so even a slight change in angle will have a significant effect.

We`ve rotated and reflected the projection points, but this time, we`ll move to translate and see how the 3D effect works.

The following code moves by 100px on the z-axis and reflects projection points on the parent element.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="487" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/xONoYo?height=487&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=xONoYo&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_xONoYo"></iframe>

If you move 100px along the z-axis without specifying a `perfect` value when you move an element, of course no visual changes will occur to the element.

In other words, it moves 100px along the z-axis, but it is not clear because there is no point of view to measure the distance.

So if you declare `perfect` on a container element to configure a 3D environment, you`ll see the above results.

The above results show that the element is growing in size as it moves closer to the observer.

It should be understood that the `translateZ()` function and the `perceptive` attribute operate on the same axis.

Examine the following images:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2660D73F57BD0C2A1E)

It is understood that the Z-axis in the above figure is on the same line as the observer`s point of view.

In the example, at the observer point where the projection point reflection is 500px away, the element is moved along the Z-axis by 100px, resulting in a visual effect such as a forward projection.

If the projection point setting is set to the observer position 500px away from the screen and the Z-axis for the target element moves 600px, the element will be invisible because it is located while moving to the "behind the observer.

So far, we`ve looked at the effect of projection points on the rotation and the Z-axis respectively, and now we`re going to look at the effect of rotating the angle and applying the translate at the same time with the projection points present.

If you apply this rotation and movement at the same time and reflect the projection point, the interesting thing is that there are quite different results depending on whether you rotate and move or move.

First, let`s move through the following example and learn about the case of rotation.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="504" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/qNGzGO?height=504&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=qNGzGO&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_qNGzGO"></iframe>

Click the button in the example above to see the result, and you will move 200px to the Y-axis and then rotate.

The visual effect is to rotate as you move, or to rotate as you move, but in reality, you move and then rotate.

That is, it works in the order in which it is declared in the code.

I don`t know if it`s hard to understand so far, but if you look at the following examples, it might be tilted.

The next example is the same effect as above, but we will declare the 2D effect to rotate and move the deformation effect the opposite way.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="452" width="100%" name="cp_embed_6" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/KrLjOG?height=452&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=KrLjOG&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_6" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_KrLjOG"></iframe>

If you check the results above, you can see a different effect, just changing the order of movement and rotation.

This is because it first rotates at an angle of 45 degrees and then moves 200px from the axis of rotation to the Y-axis.

Please refer to the following picture.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2636474857BD181733)

Let`s reflect the projection point with the x-axis tilted 45 degrees above and see what happens when you move along the Z-axis that we saw earlier.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="375" width="100%" name="cp_embed_7" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/pbmroq?height=375&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=pbmroq&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_7" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_pbmroq"></iframe>

The above results show a visual effect, such as popping forward on the screen, because the Z-axis setting, which moves back and forth with a 45 degree tilt, was first applied.

Also, if you understood the above Z-axis, you can understand that changing the Z-axis to Y-axis for movement in the example above is no different from the result that did not reflect the `perfect` projection point.

### conclusion

You will be able to achieve a spectacular (?) 3D effect with the projection points you`ve seen so far.

Next time, let`s have a time to make a shape that looks like a 3D effect by applying a 2D effect to the inner elements with the projection point set.

If this posting is difficult, please proceed after pre-learning the 2D effect such as transformation and transition of CSS3.
