# Webpack Preferences Preview

We`ve learned about the overall understanding of `Webpack` and the knowledge of the players needed to use the Webpack, and we`ll start with the basic environment configuration of `Webpack`.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99EF95505D4761271A)

User code creation and bundle js

### Project Initialization

From now on, we will initialize the new project and install Webpack.

If you haven`t installed node.js yet, please proceed after installation.

Webpack Basic (General) Configuration Procedures

- Global installation of `webpack` and `webpack-cli`
- Create package.json with `npm init`
- src/index.js 와 index.html 생성
- Add user js and html
- creating the webapck.config.js file

You can install `webpack` and `webpack-cli` as -global and then create a package.json and then install a webpack.

First, create your own new project folder within your local directory and try creating some files.

```bash
$ mkdir webpack-task
$ cd webpack-task
$ npm init -y
```

You can configure the directory using the CLI command, or you can configure the folder with the new project name and proceed with `npm init -y`.

Perform the command below as follows:

```bash
$ npm i webpack webpack-cli -global
$ npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev 
```

`webpack` is a core package of webpack and only `webpack` is installed until `v3`, but `webpack-cli` must be installed from `v4` of webpack. The `webpack-cli` is a command line tool that allows you to run the `webpack` command on a terminal and is dependent on developing both packages, so install them as `--save-dev`.

The `webpack` installation is also intended to recall and use the webpack module from the webpack.config.js file.

The local installation will create the node_modules folder, and there will be a number of modules installed in the subfolders.

You can also perform the commands that you performed directly above as shown below.

```bash
$ npm i -g webpack webpack-cli
```

Option flags ` -global (-g)`, `--save-dev (-D)` can be typed immediately after the install or entered after the last package name.

To determine which packages are installed, look at package.json as follows:

```json
{
"name": "webpack-task",
"version": "1.0.0",
"description": "",
"main": "index.js",
"scripts": {
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\"
```

Because `webpack` and `webpack-cli` are not real-world services, they are just tools for development, you can see the addition of `--save-dev` to devDependencies.

Next, create a simple index.html, index.js, and webpack.config.js file and create it as follows:

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Webpack Task</title>
</head>
<body>
<header>
hLearn to Webpack</h1>
</header>
<div>
<p>
In fact, webpack setup is notoriously complex, but it has the advantages of being able to handle a wide variety of tasks.
It continues to improve quickly and easily (?
</p>
</div>
<script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

```js
// index.js
console.log ('Run Webpack Bundling');
```

```js
// webpack.config.js
// webpack command starts with this setting by default
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
entry: './src/js/index.js',
output: {
filename: 'bundle.js',
path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
},
mode : 'development'
};
```

To date, the folder configuration is as follows:

```bash
webpack=task
|---index.html
|---package-lock.json
|---package.json
|---webpack.config.js
|
\---node_modules
| \-- Omit
|
\---src
\--js
\--index.js

```

Before we look at the configuration file `webpack.config.js`, let`s run the command below.

```bash
$ webpack
```

If you run the command above, you can see that dist/bundle.js.

And if you look at the bundled `bundle.js`, you can see the code related to the webpack and the console code written in `index.js` at the bottom, as follows:

```js
/***/ "./src/js/index.js":
/*!*************************!*\
!*** ./src/js/index.js ***!
\*************************/
/*! no static exports found */
/***/ (function(module, exports) {

eval("console.log('Webpack 번들링 실행');\n\n//# sourceURL=webpack:///./src/js/index.js?");

/***/ })
```

The actual action file is index.js, but you must recall and use bundle.js in index.html because you will use bundled resources during service (deployment).

This time, let`s take an example of a library called `jQuery` that we still use a lot.

It`s a preview (?) as we did before, but it can help you understand.

Install `jQuery` and try to modify `index.js` as shown below.

```bash
$ npm i jquery --save
```

```js
// index.js
console.log ('Run Webpack Bundling');

//require is the CommonJS keyword used by NodeJS.
// import is a newly introduced keyword in ES6 (ES2015).
// Both keywords have the same purpose of recalling code from one file to another
import $ from 'jQuery';

(function () {

$(document).ready(function() {
$('p').text('jQuery' is being loaded and used.')
});

})();

```

`import $ from `jQuery`;` means calling up jQuery in node_modules and replacing it with $.

If you perform the webpack command on the CLI again, you can check the index.html and see that the text in the paragraph has changed.

And there will be jquery and user scripts combined in bundle.js.

webpack.config.js (webpack configuration file)

In order to understand the core concept of `webpack`, let`s look at the main attributes of the configuration file, Entry, Output, Loader, Plugins, and mode, along with the examples we need.

### entry settings

This means the entry point for setting up the bundle.

In other words, the `entry` property is the first entry point and JavaScript file path required to convert web resources from a webpack.

- `String` : Interpreted as a module loaded at startup if a string is incoming
- `Array` : All modules will be loaded at startup. The last one will be exported.
- `Object` : A multi-item bundle is created.
The key is the name of the file being chunked, and the value can be stringed or arranged.

Explore different entry types

The following code is for creating a string:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
entry: './src/myfolder/file.js'
};
```

The code above is the code in which the webpack performs the build to the `file.js` under the src/myfolder folder when it is executed.

The following code can also be written as follows:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
entry: {
main: './src/myfolder/file.js'
}
};

```

The following code is when Array is used:

```js
module.exports = {
entry: {
main: ['./src/myfolder/file_01.js', './src/myfolder/file_02.js']
}
};

```

Forwarding the array creates a multi-main entry.
It can be useful when you want to collect multiple dependency files into a single chunk and generate their dependency graphs, but this is a good choice when you quickly set up an application or tool with one entry point (such as a library), but it is less scalable.

What should be included in the Entry file?

The file specified in the `entry` property must contain the overall structure and content of the web application. Because the webpack understands and analyzes the associations of modules used in the web application with the file, it must contain content that can run the application.

For example, if you are building a blog service as a webpack, the code might look like the following:

```js
// index.js
import LoginView from './loginView.js';
import UI from './ui.js';
import Posting from './posting.js';

function initApp() {
loginView.init();
UI.init();
Posting.init();
}

initApp();
```

The code above is written assuming that the service is a single-page application (SPA). The user`s login screen, the main screen entering after login, and the screen for posting are all called in and used by the index.js file, so if you run the webpack, you will interpret the contents of the file and build the file.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99BFD54F5DD3482034)

The structure of the dependency between modules as shown above is called the Dependency Graph.

As you can see earlier, there can be one entry point, but there can be several as shown below.

```js
entry: {
login: './src/loginView.js',
main: './src/mainView.js'
}

```

This separation of entry points is not suitable for single-page applications, but for multi-page applications in which the server drops that information when entering a specific page.

### output settings

Let`s look at `output` in conjunction with `entry`.

`output` allows you to specify where to store the bundle generated by the output setting.

In other words, `output` can define where the webpack will create the bundle and by what name and how the files will be created.

If `output` is not set in the config file, the default value is ./dist/main.js. The generated bundle files will go under the ./dist directory.

The following code is `default entry point` and `output`.

```js
module.exports = {
// mode is required from webpack v4
// mode has three options: production, development, none
// mode's production automatically sets the built-in optimization option for each setting.
mode : 'development',

entry : './src/js/index.js',
output: {
// Set which path to create bundling created by filename
// __dirname is a variable that contains the path to the node file provided by node
The variables with ___ are always special variables that contain something.
// Set absolute path for path (use static as absolute value)
path: __dirname,
// Name of the bundled result file
filename: 'dist/biuld.js'
}
};
```

You must specify at least a filename and typically define path properties together as shown above.

where the filename property refers to the name of a file built with a webpack, and the path property refers to the path to that file. The `path.resolve()` code used in the path attribute is a Node.js API that combines paths that have crossed over to the factor to create a valid file path.

As you previously configured the entry points as an array above, they can also be configured as objects.

First, after creating the module1.js, module2.js file, assume the following:

```js
// module1.js
console.log('module1 실행');
```

```js
// module2.js
console.log('module2 실행');
```

Multi Entry

The following codes are `multiple entry points` and the corresponding `output` setting.

```js
module.exports = {
module.exports = {
mode : 'development', // mode (development|production) is required from webpack 4.
entry: {
jaehee : './src/js/index.js',
'module.chunk' : ['./src/js/module1.js', './src/js/module2.js'] // Use array (read from right to left)
},
output: {
path: __dirname,
filename : 'dist/[name].js' // file created mapped to the name of the entry key specified above
}
};
```

When you run `webpack`, jaehee.js, module.chunk.You can see that js is created.

Output Name Options

You can include a number of options in the filename property that you saw earlier.

Options that include the entry property in the result file name

```js
output : {
// Organize names with static absolute values
filename : '[name].js'
}
```

Options that include the module ID used internally by the Webpack in the result file name

```js
output : {
filename : '[id].bundle.js'
}
```

Option to attach unique hash values for each build

```js
output : {
// output file continues to generate changes as hash values change each time a webpack is built
filename : '[name].[hash].bundle.js'
}
```

Option to add a vivid hash value based on each module`s content in the Webpack

```js
output : {
// output files continue to generate changes as the hash value changes depending on the chunk
filename : '[chunkhash].bundle.js'
}
```

### Loader Settings

webpack mentioned that all files can be managed as modules.
However, because webpack can only read JavaScript files, css (style sheet) and images should be changed to JavaScript that webpack can read, and `Loader` will be able to change to a module that webpack can understand.

In other words, Loader is a property that allows a Webpack to convert web resources (HTML, CSS, Images, Font, etc.) rather than JavaScript files when interpreting web applications. In this regard, the loader is similar to the "tasks" of other build tools, and you can change another language, such as Typescript, to JavaScript or change the inline image to a data URL. The loader even provides a way to import CSS files directly from the JavaScript module.

In general, web packs are often used together with `babel`, which is often used to make ES2015 (ES6+) or later syntax compatible with older browsers such as IE, or to compile `react` syntax such as `jsx`.

Create the default use as follows:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
module: {
rules: []
}
}
```

Unlike entry or output attributes, the name `module` is used.

Why Loader is Required

When building an application with a webpack, let`s assume that there is a code as below.

```js
// app.js
import './common.css';

console.log('css loaded');
```

```css
/* common.css */
p {
color: blue;
}
```

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
entry: './app.js',
output: {
filename: 'bundle.js'
}
}
```

If you build the above file with a web pack, you will get the error as below.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99CF75455DD3487B34)

Applying the CSS Loader

Here`s a quick look at how to load a css file using the loader.

Lets you install the required loader as follows:

```bash
$ npm i -D css-loader style-loader
```

After installing the loaders, try creating and creating files as follows:

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Webpack Task</title>
</head>
<body>
<header>
hLearn to Webpack</h1>
</header>
<div>
<p>
In fact, webpack setup is notoriously complex, but it has the advantages of being able to handle a wide variety of tasks.
It continues to improve quickly and easily (?
</p>
</div>
<script src="dist/jaehee.js"></script>
<script src="dist/module.chunk.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

If you want to check out the previous bundling, module.chunk.js import is optional.

Import the CSS file from the index.js file as if it were importing a JS file. Make sure to import it from the js file as shown below.

```js
// index.js
import '../css/base.css'

console.log ('Run Webpack Bundling');
```

After creating the src/css/base.css file, simply create the css as shown below.

```css
@charset "UTF-8";
body {
color: red;
}
```

Add to existing `webpack.config.js` as follows:

```js
module.exports = {
mode : 'development', // mode (development|production) is required from webpack 4.
entry: {
jaehee : './src/js/index.js',
'module.chunk' : ['./src/js/module1.js', './src/js/module2.js'] // 배열 사용
},
output: {
path : __dirname,
filename : 'dist/[name].js' // file created mapped to the name of the entry key specified above
},
// Define a module for specifying loaders
module: {
rules: [ //module.rules allow specifying multiple loaders.
{
// test : specify file to convert
// found ending with string .css extension as regular expression.
test: /\.css$/,
//use : Name of the loader to be applied to the file
// On the loader, the module loading sequence loads from right to left of the elements in the array and proceeds.
use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader']
}
]
}
};
```

After configuring as above, run `webpack` in CLI and check index.html in browser to see that the font color has changed to red.

module.rules settings

Let`s take a look at the module in `webpack.config.js`.

Multiple loaders can be specified using `module.rules` to help keep the code simple and tidy by displaying the loader.

Inside `module.rule`, `test` specifies the file to be converted, and `use` sets the loader to be assigned to the file to be converted.

As explained in the `use` comment, the loader is evaluated and executed from right to left, and in the example code above, it is carried out through the css-loader to style-loader.

To analyze it again globally, all css files with the .css extension are bundled into JavaScript files through the css-loader and put in the html as an internal style as a style-loader.

So if you check index.html in the source view of the browser developer tool, you can see that it contains the internal style as shown below.

![image](https://webclub.tistory.com/images/index.dev.jpg)

# Frequently used loader types

In addition to the CSS loader we discussed earlier, the following types of loader are frequently used when creating real services:

- Babel Loader
- Sass Loader
- File Loader
- Vue Loader
- TS Loader

# When using multiple loaders

If you are using multiple loaders, you can add the loader option to the `rules` array as shown below.

```css
module.exports = {
module: {
rules: [
{ test: /\.css$/, use: 'css-loader' },
{ test: /\.vue$/, use: 'vue-loader' },
// ...
]
}
}
```

The method used above by bundling the css may not be a common practice.

It is common to use individual css files `import` rather than creating them in an internal style.

In that case, instead of bundling the css into jaehee.js as above, it should be separated into a separate `.css` file and imported at the time of build, which is available as `plugins`. We`ll learn about `Plugins` below.

### Plugin Settings

Plugins are properties that provide additional functionality to the basic behavior of a Webpack.
This is at the heart of the webpack and can do things that the loader cannot do.
Compared to the loader, the loader is involved in the process of interpreting and converting files, while the plug-in is responsible for changing the shape of the output.

The difference is that Loader handles modules, while Plugin handles bundled files.

Plugin can obfuscate, compress, or perform additional tasks such as hot-loading, copying files, extracting files, and using aliases.

That is, plug-ins are used to use file-specific customizations.

The plug-in method is available with factors and options, and must pass a new instance to the `plugins` property.

And depending on how you use the webpack, there can be many different ways to use the plug-in.

By default, the plug-in declares:

```js
// webpack.config.js
var webpack = require('webpack');
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
mode : '',
entry : {},
output : {},
module : {},
plugins : [
new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
new webpack.ProgressPlugin(),
new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin()
// ...
]
}
```

As shown above, only object instances created by the constructor function can be added to an array of plug-ins.

The above two plug-ins each play the following roles:

- HtmlWebpackPlugin : Plug-in that creates HTML files as a result of building a webpack
- ProgressPlugin : Plug-in that shows the build progress of a webpack

To separate compiled CSSs into separate CSS files

If you injected css (internal style) into the DOM using a loader from the previous example code, try modifying the example code to extract the css file.

You must first install the plug-in to extract the css file.

```bash
$ npm i --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin
```

When the installation is complete, modify the existing webpack.config.js and index.html as shown below.

```js
// webpack.config.js
const path = request ('path'); // set path
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require('mini-css-extract-plugin'); // node_modules 에서 불러옴

module.exports = {
mode : 'development',
entry: {
jaehee : './src/js/index.js'
},
output: {
path : path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
filename : '[name].js'
},
module: {
rules: [
{
test: /\.css$/,
// MiniCssExtractPlugin 사용
use: [
MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
'css-loader'
],
// folders or files to exclude exclue
// Specify not to compile using other modules (safe)
exclude: /node_modules/
}
]
},
// Plug-in Settings
plugins : [
// Compile + Specify the path and name where the bundled CSS file will be stored
new MiniCssExtractPlugin({ filename: 'css/style.css' })
]
};
```

Although `_dirname` has been used in `path` of `output` until now, we will use `path` which is provided by nodeJS from now on.

The path module was recalled from the top to `require(`path`)`, the output was routed to `path.resolve(__dirname(`dist`)`, the test was used to specify the file to load, and set to the left by `MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, `css-loader``.

You can also define folders to exclude as `exlude: /node_modules/`, which is defined as a secure dimension to avoid compilation to other moders, modules other than MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader, css-loader.

Conversely, you can use this loader to specify what to compile with `include`.

Finally, create `new MiniCssExtractPlugin ({filename: `css/style.css` })` for plug-in setup to extract css files. This option lets you specify the bundled file name as the path where the compilation and the bundled final file will be stored.

When you are done creating webpack.config.js, run `webpack` from the CLI to see that the /list/css/style.css file is extracted.

Also, `import` is required to use css extracted from index.html.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ko">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Webpack Task</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/style.css">

It continues to improve quickly and easily (?
</p>
</div>
<script src="dist/jaehee.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

If you check index.html in your browser, you can see that css has been applied.

### Concepts Review

The diagram illustrates the four main attributes of the Webpack we`ve seen so far:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99A0144C5DD348AB38)

The following is a summary of what we`ve learned so far by looking at the diagram above.

- The `Entry` property is the destination file to run the Webpack. Entry Point
- The `Output` property is a property that enters information about the output of a Webpack, usually defining a filename and path.
- The Loader property adds non-Javascript files such as CSS and images to the webpack for recognition. Loaders are applied from right to left.
- The `Plugin` property is a property used to add additional functionality to a file converted to a Webpack. It has control over the entire process of converting a Webpack.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned about `mode`, `entry`, `output`, `module`, and `plugins`, which are major properties of web packs.

The next chapter will cover the key environment settings that are actually required in practice, and the resulting webpack Dev Server, SASS, other loaders, plug-ins, and more.
