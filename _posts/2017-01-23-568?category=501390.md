Search strings using indexOf, lastIndexOf

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/257D554658AFA93F37)

### Searching for a String Substring

If you want to find out if there is a specific substring within the target string, you can use the embedded method indexOf of the String object to locate the substring.

```js
var testValue = 'This is the Cookbook';
var subValue = 'Cookbook';

var iValue = testValue.indexOf(subValue);
console.log(iValue);

// The indexOf method of a String object returns a number indicating where the first letter of the index or partial string is located, and the first letter in the string is used.
// The character has an index of 0.

// To determine whether a partial string is in the target string, you can look at whether the value returned is -1 or not.
if (iValue != -1) {
console.log('Try to find' substring');
}

// indexOf method has two factors.
// The first factor is the substring you want to find, and the second factor is the index value of where you want to start the search.
// The second factor can be omitted.
var str = 'Have you had a dinner?';
var subStr = 'dinner';
var iVal = str.indexOf(subStr, 8);
console.log(iVal); // 15 => Returns index 15 of a partial string

// indexOf method navigates from left to right. However, sometimes you want to navigate from right to left in strings.
// In this case, you can use the lastIndexOf, another method of the String object.
// lastIndexOf returns the index location of the last partial string that appeared.

var testStr = 'I have been there';
var findStr = 'been';
var findIndex = testStr.lastIndexOf(findStr);
console.log(findIndex); // 7

// The second argument in lastIndexOf can be omitted as in indexOf, and the search start position is passed.
// The location where you want to start the scan is a right-hand count.
console.log(testStr.lastIndexOf('have', 5)); // 2
console.log(testStr.lastIndexOf ('there', 7); // -1 return, not found
// Search from right at index location with 7 and not found
// i.e. search right-to-left from position b of 'I have b' at the location of index 7, so there is no string you want to find and return -1'
```

### To extract a partial string from a string

Suppose you have a string of multiple sentences, one of which contains a list.

The list starts with a colon (:) and ends with a period (.).

When extracting these strings, use the indexOf method to locate the colon.

Again, use the indexOf method to locate the period that follows the colon.

The two locations can then be used with the substring method to extract the string.

```js
var sentence = 'A list of item: cherries, oranges, apples, bananas.';
var start = sensation.indexOf(':'); // locate the colon.
var end = sentence.indexOf ('.', start+1); // locate the period, and define the index to be found after the index location where the colon is located as a factor.
console.log(start, end); // 14, 50

// If the start and end positions of the list are obtained, then the first and second factors of the substring method are:
// Index value indicating the starting and ending positions of the strings to be extracted, respectively.
var list = sentence.substring(start+1, end);
console.log(list); // ' cherries, oranges, apples, bananas' 를 반환

// You can also use methods such as String.split to separate each value in the list.
var fruits = list.split(',');
console.log(fruits);
// The comma(,) is returned as a separator with an array of [" cherries", "oranges", "apples", "bananas"].

console.log ('test box group'.split('')); // return empty string as separator'
```

### To determine if a string exists or is an empty string

If you want to determine if a variable is defined and contains a string or is empty, you can write:

```js
If a variable exists and the string has a length greater than or equal to zero, it is true
var unknownVal = '';
if ( (typeof unknownVal != 'undefined')
```

Use the typeof operator, valueOf method, and length properties of a String object to create a condition statement that determines whether a variable is defined and contains a string or is empty.

(valueOf method is a method shared by all JavaScript objects.)

length lets you know the length of the string and determine whether the string variable is an empty string or not (if empty, length = 0).

However, if no variables are defined when handling a string, an error named undefined occurs.

So if you`re not sure if a variable is defined, you can`t test the string length.

Therefore, before testing the length of the string, it is necessary to involve a test process on whether a variable exists.

These properties help prevent errors in accessing properties of undefined variables.

Another consideration is to be prepared if the defined variable is not a string.

For example, if a variable is a number, then the condition statement is false because the number does not have a length property.

But what if the value of the variable is a String object?

If the type of variable is not known exactly, you must explicitly test whether the variable`s data type is `string` before testing the string length.

If the test is successful, you can obtain a string greater than 0 in length as expected.

However, if the variable is a String object rather than a String literal, the typeof operator will return `object` instead of `string`.

That`s why another JavaScript method, valueOf, should be used together.

The valueOf method is available on all JavaScript objects and returns the raw data type whatever the object is.

Returns each raw data type for Number, String, and Boolean, and returns the contents of the function for Function.

If the variable is already string literal, the valueOf method temporarily wraps it into a String wrapper object and executes the valueOf method.

In this case, the value returned is string literal.

Therefore, the above condition statement is to verify that the variable is defined, and if so, use the valueOf method to determine if the string is a String object or string literal, and the string is greater than zero.

Typically, to determine whether a variable is an empty string or not, only the string length is tested and whether the variable is defined.
