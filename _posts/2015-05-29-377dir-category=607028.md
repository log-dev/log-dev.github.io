If you need to run multiple sites in each domain while using XAMPP, you can freely use them locally as virtual hosts and virtual domains.

### XAMPP Virtual Hosting Settings

Open and modify the installation drive:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf file.

`##NameVirtualHost *:80` is modified as follows.

```undefined
NameVirtualHost *:80

```

The following is then added at the end of the same file:

```undefined
<VirtualHost *:80>
DocumentRoot "/xampp/htdocs"
ServerName localhost
</VirtualHost>

```

This will allow you to access the existing xampp settings page by typing localhost in your web browser, even if you set up a virtual host in the future.

A new virtual host can then be added to the end of the same file.

```undefined
<VirtualHost *:80>
DocumentRoot "/xampp/htdocs/blog/www/"
ServerName blog
ErrorLog "logs/blog.uzuro.com-error.log"
CustomLog "logs/blog.uzuro.com-access.log" common

<Directory "/xampp/htdocs/blog/www/">
Options Indexes Includes execCGI
AllowOverride All
Require all granted
</Directory>
</VirtualHost>

```

In practice, the path and folder /xampp/htdocs/blog/www should be created.

SeverName may use the IP address as shown below.

```undefined
ServerName 127.0.0.2

```

### XAMPP Domain Connection

In fact, connecting a domain requires setting up a host to the company that purchased the domain. Here, we approach the fake domain by modifying the hosts file because it will be written locally for work.

Run Notepad as administrator and open the file C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts. Set up a temporary domain as desired.

```undefined
# XAMPP ServerNames
127.0.0.1 server
127.0.0.1 blog
127.0.0.1 uzuro
127.0.0.1 labs

```
