The /tmp directory is also used by site visitors for uploading when operating the website. When using the /tmp directory without partitioning it, sometimes malicious code from users can cause difficulties. To avoid this in the first place, we recommend partitioning the /tmp directory during OS installation.

Occasionally, when installing packages or working with /tmp directories, you may encounter errors when applying them as follows.

### /tmp directory security settings

First, back up the existing /tmp directory.

```bash
sudo cp -Rp /tmp /tmp-backup

```

Add nodev,nosuid,noexec to the /tmp partition.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/fstab

UUID=.... /tmp ext4 defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 2

```

Re-mount the /tmp directory.

```bash
sudo mount -o remount /tmp

```

Restore the /tmp directory that was backed up.

```bash
sudo cp -Rp /tmp-backup/* /tmp/

```

Delete unnecessary backup files.

```bash
sudo rm -rf /tmp-backup

```

The /var/tmp directory used by some programs is also dangerous, so you can use the /tmp directory by placing a symbolic link to the /tmp directory as shown below.

/var/tmp Delete

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/

```

Symbolic Link Hang

```bash
sudo ln -s /tmp/ /var/tmp

```

Reboot

```bash
sudo reboot

```
