### Abstract Class Concepts

Abstract

> It is the extraction of characteristics common among entities.
For example, birds, insects, and fish are extracted from common characteristics such as animals and approached in a semantic manner.
Samsung, Hyundai, LG => Company (abstract)

Abstract Class

> A class that defines the common fields and methods of physical classes.
An abstract class can act as a parent class of a physical class.
Abstract classes cannot create objects alone; they are used only as parent classes.

### Purpose of Abstract Class

The purpose of unifying the names of common fields and methods in a physical class.

> If you have multiple people designing a physical class.
Each physical class can have a different name for each field and method.

Save time when creating a physical class

> The entity class only needs to declare additional fields and methods.

When you want to create a specification for a physical class design.

> Pre-defined the fields and methods that the entity class should have in the abstract class, and the entity class must inherit and create the abstract class unconditionally.
