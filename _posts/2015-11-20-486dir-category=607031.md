Using CSS to resize objects such as <img> and <video> elements while maintaining their proportions is a very challenging part. If the space where the objects will be printed is a fixed size rather than a fluid size, it will make you even more distressed. Explore the corresponding CSS3 attributes.

### object-fit properties

The "object-fit" property specifies how the content of the replaced element (such as <img>, <video>, <object> and <svg>) is mounted to a specified width and height.

This can be useful if you take over an object of different sizes, such as a profile image or various cases of printing a fixed size thumbnail, and rework it to a certain size while maintaining the ratio. It is very similar to `background-size` properties of CSS3.

To examine the changes in attribute values, images are used below and an example page is prepared separately.

```css
img {
width: 100px;
height: 100px;
object-fit: cover; /* property values to be covered below */
Border: 1px solid #000 /* Additional */ to determine the size of the element
}

```

- fill : The content of the element being replaced is scaled up, down, stretched, or shrunk, depending on the specified width and height. The aspect ratio is not maintained as the element changes to a size that can be filled. This is usually the same as forcing an image to be width and height.
- contain: Scale up as much as possible within the width and height defined in the element while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- cover: The content expands until it fills the defined width and height while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- none: The content size is adjusted by the underlying algorithm, regardless of the size of the element. The algorithm is centered on the size of the original.
- scale-down : change the size of the content as if nothing is specified or `contain` is specified. This shows the result of being smaller than the original size.

Starting with version 4.4, Android supports iOS starting with version 8.4.

> Cross-browsing is difficult because the latest version of IE, Edge, is not supported yet. There is a recommended polyfill for CSS object-fit property, but the bug does not seem to be resolved.

### object-position 속성

The `object-fit` property seen above basically moves the image to the center of the element. Changing this position to the desired value is the `object-position` property.

- The default values are 50% and 50%.
- Numeric px, em, and % are used, and keywords top, left, right, and bottom can be used.
