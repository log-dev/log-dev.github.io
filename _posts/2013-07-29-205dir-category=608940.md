If SSH was installed during Ubuntu 12.04, you can set it up immediately.

If not, install as follows.

```bash
sudo apt-get install ssh-server

```

(For server purposes, no clients are needed. )

### SSH Settings

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Port Settings
Port 22

# Ignore automatic login file
IgnoreRhosts yes

# root login prohibited
PermitRootLogin no

# Only the sudo group can log in (delete this part to enable other users to ssh login)
AllowGroups sudo

```

### SFTP Settings

Using an SSH server, FTP (SFTP) using SSH is also available. If an individual uses a server alone, SFTP can be used with an existing account without any setup, and SFTP can be set up under chroot to use with other users.

Connection

```bash
'sftp UserID@Hostname

```

- get : download
- mget : Download multiple files
- put : upload
- mput : upload multiple files
- ls : Output a list of files in the connected SFTP
- !ls : Outputs a list of files on the local server
- !{command} : running on local server

I don`t know how to set it up exactly yet. The following content is not a successful configuration. Just keep that in mind.

1. Create a dedicated group for SFTP users

```bash
sudo groupadd sftpusers

```

2. Add SFTP User

Specify the login group for user tiffiny as sftpusers and specify non shell loginable nologin

```bash
sudo useradd -G sftpusers -s /sbin/nologin tiffiny

```

3. Enter Password

```bash
sudo passwd tiffiny

```

In Ubuntu 12.04, the setting of /etc/default/useradd is all annotated except SHELL. Therefore, adding cognitive users does not create home directories and other files. It`s good not to have unnecessary files created, but this has caused me to shovel them again for a while.

4. Create a user home directory

```bash
sudo mkdir /home/tiffiny

```

5. Set ownership and permissions

First, set ownership of files that will be created below the tiffiny directory as shown above

```bash
sudo chown -R tiffiny.sftpusers /home/tiffiny

```

Each user`s home directory itself must be root for both the owner and the owning group.

```bash
sudo chown root.root /home/tiffiny

```

6. SSH Settings

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Subsystem sftp internal-sftp
Match group sftpusers
ChrootDirectory /home/%u
ForceCommand internal-sftp

```

I tried to follow the settings above, but I can`t... Why?

Link other methods of setup. > Centos SFTP Settings

### Login using RSA key

Access using rsa keys is better for security than login methods using regular passwords. And it`s convenient to set it up once.

First, let`s check if the settings for using the rsa key in the ssh server settings are correct.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

PubkeyAuthentication yes
RSAAuthentication yes

```

Two types of authorized_keys and authorized_keys2 appeared and were googled, and in the past, authorized_keys2 was found under OpenSSH 3.0. The OpenSSH side currently requires all keys to be written to authorized_keys, and authorized_keys2 is just an alternative to past methods, which may not be supported at any time.

For security reasons, it is better to generate private keys on the client side and send only public keys to the server side.
