This issue occurs in vsftpd 2.3.5 of Ubuntu 12.04.

When chroot is applied, such as `chroot_local_user=YES` in the setup file /etc/vsftpd.conf, it occurs when the user`s ftp directory is granted write permission. Of course, FTP users should be able to upload files, but it seems to have occurred in the process of preventing security loopholes.

You can disable and use the chroot function if you want to use it alone, but you must enable the chroot function if you want to use it with other users.

Alternatives include how to modify the current installation version while maintaining it, downloading and installing new packages, and downloading modified versions using PPA.

### Keep version

Several methods have been proposed to maintain and modify the current installation version.

https://www.benscobie.com/fixing-500-oops-vsftpd-refusing-to-run-with-writable-root-inside-chroot/#comment-2051

you can choose one of 3 ways:

1. Define option local_root= in configuration file. must by /home or other path to directory with users folders. In this way vsftpd chrooting to /home directory.

Specify local_root=/home to prevent other users from leaving /home. However, this approach will show all other users` home directories that will exist below the /home directory. I can use the permission to make it invisible somehow, but I don`t like complicated things.

2. Define option passwd_chroot_enable=yes in configuration file and change in /etc/passwd file user home directory from «/home/user» to «/home/./user» (w/o quotes). In this way vsftpd chrooting to /home directory.

This method modifies the user`s home directory by adding the user`s home directory portion to /etc/passwd, such as /home/./user, which also lists all directories below the /home directory, such as method 1.

3. Download sources of vsftpd-ext, compile and overwrite exist vsftpd binaries or take it from repositories and add to configuration file option allow_writable_root=yes.

Install vsftpd-ext and insert allow_writable_root=yes in the setup file to resolve it.

The above methods are not recommended by me.

Rather, we recommend removing installed versions and downloading new packages or using ppa.

### How to use PPA

Ubuntu 12.04 Version

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:thefrontiegroup/vsftpd

```

```bash
sudo vi /etc/vsftpd.conf

chroot_local_user=YES
allow_writeable_chroot=YES

```

```bash
sudo restart vsftpd

```

Ubuntu 12.10 Version

Download and install from http://www.kunniagaming.net/vsftpd-chroot-patched-12.10/

Installation and adding `allow_writeable_chroot=YES` such as 12.04

Install version 3.0 of vsftpd.
