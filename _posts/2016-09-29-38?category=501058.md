Object Vs Object()

Before you learn about the difference between Object and Objcet(), read the following first:

Object() generates and returns an instance, such as new Object().

Thus, the method, shape, and instance return of specifying the new object() and parameters are all the same.

It does not use the new operator.

So what`s the difference between an object and an object()?

Let`s look at the code below.

The difference between the two is the presence or absence of calls. This means that we create and assign built-in objects (already created objects) and new objects.

Where the built-in object is assigned, there will be prototype: Object, and the output result of the called obj2 will be __proto_:Object.

This is because creating an instance with Object() creates an instance with a property connected to Object.prototype, which is the criterion for creating an instance.

If you still don`t understand, read the post about the prototype again.
