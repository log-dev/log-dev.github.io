Try installing Ubuntu 12.04.02 (LTS) Server version. The Long Time Support (LTS) version is a five-year, long-term support version.

### Download

When downloading Ubuntu, you can receive it directly from the Ubuntu website http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server, but since it is a British server, download time is longer.

By default, it is downloaded for 64bit, so you must click on the drop-down menu to download it for 32bit. Download it by pressing the Get Ubuntu 12.04 LTS button.

Domestic users often use http://ftp.daum.net/. Linux and related packages are supported by FTP on Daum.

Downloading using the link below is fast in terms of speed. If you are using a torrent, it is better to download the torrent version.
