When creating a web application, if you don`t need to store a member`s avatar or profile in the DB (most of you want to collect personal information...), there are applications that can bring in the information of the person in advance and save you the trouble. In foreign web applications, you can often check what is produced by linking them.

### Introducing Gravatar

Gravatar - Globally Recognized Avatar is an application that registers a user`s profile and avatar based on an email address and invokes them as needed to reduce the effort required to write them for each application. More than 8 billion avatar images are serviced daily by Grabata, and are used by popular applications and sites such as WordPress, github, DISQUS, stackoverflow, etc., and are provided free of charge.

If you have seen the icons below in the comment or profile column, you have already used an application with Grabata.

Grabata provides a URL for the use of registered avatars and profiles, which can be invoked wherever HTML can be written.

Site managers and developers are:

- With a little effort, you can easily add a gravata.
- There is no need to prepare additional plug-ins to manage avatars.
- If users who comment on the site use Grabata, they do not need to manage their accounts and images.

User is:

- There is no need to register profiles or avatars on every site you visit.
- Modification of the image of the gravata only reflects it on all applications and sites using the gravata associated with it.
- It is possible to connect multiple mail accounts to Grabata and set the avatar shown in each mail account differently.

### Gravatar URL

If you registered your avatar and simply created a profile after signing up on the Grabata website, you can generate the URL needed to request image and profile data and call it.

> Grabata's API is based on simple HTTP GET requests that do not require authentication. Refer to the development source document for various options and code usage that are not described below.

All the URLs in Gravata are based on the Hash1 value of the email address. Both the image and the profile are accessed as email hash values, which are the default method for identifying identity within the system. To ensure consistent and accurate hashes, the following steps should be used to generate hashes.

Below, we are using PHP`s `md5(), but if you search on the web, there are hash generators such as the md5 hash generator, so if you don`t want to approach it programmatically, let`s use it.

- Remove spaces before and after email addresses.
- Force all characters to be lowercase.
- The final string is the md5 hash value.

For example, "MyEmailAddress@example.com" requires removing the space before executing "md5()", because the hash value after entering a space is different from the hash value after the email address. Below is a verification method using PHP, and JavaScript does not provide md5() by default, so you need to use a plug-in separately.

```php
'echo md5 (MyEmailAddress@example.com); // Example of blank space "f9879d71855b5ff21e4963273a886bfc"

$email = trim( "MyEmailAddress@example.com " ); // 공백 제거 "MyEmailAddress@example.com"
$email = strtolower( $email ); // 소문자로 "myemailaddress@example.com"
echo md5( $email ); // 해시생성 "0bc83cb571cd1c50ba6f3e8a78ef1346"

```

When combined into a single line, it becomes the following code.

```php
echo md5( strtolower( trim( "MyEmailAddress@example.com " ) ) );

```

Let`s practice the image request below using the generated hash values.

### Request Gravatar Image

Grabata images can be requested like normal images using the tag `<img`. To obtain images of a particular user, an email hash must be calculated (described above).

The most basic image request URL is as follows.

```undefined
http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/HASH

```

You can paste the hash value obtained through `md5()` in the HASH part above (for example, the hash value of the email address of the author). You can type this in the browser address bar.

```undefined
http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84

```

The final deliverables using img tags are as follows.

```html
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84" />

```

![image](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84)

If a file extension is required, the URL address should be `.You can add `jpg`.

```html
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84.jpg" />

```

By default, the size of the image is 80px by 80px. Grabata can be requested by specifying `s=` or `size=` parameters and one pixel size.

```undefined
http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84?s=200

```

![image](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84)

While the size of the image can be any value between 1px and 2048px, many users use low-resolution images, and requesting a larger size can result in pixel/low-quality images.

What will happen if the Grabata image and the email address are not matched? The basic image shown is as follows.

![image](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf82)

If you want to provide your own basic image (logo, funny face, etc.), you can provide `d=` or `default=` parameters and URLs. The URL must encode the URL in order to be sent correctly (to test the hash value without 0000000000).

```html
<img style="vertical-align: bottom" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0000000000000000?d=http%3A%2F%2Ficon.daumcdn.net%2Fw%2Ficon%2F1312%2F19%2F152729032.png" />

```

I set the next logo as the basic image.

You can find encoding sites such as URL Decoder/Encoder on the web, so you can use them.

In PHP, the URL-encode string can be used as shown below.

```php
echo urlencode( 'http://example.com/images/avatar.jpg' );

```

If there is no related image when including the underlying image, Gravata automatically provides the image. The default image URL has several conditions.

- It should be publicly available (i.e., not the development environment behind the local server or firewall). The base image must pass a secure scan to prevent malicious content.
- It should be accessible via HTTP or HTTPS on standard ports 80 and 443.
- It should have recognizable image extensions (jpg, jpeg, gif, png).
- Query string cannot be included (if included, it will be ignored).

In addition to specifying one`s own image, Gravata has built-in options that can be used as default. Most of the tasks used to generate requested email hashes and theme images are unique email addresses. These options allow the following keywords to be used as values for the parameter `d=` when a single image is requested.

```html
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84?d=mm" />

```

- 404 : If nothing is associated with an email hash, no images are imported, and instead HTTP 404 (File Not Found) is returned.
- mm (mystery man): a simple human-style outline
- identicon: Geometric pattern with email hash (varies with each email hash value)
- Monstersid: Monsters of different colors, faces, etc.
- wavatar: Create faces with different features and backgrounds
- retro : Create an arcade-style pixelated face shape of 8 bits
- blank : transparent PNG image

For special reasons, if a basic image is always wanted to be shown, set `f=` or `forcedefault=` parameters and values to `y`.

```html
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84?f=y" />

```

![image](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84?f=y)

Gravata allows users to rate their images to see if they are suitable for a particular target. It is displayed as an image of G-rated unless it is specified to be seen as a higher class by default. Using the parameter `r=` or `rating=`, the class can be specified using the following values:

- g : Suitable ratings for display on all websites
- Pg: Rated for rude gestures, dressed provocatively, or mild violence.
- r : Ratings that may include such things as abusive language, violent violence, excessive exposure, or bad drug use.
- x : Ratings that can include hardcore sex images or highly disturbing (?) violence

The images below are examples of G or PG grades.

```html
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84?r=pg" />

```

The parameters described above can be combined to be used. For example, the URL below is a gravata class G or PG of 200px * 200px, and sets the 404 response to be seen if the email hashes do not match.

```html
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84?s=200
```

If a page provided via SSL (HTTPS) displays Grabata, it can be serviced over SSL. On the other hand, most browsers have annoying security alerts. To provide Grabata over SSL, you can start the URL as shown below.

```undefined
https://secure.gravatar.com/...

```

### Profile Request

Users can optionally link various profile information to their Grabata accounts. This information is an open connection similar to the process of image request.

Use simple profile links as shown below.

```undefined
http://www.gravatar.com/HASH

```

HASH is the user`s email hash. This request is automatically redirected to the URL of the user`s username-based (each language is supported), as shown below (if you look closely at the address, the `/avatar/` part is missing).

```undefined
http://www.gravatar.com/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84 --> http://en.gravatar.com/beau

```

Test Link to Link: Mimic Profile

Important to note, profile requests can only resolve the hash of the primary address in the account. Because a user can have multiple addresses in one account, the result of a Gravata image request might not be a profile request for the same hash. (An important point to note is that profile requests will only resolve for the hash of the primary address on an account. Users may have multiple addresses on a single account, so while a Gravatar image request may return a result, a profile request for the same hash may not.)

Profile data can request different data formats to access in a simple programming manner. It supports the following formats.

- JSON
- XML
- PHP
- VCF/vCard

QR codes can be inserted to help move to the profile page. The default value for QR codes is 80px * 80px.

` on the main profile page.You can add qr`.

```undefined
http://www.gravatar.com/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84.qr

```

This can be used to create links or to display them in image format as shown below.

```html
<img src="http://www.gravatar.com/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84.qr" />

```

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

As requested by image, QR code size can be set with `s=` or `size=` parameters and one pixel value.

```undefined
http://www.gravatar.com/04b828795157ecfab4594b7765d9cf84.qr?s=200

```
