Spriting with Compass

Sprite techniques are easier to use with Compass.

Place sprite images in PSD to help you automatically place sprite images and create style sheets without having to work on them.

We`ll learn how to use sprites in Class using some of the following methods:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/216ADA40566E570232)

### Setup

We will explain on the premise that your folder has four PNG images to be used as sprites.

The image folder is configured as follows:

> images/one/ball.png
images/one/bus.png
images/one/check.png
images/one/coupon.png
images/one/new.png

When you configure a folder, you should organize the images you want to use as sprites into one folder.

For example, because each image in the one folder is created as an image (sprite image) through Compass, you need to configure another folder (e.g. two/icon-01.png, two/icon-02.png) if you need another sprite.

### Basic Usage

If the png you want to use as your sprite is contained within one folder, you can simply create a sprite image in Class.

Write to the Sass file as follows:

If your configuration file is requesting a library about Compass, you do not need to import @import "class/utilities/sprites";

Conversely, if you want to import only the sprite compas library and use it, you can write it as above.

The @import "one/*.png" alone will create a sprite image.

The sprite mix-in is then called to create a sprite style sheet as shown below.

When you invoke the mix-in using the folder name containing the individual sprite images as shown above, CSS Output is output as shown below.

Please consider that the above style sheet was created based on my locality.

One-s6aa6b138ae in the images folder, as the code suggests.The sprite image called png is automatically generated.

A CSS class is created with the folder name + each sprite image name to configure the style sheet.

> For your information, the sprite image name that was created will be updated with the new sprite image name when you check the class clean and watch again.
And even if you add individual sprite images, the existing sprite images will be removed and recreated.

### Selector Control (CSS selector control)

As you can see above, Class provides another mix-in to control the CSS selector because it can be inconvenient for users because it even controls and generates the CSS class name.

The name of the mix-in above depends on the folder name you placed the sprite image in, and @param is the individual sprite image name you want to use.

### Sass Functions

The sprite mix we`ve identified so far has a problem with not providing the dimension, width, height value for that sprite.

However, it offers magical demension functions called map-sprite-width, map-sprite-height.

> As you may have noticed, <map> is similar to an object in JavaScript.
You can think of it as a list and control each png list when you run the Class Sprite mix.

### Customization Options

The user options for sprites can control the behavior of the stylesheet, as well as configuration options that allow you to change (create, control) the default values for sprites maps or individual images.

> · Please refer to $sprite-selectors - magic sprite selectors.
· $disable-magic-sprite-selectors - Controls the use of magic sprite selectors. true disables magic selectors. Default : false
· $default-sprite-separator - controls the separators between names when controlling sprites on style sheets

magic selector

To use special selectors, you add _hover, _active, and _target to the file names within the sprite directory.

For example, if you have an image named menu_01.png and have an active image for it, configure the image file name as menu_01_hover.png, menu_01_active.png.

Just by setting the image name, the sprite of the compass performs a magical action.

> my-buttons/glossy.png
my-buttons/glossy_hover.png
my-buttons/glossy_active.png
my-buttons/glossy_target.png

If you add the following Sass code in the directory structure as above:

Your style sheet will be compiled as follows:

When you view the compiled CSS, you can use :over, <.map>_hover, and <.map-hover for your selection.

In addition, if you use `$disable-magic-sprite-selectors` on global and regional scopes, you will not run these magic selectors.

Other options

> · $<map>-<sprite>-spacing
· $<map>-<sprite>-repeat
· $<map>-<sprite>-position

The above options help you control the aperture, repetition, and location of sprite images when they are created.

### Controlling layout control

Compass supports several layout approaches to sprite image creation.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/23381541566E57FE17)

The sprite layout provides four layouts, and you can define the spacing and alignment when you combine images.

And one of the things to be careful about is that you can`t control spacing when setting layout to smart. (It seems to mean that there is no need to control the spacing because the layout is set smartly.)

The next posting will cover the advanced use of sprite maps.

As I saw briefly in the code that sets up the layout above, it supports the advanced usage of help functions called sprite-map.
