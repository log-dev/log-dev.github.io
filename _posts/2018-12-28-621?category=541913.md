CSS3 animation gently switches the CSS styles that apply to the elements to other CSS styles.

Animation consists of a CSS style representing animation and keyframes representing the intermediate state of animation.

Animation is much larger, more complex, and has a variety of abilities than transitions, so it can achieve more precise effects.

## Animation Advantages

CSS animation has advantages over JavaScript animations for three reasons:

- You can easily create animations even if you don`t know JavaScript.
- Animation using JavaScript may not perform well even though it is well made. CSS animation is rendered as smoothly as possible using multiple technologies such as frame-skipping.
- The browser can efficiently optimize the performance of animation. For example, animations about elements that are not currently visible can minimize the load by reducing the update cycle.

Animation

The `animation` property can be written in a single property and shorthand, similar to `transition`.

Animation consists of `@keyframes`, which can define the intermediate state of an animation with the property `animation-*`, as mentioned above.

First, let`s take a quick look at a single attribute in `animation`.

- animation-name : Defines the name for specifying the middle state of the animation. The intermediate state is described using the rule `@keyframes`.
- animation-duration : Specifies how long an animation of a cycle will take place.
- animation-delay : Specifies when the animation starts after the element is loaded.
- animation-direction : Specifies whether the animation will end and resume from the beginning or reverse.
- animation-iteration-count : Specifies how many times the animation repeats. It can be designated as `infinite` and repeated indefinitely.
- animation-play-state : You can stop or restart animation.
- animation-timing-function : Specifies at what time interval the transition of intermediate states will take.
- animation-fill-mode : Specifies what values are applied before or after the animation starts.

Syntax

```css
'/* Single attribute */
.object {
animation-name: 1s;
animation-duration: 2s;
animation-delay: 1s;
animation-direction: alternate;
animation-iteration-count: 3;
animation-play-state: paused;
animation-timing-function: 1s;
animation-fill-mode: both;
}

/* Shorthand */
animation: name | duration | timing-function | delay | iteration-count | direction | fill-mode | play-state> [,...];
```

### animation-name

The name is the name of the animation set in the property `@keyframes`. You must set a name before you can play the animation.

That is, you must define a name before you can play (call) an animation.

Valid animation name and invalid animation name

Valid Name

```css
'animation-name: name; /* name starting with string */
animation-name: _name; /* Name starting with the underbar (_) */
animation-name: -name; /* name starting with hyphen (-) */
```

Invalid Name

```css
'animation-name: 1name; /* name starting with a number */
animation-name: @name; /* Name starting with special characters */'
```

If an animation name is written as `none`, it does not play animation.
Even though there is a property called `@keyframes` called `none`, it does not play animation.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="499" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/ggxmee?height=499&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=ggxmee&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=-webkit-animation-name%20%EC%98%88%EC%A0%9C&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="-webkit-animation-name 예제" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_ggxmee"></iframe>

### animation-duration

`animation-duration` can set the time it takes to play an animation once and is similar to `transition-duration`.

animation-duration 예제

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="573" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/ggxgLP?height=573&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=ggxgLP&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=-webkit-animation-duration%20%EC%86%8D%EC%84%B1%EC%9D%84%20%EC%A0%81%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%9C%20%EC%98%88%EC%A0%9C&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="-webkit-animation-duration 속성을 적용한 예제" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_ggxgLP"></iframe>

The `animation-duration` property value has been set to zero, so clicking on the rectangle does not play animation.

And even if the value is set to negative (-2s), the animation does not play.

Setting the value of the animation-duration property to 2s plays an animation in which the rectangle moves from left to right of the screen for two seconds.

### animation-delay

The property `animation-delay` sets the time to delay the start of an animation and can use the following values:

- 0 : Starts the animation as soon as the attribute is applied (default).
- now : Start animation as soon as properties are applied. It is the same as set to zero. It is available starting with iOS 2.0.
- Numbers and units: Start animation after the set time.
The units available are seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). The time is calculated from the moment the value is applied to the positive plane property, which delays animation playback.
The animation runs as soon as the value is applied to the negative sleep property, but the animation is played from the scene after the specified time.
For example, if the value is `-1s`, the animation is played from the scene after one second.

animation-delay 예제

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="385" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/mRwjvW?height=385&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=mRwjvW&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=-webkit-animation-delay&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="-webkit-animation-delay" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_mRwjvW"></iframe>

If you set the property value to zero, the code will run immediately to play an animation in which the rectangle moves from left to right on the screen, and now the animation will also play immediately.

For example, when the property value is set to 2s, clicking on the rectangle plays the animation after 2 seconds.

An example of setting the property value of `animation-delay` to negative -1s plays an animation in which the rectangle moves from the center of the screen to the right. Because the value is set to negative, the animation is played from the scene in the middle of the screen after a second.

### animation-direction

`animation-direction` is a property that defines the direction of animation playback.

It is forward to play from the style set in from the @keyframes property to the style set in to, and reverse to play from the style set in to to.

`animation-direction` has the following values:

- normal : plays the animation in a forward direction (default). After one replay, restart the first frame.
- Alternate: Start animation in a forward direction and play animation in reverse and forward directions. It plays in a forward direction when playing an odd number of times, and reverse when playing an even number of times.
- reverse: Play the animation in reverse direction. Once the replay is over, it starts again from the frame.
- Alternate-reverse: Start animation in reverse direction and play animation alternately in both forward and reverse directions. It is played in reverse direction for the odd number of times, and in a forward direction for the even number of times.

animation-direction 예제

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="390" width="100%" name="cp_embed_4" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/apwPRp?height=390&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=apwPRp&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=-webkit-animation-direction&amp;name=cp_embed_4" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="-webkit-animation-direction" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_apwPRp"></iframe>

When you run the first box (click a rectangle), three animations are played in which the rectangle moves from left to right on the screen.

Because the `animation-direction` property value is set to normal, the rectangle moves from left to right of the screen again after one replay.

The value of the `alternate` property starts to play the animation in a forward direction, alternating reverse and forward direction.

So, when you click on the second rectangle, it moves from left to right on the screen where the rectangle is forward, and when the animation plays for the second time, it moves from right to left where the rectangle is reversed. On the third replay, move back forward from left to right.

Because `animation-direction` property value is set to `reverse` in the third box, the square moves from the right side of the screen to the left after one replay. When you run the example and click a rectangle, the animation will play three times, with the rectangle moving from right to left on the screen.

The value of the `alternate-reverse` property in the fourth box starts animation playback in reverse direction and changes direction to reverse direction to play animation.

This means that the box initially moves from the right to the left of the screen in reverse direction. When the animation is played for the second time, the rectangle moves from left to right in the forward direction, and when it is played for the third time, it moves from right to left in the reverse direction.

### animation-iteration-count

`animation-teration-count` is a property that defines the number of times an animation is played.

The animation-teration-count value is as follows:

- Numeric : The default is 1, which plays the animation as many times as you set.
If the number is decimal, return to the first frame and stop while playing the animation; if the number is negative, the animation is not played.
- infinity : Repeat animation indefinitely.

animation-iteration-count 예제

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="346" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/ygogQq?height=346&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=ygogQq&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=-webkit-animation-iteration-count%20%EC%98%88%EC%A0%9C&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="-webkit-animation-iteration-count 예제" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_ygogQq"></iframe>

The first box sets the `animation-iteration-count` property value to 2, so the animation is played only twice.

The second box sets the property value to 1.3, which is a decimal, and the animation is played once and then played up to the frame corresponding to 3/10 of the entire frame, ending the animation.

Setting to `infinite` causes the animation to operate indefinitely.

### animation-play-state

`animation-play-state` is a property that defines whether an animation is played or not.

The property values for `animation-play-state` are as follows:

- running : plays animation (default).
- Paused: Stop animation.

animation-play-state 예제

The `animation-play-state` property is applied to the stop button and play button respectively as JavaScript.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="377" width="100%" name="cp_embed_6" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/YNxZvr?height=377&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=YNxZvr&amp;default-tab=js%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=-webkit-animation-play-state%20%EC%98%88%EC%A0%9C&amp;name=cp_embed_6" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="-webkit-animation-play-state 예제" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_YNxZvr"></iframe>

When you click the Stop button, apply animation-play-state:paused to stop the animation. When you click the play button, apply animation-play-state:running; to play the animation.

### animation-timing-function

Sets the step-by-step playback speed during playback with properties that control the playback speed between the animation`s keyframes.

For example, the property "animation-timing-function:ease-in-out;" gradually speeds up playback at the beginning and slows down playback at the end.

Similar to `transition-timing-function`.

ease VS ease-in-out

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_7" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/mRMmeG?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=mRMmeG&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=ease%20%EC%99%80%20ease-in-out%20%EC%9D%98%20%EB%B9%84%EA%B5%90&amp;name=cp_embed_7" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="ease 와 ease-in-out 의 비교" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_mRMmeG"></iframe>

### @keyframe and animation shorthand

The animation is played by defining the style of each frame to play the animation, starting with the style set in the from attribute or 0% attribute and gradually changing to the style set in the to attribute or 100% attribute.

Syntax

```css
@keyframes animationName {
from {
css-styles;
}
to {
css-styles;
}
}
```

The keyframe defines the `animation-name` of the element to which the animation applies and creates the percentage of time per frame to play in the block of the keyframe code.

- 0% : The starting frame of the animation.
- 100% : This is the last frame of the animation.
- from : is the starting frame of an animation. equal to 0%.
- to : The last frame of the animation. It`s 100% the same as.

You can create frames by setting multiple intermediate values (%) between 0% and 100%.

```css
@keyframes move {
0% {
top: 0px;
}
25%{
top: 20px;
}
75%{
top: 175px;
}
100%{
top: 200px;
}
}
```
