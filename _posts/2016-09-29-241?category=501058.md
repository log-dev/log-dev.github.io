constructor property

The constructor instance has properties that point to its own constructor function.

When you create an object as an instance, this object/instance automatically adds a property called constructor, which points to the constructor function that created it.

Next, let`s see if you can use the constructor property on a custom object.

These codes are easy to find when the constructor function that created the instance is unknown (especially when it is someone else`s code) when dealing with an instance.

This allows you to see which instances are arrays, objects, or other data types.

The following code creates most objects as instances and uses the constructor property to determine the constructor function corresponding to the literal/raw value:

As shown above, the constructor property can correctly find the constructor function of the literal/raw value.

The constructor property also works well with the constructor function of the user-defined constructor.

The following code defines a user-defined constructor function, then uses the new keyword to create a new object, which accesses the constructor property of the object:

### instanceof operator

You can use the instanceof operator to determine whether an object is an instance of a particular constructor function.

The return value is true or false.

Let`s check the following code to see if it works well not only with custom objects but also with native objects.

> One of the caveats when dealing with instanceof operators is that all objects in JavaScript inherit the Object() constructor, so if you write a code to determine which object is an instance of Object(), you always return true.
It always returns false if you use the instanceof operator to determine if it is an instance of an object wrapper corresponding to a raw value.
e.g) 'foo' instanceof String
The above 'foo' returns false if it is a String constructor function with the raw value.
If the string 'foo' was created using the new operator, such as new String ('foo') the instanceof operator would return true.
Therefore, you must use instanceof only for composite objects (array, object literal, etc.) or instances created by constructor functions that return objects.
