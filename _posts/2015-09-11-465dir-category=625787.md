If you are interested in WordPress, sometimes you are worried about ambiguous Korean translations and plug-ins that are not Koreanized. I search the relevant data and summarize the things I learned.

### Understanding WordPress Translation Systems

WordPress has a multilingual support system using language files. This can be divided into basic WordPress language files and plug-in language files, which can be modified to the desired wording by translating and replacing them.

The translation of WordPress is completed only with the individual`s contribution-contribution, and the status of the contribution work can be checked in Translating WordPress. WordPress` translation uses an open-source engine called GlotPress, which is described in GlotPress (translate.wordpress.org).

The above translations are included in the official version of WordPress and are reflected through inspection. It is impossible to translate and officially reflect according to individual likes and dislikes, so it is necessary to modify the already distributed files directly.

If there is a translation part you want to modify, you need to find a language file containing that translation part.

Language file location: wp-content/languages

The basic translation files are located in the above directory, but not necessarily, but there are also separate translation files in each directory, such as a theme or plug-in, with names such as language or lang. Korean translation files have the same format as ko_KR.po or ko_KR.mo, and the language directory contains the following files by default.

- ko_KR.po, ko_KR.mo: Translation of common wordpress files exists here.
- admin-ko_KR.po, admin-ko_KR.mo: Translation of the admin panel exists here.
- admin-network-ko_KR.po, admin-network-ko_KR.mo: Translation of network management exists here.
- contents-cities-ko_KR.po, contents-cities-ko_KR.mo: Translation of continents and cities exists here.
- plugin/plugin name-ko_KR.po, plugin/plugin name-ko_KR.mo: A translation file for the plugin exists and may not exist in the plugin directory. Plugins do not create language files in the plugins directory of this language directory, but rather place them in the language directory or in the language directory of the wp-content/plugins/plugins/plugins directory.
- Theme/theme name-ko_KR.po,theme/theme name-ko_KR.mo: Theme/theme name-ko_KR.mo: Theme`s translation file exists here.

Language files have the same extension as *.po, *.pot, and *.mo. In many cases, only files with *.po or *.mo extensions exist, each of which has the following uses:

- Portable Object Template (POT): This file imports all messages that exist in the file. If you look into the wordpress file, there are often `__(`random string`) and `_e(`random string`)`, which are the POT files that have been searched for and found in English messages.
- PO (Portable Object) : All messages retrieved from the POT file are translated into a file that can be modified to the desired wording.
- MO (Machine Object) : Compiles the PO file into a binary file to generate the MO file. This file is called up from WordPress.

The principle of language file generation is based on wordpress` source code, where specific instructions are used to write phrases to print. In the syntax below, the part "Site Name" was written as such.

```php
echo '<label for="blogname">' . __('Site Name:') . '</label>';

```

A format such as `__(`to be printed`) is used and collected from a POT file and translated into a PO file and an MO file.

The codes written to enable translation are referred to as Internationalization in WordPress, and Localization is referred to as Localization when the translated language. Plug-ins registered with WordPress must be created to prepare for this internationalization by default.

In order for the translated file to work properly, you must also pay attention to the file name. In some cases, such as plug-ins and themes, there are characters that represent their names.

```php
load_plugin_textdomain( 'akismet' );

```

Because of its unique name, the language files have the same file name as akismet-ko_KR.po, and the subsequent ko_KR is related to the site language. WordPress loads and shows language files, such as site languages.

### WordPress Translation Notice

Wordpress is easy to update, while managing translation files due to updates is challenging. The easiest way to modify PO files using Poedit is to make them into MO files, but since these files can be changed at the time of updating, it is necessary to back up and the hassle of having to re-modify the replaced translation files is inevitable.

We are looking for plug-ins in relation to them and will see if changes are maintained as the update progresses.

Afterwards, we will learn about how to use Poedit and plug-ins related to translation.
