Let`s take a look at how to extract the thumbnail of the next TV pod video and point out what to keep in mind. In this article, we used JavaScript, which is easier to access if you use a server script.

### Extract the following TV Pod Video VID

Suppose the following TV pot video was inserted somewhere as shown below. Most multimedia services require extraction of this VID value to distinguish images with their own ID values (VIDs) and to classify each information.

```html
[IFRAME Title=] [Teaser] The beautiful anna-tainers..." height=360 src="http://videofarm.daum.net/controller/video/viewer/Video.html?vid=va3b6l4NCNvXozvXloCCoZo
```

Among the inserted video source codes (iframes), the following TV pod videos are filtered out in regular expressions based on the special string they have.

```js
var vurl = $('iframe').attr('src').match(/videofarm.daum.net\/controller\/video\/viewer\/Video.html\?vid=([0-9a-zA-Z]+)/i);

```

The selected VID is extracted by cutting the string from the TV pod video.

```js
var vidStr = vurl.indexOf("vid=");
var vid = vurl.slice(vidStr+4);

```

### Thumbnail Address

Originally, the ajax request address should be completed as follows and requested.

```js
var ajaxUrl = 'http://tvpot.daum.net/clip/ClipInfoXml.do?vid='+vid;

```

The problem is that the next TV pot is not an open API, so the request for ajax will be subject to cross-domain restrictions. However, the thumbnail of the next TV pot has a certain address system, so you can infer it.

```js
vsrc = 'https://i1.daumcdn.net/svc/image/U03/tvpot_thumb/'+vid+'/thumb.png';
$('.thumbnail').append('<img src="'+vsrc+'">');

```
