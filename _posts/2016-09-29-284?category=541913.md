CSS3 2D transform(전환)

Transform is a powerful feature added to CSS3.

In the last few years, if you`ve discovered some remarkable new attempts at CSS on the web, there`s a high probability that there`s a transformation at the bottom.

Deformation means to change the shape of a particular element in many ways, to put it simply.

The true potential of the transition is fully represented when used with CSS transition or with 3D functions.

But first, you need to understand the most basic form of transformation, the 2D transition.

Now we`re going to learn about 2D transitions.

The 2D transition alone allows you to adjust the position, size, direction, perspective, etc. of the elements as intended, all of which are possible with a single line of CSS.

### transform properties

The attribute `transform` accommodates many functions, but under 2D conditions, four functions are mainly:

- translate()
- skewX(), skewY()
- rotate()
- scale()

Except for the lotate() function, each function accepts two parameters.

That is, one value per dimension comes.

In a 2D environment, dimension is each value corresponding to the horizontal x-axis and vertical y-took. This will be covered again when dealing with the translate() function.

### Translate

What does `translate()` do?

Although the word name is translate, it has nothing to do with semantic meaning, and this function moves the element from its original position on the x- and y-axis to somewhere else on the page.

For example, when you reposition the vertical and horizontal positions, you can do this separately, or combine them as a function.

Refer to the following code:

```css
div {
-ms-transform: translate(50px,100px); /* IE 9 */
-webkit-transform: translate(50px,100px); /* Safari */
transform: translate(50px,100px);
}

#demo-01 {
width: 300px;
height: 300px;
background: blue;
transform: translateX(100px) translate(50px);
}

#demo-02 {
width: 300px;
height: 300px;
background: red;
transform: translate(10px, 80px);
}
```

If there is only one parameter written in `#demo-02`, the y-axis receives a value of zero and the given value is applied as the value of the x-axis.

So how is this property different from the basic `position` attribute, top, left, right, and bottom?

The position property moves the element relative to the container. In contrast, translate() always takes a new position relative to the original (self) position of the element.

In addition, elements with `position: absolute;` become completely separate from other elements in the layout and have no effect on the sibling elements.

However, as long as the translate() function is physically present in the field of view, it retains the space that the element originally occupied.

The following illustration shows that although the box 8 was moved, the space (red board space) that was originally occupied (even if that space was not used) is maintained.

These moved elements become independent of other elements in the layout.

Because `position` attribute values and `translate()` differ in this way, you can make various necessary choices depending on the situation.

For layout solutions, position: absolute; is more appropriate and translate() may be more convenient for trigger events such as hover and active.

However, this is a general rule and we will have to decide based on our situation.

Paul Irish, a chrome developer and front-end development leader, mentions animation using two methods: position attribute values and translate().

### Skew (slope)

The function `skew()` has limited categories to utilize, so it has not received much attention among the various transition functions.

Maybe it`s because we didn`t think creatively enough. However, this function certainly has its purpose and can produce impressive effects when making animations.

Even if you are currently implementing a skew() function rather than a `skewX()` or `skewY()` function, it is supported to maintain compatibility with the content produced long ago, but skew() function itself has virtually disappeared.

Instead, you should use the functions skewX() and skewY() to specify the x and y slopes separately. This is because the x and y values may be combined together within the skew() function to produce completely different results.

So what does the skew transition actually do?

Simply put, it basically rotates an element around its axis, causing it to tilt.

```css
.skewX {
-ms-transform: skewX(20deg); /* IE 9 */
-webkit-transform: skewX(20deg); /* Safari */
transform: skewX(20deg);
}

.skewY {
-ms-transform: skewY(20deg); /* IE 9 */
-webkit-transform: skewY(20deg); /* Safari */
transform: skewY(20deg);
}
```

### Rotate

The `rotate()` function is also very powerful and has been used numerous times in the past through images and JavaScript, so there`s no doubt about its importance.

As with the skew() transition, the rotate() function also behaves as an angle-based value. However, other 2D transition types are applied horizontally and vertically on the x-axis and y-axis, but rotations are related to the z-axis in 2D environments.

```css
#demo-01 {
-ms-transform: rotate(-90deg); /* IE 9 */
-webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg); /* Safari */
transform:rotate (-90deg); /* counterclockwise */
}

#demo-02 {
-ms-transform: rotate(90deg); /* IE 9 */
-webkit-transform: rotate(90deg); /* Safari */
transform: rotate (90deg); /* clockwise */
}
```

### Scale

The `scale()` function doubles the size of an element to a certain number, allowing it to be resized.

For example, when the value of scaleX() is 2, elements with original width 200px will change to 400px wide.

```css
div {
-ms-transform: scale(2,3); /* IE 9 */
-webkit-transform: scale(2,3); /* Safari */
transform: scale(2,3);
}
.demo {
transform: scaleX(2) scaleY(3);
}
```

If you use the scale() function with one parameter, you do not consider one value omitted, but apply zero to the omitted variable, but instead apply one specified value to both x and y.

```css
div {
transform: scale(2);
/* One parameter applies to both the x-axis and y-axis */
}
```

As you can imagine, if the scale() value is 1, it retains the original dimension of the element. Values greater than that increase the size and values less than that decrease the size.

The scale() function can also use the width, height property, as compared to the position property value of the scale() function can also use the width, height property.

So what`s better than using width and height?

There may be many good things, but one of them is the case of hover.

For example, suppose six boxes of layouts are arranged in two rows and three columns. If you use the width and height property to make the box 1.5 times larger in width and height when the box is in the hover state, the alignment may go wrong with one box in the hover state. (Of course, if you use another method, you can make sure it doesn`t go wrong.) be aware of a typical situation as a assumption)

However, if you use scale() function, you can see that there is more utilization because it does not affect other factors like the translate() function.

In other words, using the wide and high properties to increase the size of the box affects the career path of other boxes, but the scale() function creates the same effect as the other peripheral boxes remain in order and only the larger boxes pop out toward you.

If this technique is used to make the reduced image larger when hover is in the image thumbnail gallery, then the scale value of the first thumbnail image can be reduced to a smaller scale after making the hover image larger from the beginning, considering the pixelation phenomenon (image breaking).

```css
.gallery img {
transform: scale(0.6);
}

.gallery img:hover {
transform: scale(1);
}
```

This will not cause the image to break as long as it remains at or below its initial size.

### transform-origin 속성

If you`ve looked at what we`ve described so far, you`ve probably confirmed that the functions above operate at the center of the element.

For example, a scale-applied element grows in size from its center, and a lotate-applied element rotates around the center point of the element.

However, the `transform-origin` property is a property that allows you to specify a point other than the center by specifying the datum where the transition occurs with the x and y parameters.

```css
div {
-ms-transform: rotate(45deg); /* IE 9 */
-ms-transform-origin: 20% 40%; /* IE 9 */
-webkit-transform: rotate(45deg); /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
-webkit-transform-origin: 20% 40%; /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
transform: rotate(45deg);
transform-origin: 20% 40%;
}
```

CSS Sytax

> transform-origin: x-axis y-axis z-axis | initial | inherit;

- x축 : left, center, right, length, %
- y축 : top, center, bottom, length, %
- z-axis : specifies where length, view is placed on the z-axis (if used with 3D transformation).
- initial : Follow the default values for this property.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

### Combine transformation

You can combine the different transition functions mentioned earlier to make wider use of the effects.
