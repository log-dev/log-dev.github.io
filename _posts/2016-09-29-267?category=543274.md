Structural Elements of HTML5 #1

Learn about `nav` and `aside` in HTML5 elements.

Then take a look at `figuration` and its child element `figcaption` and compare it to `aside`.

### nav, aside, figure 소개

- <nav>: Go to another page (usually called `site navigation`) Or a section that contains a list of navigation links for moving from the same page to a section (often referred to as a `content content list` used in long articles). This is a major navigation area, not just a meaningless group containing links. And you`re probably using a "skip navigation" link.
- <aside> : A section of a page that organizes content that is separate from the surrounding content but has very little relevance. A printed copy refers to a sidebar, excerpts from a piece of writing, or footnotes, and a Web blog post refers to relevant information about the piece, additional information that fills in the space, or a comment section.
- <fig> : This refers to content that can be deleted from the flow of the document even if it is moved elsewhere without any impact on the content of the document, but that is essential to understanding the meaning of the document. This element can be used to show images or videos, but it can also be used for content that contains graphics, simple code, or other media.

### <nav> element

You may already be using `<ul class="nav">" or something similar for site navigation.

The `<nav>` element can explicitly mark up navigation links, which can provide accessibility benefits.

For example, users of a secondary device, such as a screen reader, may skip the navigation section and go directly to the content, or skip the intermediate content and jump directly to the navigation item.

We can use this element in another way to determine which is the main navigation area.

And will it help blind users by facilitating navigation access through shortcuts? While navigation links within a site or page are certainly essential, interesting content in the footer section of a page is not necessarily.

When cataloging navigation links, it should be noted that the element `ul` or `ol` is still needed.

It must be, and it is the most appropriate factor. You can also include a title or related content.

The following code introduces the `<nav>` used in conjunction with the title element.

```undefined
<nav>
<h2 class="a11y"> Main navigation </h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/"> Home </a></li>
<li><a href="/"> Weblog </a></li>
<li><a href="/"> About </a></li>
<li><a href="/"> Contact </a></li>
</ul>
</nav>
```

### <aside> element

While `aside` content is an added element, it is not essential to understand the main content.

In other words, print design is an inspiration, but not essential, as it is just relevant content.

For example, footnotes provide additional information but are not essential. And while excerpts are essential content, they are copy phrases cited in the main content.

However, keep in mind that `aside` should be relevant. It is recommended that the sidebar of the site be placed in the `aside` as a child element of `body`.

However, information throughout the site should not be shown in "aside" as a child of "article."

And as long as the `aside` element is relevant to the parent segmentation element, it can be suitable for advertising.

```undefined
<aside class="sidenote">
<p>
The <em>segmenting root</em> elements include <blockquote>, <body>, <details>, <fieldset>, <figure> and <td>.
</p>
</asde>

> <header> and <footer> apply only to the segmenting element or 'segmenting root' element that you are currently in.</p>
```

### <figure> element

The `figure` element is essential, but the deployment is not.

You can use the position of the CSS to fit any part of the deployed section.

Usually referred to from text as the following code, but not necessarily:

```undefined
This is an example of the use of "hgroup" for subheading <p>.</p>

<figure>
<img src="img/hgroup-subtitle.png" width="500" height="136" alt="hgroup Use Case: Subject of article used with alternate title" />
</figure>
```

You can also use `figcaptions` to provide `figures` with additional captions as the first or last child element.

```undefined
<figure>
<figcaption>...Title of the article used with the alternate title </figcaption>

<img src="img/hgroup-subtitle.png" width="500" height="136" alt="hgroup Use Case: Subject of article used with alternate title" />
</figure>
```

Finally, `<figure>` can contain one or more content elements:

```undefined
<figure>
<pre>
<ruby><strong>crapulent</strong><rp>(</rp><rt>krǽpjulənt</rt>
<rp>)</rp></ruby>
</pre>

<img src="img/crapulent.png" width="570" height="80" alt="Ruby text used to pronounce words in English dictionaries" />

The ruby text used in the dictionary definition of "figcaption" represents the pronunciation symbol that follows the basic word.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

Ask yourself if the content is essential to understanding the content in the section and choose `aside` or `figure`.

If content is not essential, but only relevant, use `aside`, if it is essential but its location is not important, so it can be transferred to an appendix, use `figure`. Of course, if the location is related to the previous and following, you should find and use something else that is more appropriate.

It is also important to note that `nav` and `aside` are the elements of the segmentation content, so their titles affect the formation of document overviews.

The child title element is hidden in the document outline because `figure` is a segmentation root element.

In sum, almost without exception, `section` and `article` will definitely have a title element.

The title element can be included in the header along with other information in the introduction.

### Other Considerations

As an experience-based way of choosing between £section and £div, refer to the following comments introduced in HTML5 Doctor:

The sectioning element can also contain one or more footers, along with additional information such as the author (address) and copy line (small), or associated links.

Importantly, <header> and <footer> should be aware that these elements only apply to the segmenting elements that each belong to.

In addition, <headet> and <footer> cannot contain another <header> and <footer>.

Finally, although we have preconceptions about the meaning of all these words such as "header", "footer", and "aside", we need to know that their actual semantic meaning stems from the type of content they contain, not from presentations or arrangements that represent relationships.

For example, <aside> may contain footnotes, and <footer>, which contains a "Top of Page" link, is above the section.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<title> Article (HTML5) </title>
</head>
<body>
£header id="branding"> <!-- Header of page. -->
<h1>Site Name</h1>
<!-- May contain other content. -->
</header>

<nav>
<ul><li>Main Navigation</li></ul>
</nav>

£divid="content" >!--It's wrapped to give CSS. Not a section because there is no title. -->
<article>
<header>
<h1>Article title</h1>
<p>Article metadata</p>
</header>
<p>Article Content</p>
<footer>Article footer</footer>
</article>
Second content on page <aside id="sidebar"!--not relevant to the Article above -->
<h3>Sidebar title</h3>
<p>Sidebar content</p>
</aside>
</div>

<footer id="footer">Footer</footer><!-- 페이지 풋터. -->
</body>
</html>
```

The markup above is an example of an ideal page structure.

We used a standardized layout that includes the page header, site navigation, main column, side column, and page putter.

Notable here, sidebar contains content that is not relevant to Article.

Therefore, it is a child element of the body, not the <article>.

If "aside" contains content that is very slightly relevant to Article, we can make "aside" a child of "article."

Also, the headers and footers on the page do not contain overlapping <header> and <footer>. In this case, you will need to use the <section> element instead.

Keep in mind that <header> and <footer> do not include any other <header> and <footer> elements.
