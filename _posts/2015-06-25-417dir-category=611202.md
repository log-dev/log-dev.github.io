I suddenly found a window icon on the taskbar today. I clicked on what it was, and it was a notification window for Windows free upgrade reservations. I`ll search for the information you`d like to know and list the information you`ve collected.

### When will Windows 10 be released?

On July 29, 2015, it is a software designed for both desktop and laptop computers, tablets and smartphones (with a separate line of products called Windows 10 Mobile).

> Integrated software is good, but we don't want to force desktop users to do things that are convenient for touch devices like Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. To increase the accessibility of touch devices, we force desktop users who will take up the majority of the time to avoid being criticized.

### Is this a free upgrade?

There`s a long line of explanations about this, and to put it simply,

- The upgrade itself is free of charge for both illegal copies and genuine products.
- Support targets are Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 users.
- Free online upgrades require updates to Windows 7SP1 and Windows 8.1 S14.
- Windows 7 RTM, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 RTM require installation disks or ISO media.
- Upgrading illegal copies will also ensure that Windows 10 works properly and will be provided with continuous security updates. However, since it is still illegal windows, the fate will depend on the changing policy.
- After the free upgrade period (one year after launch), it must be purchased for a fee, and the retail price is as follows.
Windows 10 Home: $119
Windows 10 Professional: $199
Upgrading from Windows 10 Home to Professional: $99
- Windows 10 Home: $119
- Windows 10 Professional: $199
- Upgrading from Windows 10 Home to Professional: $99

> It is true that the price of the Windows products is not easy. People around us often encounter illegal copies or people who use them without knowing that they are illegal copies. This upgrade is also free of charge for illegal copies, but some hesitate to say that they do not know what disadvantages they will face in the future.

You don't have to be in a hurry. If there is a one-year period and even this Windows is shunned by users, a leading company called Microsoft will be at risk. Personally, I think it's a big trend to introduce a policy that includes all users who use illegal copies and to give those who need advanced features that can be used in the future. That's probably why Linux and Android are so active as open source policies.

### What happens to the existing files if I upgrade from the existing window?

Applications, files, and settings are moved together during the upgrade process, but some applications or settings may not be moved.

- If the vaccine program is not up to date, Windows Defender will be activated.
- Some applications provided by OEMs may be removed prior to the upgrade.
- For certain third-party applications, the Windows 10 startup app checks the application compatibility, and if there are known problems, it provides a list of applications with problems. The application is removed from the system prior to the upgrade, subject to consent.

### What version will it be upgraded to?

### Windows 10 Upgrade Readiness and System Requirements

- Processor: 1GHz or higher processor or SoC
- HDD: Upgrade requires approximately 3Gb of free space; new installation requires 32 bits to approximately 16Gb; 64 bits to approximately 20Gb
- RAM: 1Gb for 32 bits and 2Gb for 64Gb
- Graphics card: DirectX 9 or higher, WDDM 1.0 driver
- Display: 1024x600

### Windows 10 Controversies

- Although illegal copies are upgraded and Windows 10 works normally, the prevailing opinion is that they will be like lanterns in front of the wind.
- Microsoft says that after the Windows 10 purchase or upgrade, the device`s support life will be free for future upgrades. There are voices of concern that it will be no different from purchasing a new window after a certain period of time, as it does not explain the exact meaning of the support life.
- Edge, a new browser released with Windows 10, does not support ActiveX. However, IE11 can also be used if necessary to be included.

> Another new browser. I am already afraid that nightmares to maintain compatibility will begin again.

### If you're curious about Window 10?

Of course, as always, there is a functional difference between the release version and the preview version, but it helps to grasp the rough flow. The Windows 10 introduction page, available from Microsoft, provides a quick overview of the features.

> I hope you can find out about the experience of many preview users through the search. Above all, the comeback of the start menu is most welcome.

### Schedule a free upgrade for Windows 10

I use Windows 8.1, which is the result of running the reservation sequentially.

- First, in the System window (right-click Start menu - select System), verify that you are on the upgrade support list (I am).
- If you`ve put off updating Windows (Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Update), you`ll be done with all the updates (I`m done with the updates and I`ll be done with them as below!)
- When you press the Schedule button, the reservation is complete and additional information can be entered. Click Send Confirmation to complete.
- It is only necessary to determine the compatibility between applications during completion and subsequent upgrades.
