HTML5

Learn what technology you need to use to make HTML5`s new semantic elements work properly across all browsers, including older versions of IE.

First, let`s look at how browsers that do not support new elements handle them.

HTML is a generous language, and for quite some time, most browsers have treated elements and attributes that are not recognized as anonymous inline elements, but have been properly handled, allowing them to be styled.

Every browser has its own supported elements listed.

For example, Firefox`s list is stored in a file called nsElementTable.cpp that tells you how to handle the elements that your browser will encounter, such as how to style them and how to handle them in DOM.

Let me give you an example for this.

The very basic page below contains the `time` element and has an internal style including a declaration pointing to this new element.

The details of the element `<time>` will be covered further, and the question raised here is, "How will the browser style this `time> element?"

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Style Unknown Elements - 1</title>
<style>
time { font-style : italic; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Make a historic journey on <time datetime="1959-05-28">May 28, 1959</time>.<p>
</body>
</html>
```

First, the good news is that most recent browsers recognize the elements properly and show the date "May 28, 1959Â£" in Italian.

However, it is different in the old version of IE. Previous versions, including IE8, do not recognize the element `<time>` properly, so the text has no style changes.

Needless to say, it`s a problem that we have to solve, and the good news is that there is a way to solve this problem.

For the benefit of IE, you can use some JavaScript to clearly declare this new element to solve the problem.

Developed by Sjoerd Visscher, this technology involves creating new DOM elements by tricking IE into properly recognizing new elements.

If you add some JavaScript as below, the style will be applied.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Style Unknown Elements - 1</title>
<script>
document.creatElement('time');
<script>
<style>
time { font-style : italic; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Make a historic journey on <time datetime="1959-05-28">May 28, 1959</time>.<p>
</body>
</html>
```

With this simple JavaScript, the IE browser is tricked into allowing it to change its style to italics and will recognize this <time> element properly.

But this is a solution that only applies to one <time> element.

The following example shows a workaround for IE to properly recognize all new elements of HTML5.

You can include all the elements you want here.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Style Unknown Elements - 1</title>
<script>
(function() {if(!/*@cc_on!@*/0)return;var e = "abbr,article,aside,
audio,canvas, datalist,details,eventsource,figure,footer,header,
hgroup,mark,menu,meter,nav,output,progress,section,time,video"
.split(','),i=e.length;while(i--){document.createElement(e[i])})()
<script>
<style>
time { font-style : italic; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Make a historic journey on <time datetime="1959-05-28">May 28, 1959</time>.<p>
</body>
</html>
```

But as you can see, it`s quite a lot of JavaScript for each page.

So what if all the new components of HTML5 are as mentioned in the catalogues?

There is a way to find new elements on every HTML5 page that is created and express some regular expressions that replace the functionality.

Shiv could be the solution. (You know a lot already.))

### html5shiv

shiv is a library that helps you support and style new HTML5 elements that are not supported in older browsers.

Named "HTML5 Enabling Script" with Remy Sharp`s permission, it is commonly referred to as "shiv".

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Style Unknown Elements - 1</title>
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="js/html5shiv.js"><script>
<![endif]-->
<style>
time { font-style : italic; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Make a historic journey on <time datetime="1959-05-28">May 28, 1959</time>.<p>
</body>
</html>
```

If you link only this script to the HTML5 page as shown in the example above and encode it, all the troublesome problems mentioned above will be solved.

Remy is also managing the script on Google, so it doesn`t matter if you link it doesn`t matter.

Just link here and you won`t have to worry about what`s in JavaScript and whether it`s the latest version or not.

And the fact that the script link is superimposed in the conditional annotation is that Script should only be called in from older versions, including IE8.

In other words, browsers that do not require html5shiv.js do not need to be called in.

It`s because they`re supporting all of the new elements on their own.

Finally, there are two key points to highlight.

- First, shiv should be linked within the element. This is because the IE browser must be aware of the new elements before the HTML5 page is rendered.
- Secondly, shiv relies on JavaScript to enable it to function properly. If most users are browsing web pages with JavaScript turned off, alternatives should be considered, such as using HTML5 element names as class names for markups.
