JS Constructor

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2370C63B5694884912)

### The JavaScript constructor creates and returns an instance of the object.

The role of the constructor function is to create multiple objects that share the same value and behavior.

By default, the constructor function is like a cookie cutter that produces objects with basic properties and property methods.

If someone else says, "Creator function is just a function!" then you say, "Yeah... If you don`t use the new keyword, it`s just a function."

> E.g.) new String('foo');

With the new keyword, the constructor function performs a special action that differs from the normal function by setting the value of this within the constructor function as a newly created object.

The constructor function with special behavior returns a newly created object (i.e., this) rather than the default false value of 1.

The new object returned by the constructor function is called an instance of the constructor function that created the object.

Let`s think about the effectiveness of the new keyword through the following generator function code.

The above code used a custom constructor function (=Drama()) to create an object called myDrama.

This is the same behavior as creating Array() objects (e.g. new Array()) through the Array() native constructor function (=built-in object generator).

A typical function returns undefined if there is no return value if it is called or executed, but the function is called using the new keyword.

Returns this is the difference from the normal function.

In other words, the object points to this, returning a new object through the new.

Most values (except raw) in JavaScript can be created or instantiated as objects using the constructor function.

This is called an instance, referring to the object returned by the constructor function.

The code above may confuse myDrama as an object and an instance, but if the instance is actually created by creating a framework for creating an object, the instance is also called an object because it is created by the creation frame of the object.

This is only to distinguish terms in a more accurate sense, but in practice, when you create a new Drama() object, the method DramaTitle is named the method of the Drama object, not the method of the instance myDrama object (=object).

What you need to know in this article is that you use the new operator to create a constructor instance, and the constructor function is basically like a cookie frame, template, which is supposed to create a preset (defined) object.
