JavaScript Association Array

The property name of a JavaScript object is called a key, the property value is called a value, and the object literal is an object as a multivalued data representation.

In this article, we will briefly summarize the terms related to the associated array used in JavaScript.

Typically, an array of data structures that allows a number to be drawn as a key.

Array is the basic data structure in most programming languages.

The keys in the array are consecutive numbers, so they can be viewed as a collection of ordered values.

Most non-numeric keys are strings, but the data structure that deals with a collection of keys and values is called an associated array using keys that are not specific to a string but of any type.

And there`s a language where associated arrangements are called maps and dictionaries, and there`s a language called hash in internal implementations.

Only the names are different, but the data structure is the same. It doesn`t matter what name you write, but this article uses the term associated array.

The primary use of associated arrays is to manipulate the key to extract values.

Other programming languages, especially script-based languages, provide associated array types as language functions.

However, in JavaScript, it is standard to use objects as associated arrays.

In other words, there are not objects for the associated array, but just looking at the object in a different way.

Therefore, in JavaScript, it is common to create objects as object literals when using objects as associated arrays.

### Similar Array Objects (=Related Arrays)

In JavaScript, objects with length properties are called array-like objects.

For example, suppose a typical object has a length property, and the main characteristic of such a similar array object is that it is possible to use JavaScript`s standard array method, even though it is an object.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

```js
var arr = ['foo'];

// Add data with push, which is an array standard method
arr.push('bar');
console.log(arr); // ['foo', 'bar'] 기록

var obj = {
name : 'jaehee',
length : 1
};

// obj is a generic object, but specifies the length property
// Add data with push, the same standard method
obj.push('pub');
console.log(obj); // Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function => error 발생
```

The error occurs because obj, a pseudo-array object with a length property specified in the code above, is not an array of course, and the array method push() method is not available.

However, if a generic object uses a prototype and the apply() method, you can make it possible to use standard methods only for objects.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

```js
var obj = {
name : 'jaehee',
length : 1
};

Array.prototype.push.apply(obj,['pub']);
console.log(obj);
```

The code above is to add a pub using the push() method for obj, a pseudo-array object.

In fact, the result shows that `pub` was added to the `1` property of the obj object and the length value increased to 2.

These pseudo-array objects are either objects or jQuery objects in the form of these pseudo-array objects.
