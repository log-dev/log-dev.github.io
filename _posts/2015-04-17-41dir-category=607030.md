### Namespace

Because XHTML is an XML-redefined language, XML can use its scalability to support document standards in other XML formats using namespace (xmlns).

```html
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

```

If you want to include elements and attributes from different document types, what about multiple name spaces with the same name? You cannot combine multiple DTDs with the same name for a single document because there is a risk of conflict. However, many name spaces are available. Because the name space allows the use of multiple markup words in the same document. Therefore, adding a new set to the elements is as easy as pointing to another namespace.

For example, if you want to include MathML within an XHTML document, you can include elements with namespace attributes as shown below.

```html
<div xmlns="www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
<!-- math elements here -->
</div>

```

An XML compliant browser will use the http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML namespace to discover that it is MathML, not XHTML.

But what if you want to include several examples of MathML? Instead of including the Namespace Declaration, it can declare MathML Namespace at the beginning of the document, and later it can be mentioned only with shortened prefixes.

```html
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en" xmlns:math="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">

```

The math located in front of the shortened namespace can then be used as a tag for the div as shown below.

```html
<math:div>
...
</div>

```

### Human Language

User agents, such as web browsers or voice browsers, can declare the language of use in HTML documents so that they can correctly interpret the language written in the web document, including human language expression and declaration using meta elements.

Human language designation means declaring human-speaking languages, such as Korean, English, and Japanese, in HTML documents so that (X) HTML-interpreted software works correctly. This can be declared on the `<html>` element, or re-declared on each specific element if various human languages are used within the content.

Korean (ko) English (en) Japanese (ja) ...

```html
<html xml:lang="ko" lang="ko">

```

```html
The apple '<p>is called <span lang="en">apple</span> in English.</p>

```

Name space and human language simultaneously in XHTML.

```html
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="ko" xml:lang="ko">

```

The method of setting up a language uses the lang attribute in HTML, the lang and xml:lang attributes in XHTML 1.0 for text/html, and the xml:lang attribute in XHTML 1.1 for text/html. Below is the lang declaration method in HTML 5.

```html
<html lang="ko">

```

Ko is Korean and ko_KR is Korean. Just as American English (en_US) and British English (en_GB), English is subdivided into several languages.

### manifest

One of the newly added properties of `<html>` in HTML5 is manifest. This property specifies the location (URL) of the document application cache list (cachemanifest). This property is responsible for importing applications from the server and running them on the client. This allows HTML documents to run while the network is abnormal, such as offline mode, and the manifest property tells the browser where to download the files needed for the application cache. Saving files to the client not only supports offline mode, but also allows faster document loading and less server load.

```html
<html manifest="cache.manifest">

```
