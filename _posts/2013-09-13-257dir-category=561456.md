Setting the file`s permission to 777 gives all account users access to the file. If a file operating as root owner was given a permission of 777, this would give the key to destroying the system.

### UMASK Value

Normally, umask has the default value of 022 but for Ubuntu, 002 is the default is the default value. For accounts associated with web servers, sometimes the ownership of web servers and permission on folders and files are required to be 777 or 666. In the case of Ubuntu, the daemons of the Apache work under the ownership of www-data, and the folders and files on the web server are owned by www-data, which is appropriate for ownership of about 775. It should also be remembered to add users of web server accounts to groups in www-data so that SFTP connections are not difficult.

To verify the umask value:

```bash
umask

0002

```

### SUID, SGID bit file

Files and programs with SUID and SGID are also security risks and should be inspected regularly.

Find SUID/SGID

```bash
sudo find / -type f \( -perm 04000 -o -perm -02000 \) -exec ls -l {} \;

```

It is recommended to delete the corresponding files that are suspicious of their existence from the retrieved results or remove the SUID/SGID to prevent them from running at the end user level.

```bash
'sudo chmoda-s file name

```

### world-writable 파일

Any user can modify and delete files that are allowed to write to all users.

```bash
sudo find / -type f \( -perm -2 -o -perm -20 \) -exec ls -lg {} \;

```

Several files, including device files, library files, and symbolic links in the /dev directory, are in world-literable format so that they are not mistaken.

### User Unauthorized Files

The user finds and removes unassigned files.

```bash
sudo find / -nouser -o -nogroup -print

```

It is rarely used in recent years, but it also scans and deletes .rhost files.

```bash
sudo find / -name .rhosts -print

```

### checking the /dev directory

Since the past, /dev directories have often been used by crackers to plant backdoors.

Check for executables

```bash
sudo find /dev -type f -exec ls -l {} \;

```

### .bash_history check

In some cases, log files and history files are removed to hide the traces of active content after crackers infiltrate and burst. If the history file is 0 in size, you may suspect penetration.

```bash
sudo find / -name .bash_history -exec ls -la {} \;

```
