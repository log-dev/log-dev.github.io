When I use a compression program, I often use Bandizip. In the past, ALzip was used because of files distributed in the form of egg on the Internet, but it is possible to replace them.

### Introduction to Bandijip

Bandizib is a high-performance, multicore-enabled compression program that supports most of the world`s most popular compressed files, such as ALZ, EGG files created by Algip programs, ZIP, 7Z created by 7-Zip programs, WinRAR-generated RARs, and TARs used by Linux.

Bandijip is free to use at home as well as in business/organizations/public institutions/educational institutions/PC rooms.

### Bandijip Features and Advantages

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2641EF4A555B165E23)

- Multi-core support enables compression up to 6 times faster than traditional programs.
- It supports a variety of compression formats, including ZIP, RAR, 7Z, ALZ, EGG files, etc.
- Enables high-speed compression for low-compression videos and compressed files.
- Excellent split compression and split decompression.
- It also supports modern OS and 64-bit operating systems such as Windows 7/8.
- We really support Unicode well.
- Native support for 64bit OS.

### Compressed files/extensions supported by Bandizib

- Compressed files that can be compressed and decompressed: Zip(z01), ZipX(zx01), TAR, TGZ, LZH, ISO, 7Z (7z).001), EXE(e01)
- 압축풀기만 가능한 압축파일 : RAR(part1.rar, r01), ACE, AES, ALZ, APK, ARJ, BH, BIN, BZ, BZ2, CAB, EGG, GZ, J2J, JAR, IMG, IPA, ISZ, LHA, LZMA, PMA, TBZ, TBZ2, TGZ, TLZ,

### Install Band-Aid

When you run the downloaded semi-detached executable, the following installation window appears: The author links only file extensions except for miscellaneous settings.

Select No if you don`t need to recommend installing other programs provided by BANDISOFT after installation.

I call these recommended programs a trap.

### Bandijip Preferences

Run Bandit > Settings > Go to Preferences

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/266CE23C555B23281E)

Go to Compression in the Explorer menu and add the desired compression format (I am a file name).add compression with zipx).

- Supports LZMA compression algorithms with high compression rates. This is typically 20 to 30% smaller file size than ZIP files, but is 5 to 10 times slower than ZIP.
- Save the file name in Unicode. Therefore, when you send a file to a foreign country, you don`t have to worry about breaking the file name.
- It supports AES256 algorithm, the most difficult encryption algorithm to break.
- Because the ZIPX format is an extension that explicitly wants to express that you are using a new compression algorithm that is not supported by the original ZIP format, it is possible for most compression programs to decompress if only the extension is replaced with ZIP.
- There is no compatibility problem due to exclusive format because the format was made and released by WinZip. Because it is an extended format in the ZIP format, many programs, such as 7zip and Aljip, support this format (not supported by WinRar).

The values set above apply to the contact menu that appears with the mouse click.

The cascade provides a concise way to organize the contact menu when opened with the right click.

### Compressing Bandits

I link this because the Bandijip site explains it in detail.

- compressing
Split Compressed File : Explanation of how to compress a file into multiple pieces in a certain amount of size. It is often used where the upload size limit per file is imposed.
Executable Compressed Files: You need a compressed program to release a compressed file, which allows you to release the compressed file without the need for a program. However, since it is created as an .exe file, it is not often used in recent years considering virus infections.
Password Compression File : Create a compressed file and make it necessary to hang the password to release it.
ZIPX Compressed Files: Bandijip can create compressed files with ZIPX files with better compression rates than traditional compression methods.
7Z Compressed Files: Bandizib provides compression to the 7Z format, the most compressed format currently in use.
