The a element not only contains the purpose of the link, but also contains various attributes and utilization methods. You can see it below.

### Element A

a element indicates anchor. Connecting two different points requires information about the two points and a connection direction. Information about two points is called anchor.

Since linked text is not just text for reading, it is necessary to show a different form than the body letter, which causes the letters applied with element a to turn blue and underlined.

- Source anchors: use the href property to refer to documents elsewhere.
- Destination Anchor: When connecting to another point within the same document, use the name or id attribute to indicate the point to be moved.

A property added to HTML5 that is used to download instead of moving to the resource being referenced.

```html
<a href="/images/myw3schoolsimage.jpg" download="w3logo">

```

The above property is used only when there is an href property.

The href property is a property for referencing documents.

- The href property is required for element a to perform hyperlink functions.
- You can refer to other types of files, such as documents, specific points, images, videos, PDF files, etc.
- The href attribute value has one of the following values: absolute path, relative path, anchor URL (`href="#top"`) and becomes the link address (URL).

The rel property specifies the relationship with the linked document.

- By informing developers, browsers, and search engines about link relationships, browsers or search engines that utilize this information can respond more accurately to user requests.
- When it is difficult to determine the type and nature of a link with only one attribute value of rel, multiple attribute values can be specified by spacing.
- rel is additional information for the href property and should be specified only when the href property exists.

A property for specifying document links to replace the current document. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. It allows us to know that the current document and its contents are the same, but in different formats, such as print documents and translation documents.

```html
<a rel="alternate" href="http://www.example.com/web_standards_print.html/">인쇄</a>

```

This is a property to specify a document link to the author of the current document. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. The author attribute value is used to provide specific information on the operation and management of documents, such as authors and contacts, in separate documents.

```html
<a rel="author" href="http://www.example.com/profile.html/">저자 소개</a>

```

A property for specifying a document link with a unique address (permalink). a, can be used in the area element. Important documents must not be addressed so that users registered as bookmarks can return them later. If the current document address is likely to change, the user should be moved to a unique address and then registered as a favorite there, which uses the bookmark attribute value.

```html
'<a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.example.com/web_standards.html/Go to the source of this document</a>

```

A property for specifying a document link in an external location. a, can be used in the area element. This property value tells you that the linked document is part of another Web site.

```html
<a rel="external" href="http://www.w3c.org/html5.html/">HTML5</a>

```

Property for specifying document links with help. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. Sometimes we link help to guide us through terminology or how to use it. For example, when a user encounters a link called a public certificate, it is hard for screen reader users to notice this link, even if they can see that it is contextually associated with help. This is because it is not known whether this link is associated with help or with a certificate download document. In this case, it is desirable to use the rel property to provide hints on whether it is helpful or not.

```html
<a rel="help" href="http://www.example.com/public_certi.html/">공인인증서</a>

```

This is a property for specifying a document link that contains copyright information (copyright) of the current document. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. Copyright information is provided in the Putter area to indicate rights to the entire document, and copyright information is needed separately when presenting sources of external content within the document.

```html
<a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses.html/">CCL</a>

```

A property that specifies a document link so that the search engine does not follow the linked document. a, can be used in the area element. To prevent the search engine from following all links within the document, specify noofollow in the meta element of the header.

```html
<meta name="robots" content="nofollow">

```

To specify individually for each particular link, specify in the a or area element.

```html
<a rel="nofollow" href="login.html/">로그인</a>

```

Search engines, such as Google, want to index (index) documents by following their own rules because they do not need to index less reliable content, free links, low-priority documents (e.g., login documents) to reduce unnecessary indexing.

The property of specifying document links so that referrers do not occur even if links are selected. a, can be used in the area element. When a user visits document B through a link in document A, the browser sends the URL information of document A to the web server where document B is located. The URL information of document A is called referrer or HTTP referrer.

```html
<a rel="noreferrer" href="http://www.reference.com/" target="_blank">참고문서</a>

```

If you specify a value for the coreferrer attribute, the browser sends a referrer even if the user selects a or area element.

A property that specifies linked documents for sidebar purposes. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. Sidebar means an area located on the side of the body of a document. Documents consisting of simple information can consist of only the body area, but if the information becomes complicated, side bars are needed, such as navigation areas and related content areas, as well as the body area.

```html
<a rel="sidebar" href="toc.html" title="Help">Create panel with table of contents for Opera help</a>

```

The author may indicate that the linked document is available as a sidebar through rel="sidebar".

The property that tags the current document. It can be used in link, a, and area elements. Tags can be viewed as keywords or topic words for searching. The search engine recognizes linked text as keywords that describe the current document at its core, not just linked text, and indexing with these texts can significantly increase task efficiency.

```html
<a rel="tag" href="http://www.example.com/allaboutdesign.html/">디자인</a>

```

When rel="tag" is specified in the linked text, the text is tagged for the current document.

Specifies the previous document. It refers to documents that are available in link, a, and area elements and that are prior to the current document in a continuous information structure. It is not yet clear what effect it will have when attribute values are specified, but if each document has information about the past or the following, it is believed that a browser or search engine can help you grasp the sequence or structure of the document as a whole.

```html
<a rel="prev" href="page1.html">첫번째 문서</a>

```

Specify the following documents: Available in link, a, and area elements, refers to documents in successive information structures that are later than current documents.

```html
<a rel="next" href="page3.html">세번째 문서</a>

```

The media property specifies the media, device, of the target document. Media properties are needed to help browsers understand to respond to a variety of devices. The types of media that can be designated are as follows, and when various media are designated, they shall be designated using commas.

If the target document is suitable for all media, specify the attribute value as all. All is the default, so unless otherwise specified, the browser determines that the target document is a suitable document for all media.

If the target document is suitable for voice output devices, specify the attribute value as aural.

If the target document is optimized for the Braille outputter, specify the attribute value as braille.

If the target document is optimized for small devices, specify the attribute value as handheld. In general, small devices have low resolution and bandwidth.

If the target document is optimized for the projector, specify the property value as projection.

If the target document is optimized for print, specify the property value as print. Unlike Web documents, printing does not apply the concept of scrolling. When a document containing a large amount of information is converted to a printout, it must be printed in a pagination manner. Since the printout has a fixed sheet of paper, the font size can be set to a fixed size, such as a point or a pica.

If the target document is optimized for the computer screen, specify the attribute value as screen.

If the target document is optimized for media using fixed-width characters such as teletype, terminal, etc., the property value is specified as tty (pixel units are not available).

If the target document is optimized for television, specify the attribute value as TV.

Media characteristics, such as output methods and layouts, are specified in the following ways, and attribute values with "device-" are used to specify a particular output medium. The remaining attribute values, except orientation, scan, and grid, can be pre-specified using "min-" and "max-" (maximum).

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2267EE38553E23A81C)

Specifies the horizontal size of the output area.

- e.g. 1) media="print and (min-width:25cm)" - when the printout area is at least 25cm
- e.g. 2) media="screen and (min-width:400px) and (max-width:700px)" - when the horizontal screen is a computer screen with 400 to 700 pixels.
- e.g. 3) media="handheld and (min-width:20em), screen and (min-width:20em)" - when the horizontal screen is a small device and computer screen with a minimum of 20em.

Specifies the height of the output area.

Specifies the horizontal screen size of the output medium.

- e.g.) media="screen and (device-width:800px)" - when the horizontal screen is a computer screen with 800 pixels.

Specifies the vertical screen size of the output medium.

Specifies the screen orientation of the output medium. The orientation of the screen is divided into vertical and horizontal directions.

- e.g.) media="all and (orientation:landscape)" - when the screen orientation is horizontal.

Specifies the percentage of the screen. The goal is to specify a ratio to represent it in horizontal and vertical sizes, so you can also enter proportional values without entering actual figures.

- e.g. 1) media="screen and (select-ratio:16/9)" - when the screen is a computer screen with a 16/9 screen ratio.
- e.g. 2) media="screen and (select-ratio: 1280:720)" - when the screen ratio is 1280:720 pixels (vertical: portrait).

Specifies the percentage of the screen in the output medium. The goal is to specify proportions for horizontal and vertical representations, so you can enter proportional values without entering actual figures.

- e.g. 1) media="screen and (device-select-ratio:16/9)" - when the screen is a computer screen with a 16/9 aspect ratio.
- e.g. 2) media="screen and (device-select-ratio:1280:720)" - when the screen ratio is 1280:720 pixels.

Specifies the color depth of the output medium. The more bits, the more colors can be expressed.

- e.g. 1) media="all and (color)" or media="all and (min-color:1)" - when applied to all color media
- e.g. 2) media="all and (min-color:3)" - media with a minimum color depth of 3 bits or more.

Specifies the color index of the output medium. A color index refers to a systematic classification of colors for use on a device, and the higher the color index, the more colors it has.

- e.g.) media="all and (min-color-index:256)" - media with at least 256 colors.

Specifies the color depth of the black-and-white device.

- e.g. 1) media="all and (monochrome)" or media="all and (monochrome:1)" - when the media is processing images in black and white
- e.g. 2) media="all and (min-monochrome:2)" - media with a minimum color depth of 2 bits or more.

Specifies the resolution of the output medium. The resolution unit uses either dpi (dot per inch) or dpcm (dot per centimeter).

- e.g.) media="all and (min-resolution:300dpi) - media with a resolution of at least 300dpi.

Specifies the injection method of the television.

- e.g. media="all and (scan:progressive)" - when the injection method is sequential

Specifies the output of the grid method. This attribute tells us whether the output device is a grid-based device or a bitmap-based device. A grid-style device specifies a property value of 1, otherwise zero.

- e.g.) media="handheld and (grid:1)" - when small device in grid format

The target property specifies where the linked document opens.

Open the linked document with a new window. The principle is to use the title property to inform the screen reader user that a new window will open.

Open the linked document in the current window (or frame). It is set to the default value.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/275BEB41553E307F0F)

Open the linked document in the parent window (or frameset). Having a parent window means having a child window, and having a frame set means having a different frame set or frame. In this situation, attribute values such as _parent or _top are required because different browsing can be deployed in different aspects. First of all, if the parent and child windows are open, specifying the link in the child window as the _parent attribute value will open the linked document in the parent window. Furthermore, when a link in a frame is specified as a _parent property value, the linked document is opened in the frame set to which it belongs.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/27149A45553E30C737)

Open the linked document in the entire area. This property value is required when there is an independent area within the document. For example, when data is called in div or frame element units, browsing proceeds in subregion units rather than in whole regions. At this time, if browsing at the entire area level is considered high-level browsing, it can be seen as low-level browsing at the partial area level. There will be times when browsing will take place at a lower level and then change to a higher level. For example, documents provided in a frame-by-frame manner usually bring up documents on a frame-by-frame basis, but in some cases they may have to be brought up into the entire area. This uses the _top attribute value.

The accesskey property specifies the access key. The computer`s primary input device is the keyboard, not the mouse. Therefore, all elements in the document must be controlled by the keyboard.

```html
< a href="http://www.google.com/" accesskey="g">Google</a>

```

- Elements with accensski properties are either focused or executed. When applied to input element, it receives focus, and when applied to element a, press the corresponding key to move to the destination immediately.
- The attribute value is specified by selecting the desired character from the alphabet or number on the keyboard.
- When defining two or more characters in a single element, they are separated by spacing.
- Windows` IE uses Alt key and Mac OS X`s Safari uses Cmd key.
- Refer to the UK Government`s shortcut key recommendation to avoid duplicate shortcut keys.

This is a newly added property to HTML5. When a user clicks on a hyperlink, the ping property sends an HTTP POST request to the specified URL. This property is useful for monitoring/tracking. The href property should be used together.

```html
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html" ping="https://www.w3schools.com/trackpings">

```

- Using the post method
- Content-type header value is "text/ping"
- String `ping` rather than requesting
- Header named Ping-Form contains the address of the current page
- The Referrer header contains the address of the current page
- The header Ping-To contains a link address
- Refer header not included when ping send destination server is same as domain of page with link
- ping The sending destination server differs from the domain of the page with the link
Ping-Form and Refer are not included if the page with the link is accessed by HTTPS
All headers are included if the page with the link is not accessed by HTTPS

When such ping requests can be received from the server side, user behavior within the site can be tracked. Previously, this feature was implemented as an HTTP redirect, which dynamically generated a hyperlink URL with a link address, and when clicked, the server recorded which link it clicked on and then redirected the page to its destination.

```html
<!-- /track.Redirect to index.html after processing in php -->
<a href="/track.php?linkTo=index.html">홈으로</a>

```

- The link URL can point directly to the destination page, making it easy for users to understand.
- The browser can tell the user that a ping is sent.
- While maintaining the hyperlink function, the ping notification function may be disabled by the user.
- Network bands can be used efficiently by browsers such as pre-reading link pages.

The title property specifies a title for the element. The title here refers to additional information about a particular element, not a name to represent the content, such as the title of the document. It has an additional, additional, and advisory nature and is primarily used to describe the characteristics or properties of a particular element, and can be used for almost any element.

When a mouse is placed over a linked text or input control, the text specified by the title attribute appears in the form of a balloon.

An auxiliary device that outputs content negatively outputs text specified by the title attribute.

Since the title property does not have the browser`s basic functionality, such as printing or copying, the principle is that information that users must process is provided through the body, not through the title property.

The title property can be used to avoid complicating the content of the text with descriptions or annotations of the elements.

It is used to provide a complete title from a list of summary titles when describing where the link is headed and what happens when a link is clicked.

```html
<a href="http://www.naver.com/" target="_blank" title="새창">naver</a>

```

Used to provide comments about paragraphs.

```html
`[Pitle=] will be revised in the next session.''

```

Use when additional explanations regarding image files are needed.

```html
`<img src="shose.jpg" alt="Children's Isometric" title="The size in the picture is the same as it is.">

```

Used when a description of the input control is required.

```html
'<input type="tel" title="Enter Numbers Only">

```

It is used to solve abbreviations or acronyms It is recommended that high-importance abbreviations be printed directly into the text without being described as a title attribute.

```html
<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>

```
