When using Git on Windows, it may be difficult to use commands directly. The GitHub made GitHub`s Git tool for Windows when it was used as a substitute, but the inconvenience did not go away from the GitHub made Git tool for Windows. I know that both GitLab and Bitbucket that use Git can be used, so I organize the contents of the connection with GitLab.

### Why GitLab?

Although GitHub is used a lot, only open projects are provided free of charge, so payment is essential to use it as a repository for private projects. I don`t know how to use Git, but why do I have to pay for it. So, we are going to test a private project at GitLab.

### Building a Git-enabled environment on Windows

- Installing msysgit: A necessary tool for using Git on Windows, a form of instruction prompt, with PATH settings and some commands installed.
- Create a local repository: Create a folder to be used as a local repository, and when you right-click on the folder, select "Git Init Here" from the contact menu created by the installation of msysgit.
- SSH-Key creation: Communication between local and remote repositories uses SSH. This requires generating a private key and a public key and registering with the GitLab service to use the public key to be used.
Right-click on the folder again (which doesn`t matter), select `Git Bash` to call up the command window.
Type `ssh-keygen` and enter
It requires several additional Enter later.
When the message The key fingerprint is confirmed, the creation is complete.
C:\Users\Your account\.You can check `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` files in ssh location.
- Right-click on the folder again (which doesn`t matter), select `Git Bash` to call up the command window.
- Type `ssh-keygen` and enter
- It requires several additional Enter later.
- When the message The key fingerprint is confirmed, the creation is complete.
- C:\Users\Your account\.You can check `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` files in ssh location.
- He is a member of GitLab, created a project, or invited as a group member of the project.
- Open and copy the created `id_rsa.pub` to the notepad and register it with the settings > SSH Keys in the GitLab account.
- Right-click the folder again to run `Git Bash` and run the command below to set up the git user and email.
GIT
`git config --global user.name "이름"
git config --global user.email "이메일"
`
- To connect to GitLab remote storage, run the command below. At this time, you have to randomly create a file and upload it to the remote storage to prevent errors. Enter `yes` to ask if connection will be established to communicate with GitLab during the process below.
GIT
`touch README
git add README
git commit -m `First commit test`
git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:account name/storage name.git
git push -u origin master
`
- If you are linking to a remote repository that already has files on it, the last sentence is `git push...``Git pull... `Change to `.
- Sign up for GitHub.
- GitHub Windows downloads, installs, and uses it to ask for GitHub`s account.
- Using Windows Explorer, drag a folder in the local repository to the folder and drag it to GitHub Windows to add the repository and complete the subsequent interworking.
