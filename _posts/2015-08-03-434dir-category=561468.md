The :checked property is a property that represents the selection status of the form field elements, checkbox or radio. It`s like imitating a click event in JavaScript, so you can use CSS only to receive the event. For example, there are cases where you change the design before and after, such as menus or tabs.

### Introducing poly-checked

It was tested in IE8 and IE7 as a polyfilm that adds a class of `:checked` pseudo-classes.

### How to use poly-checked

A version of jQuery 1.7 or later is required and inserted using IE conditional annotations.

```js
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<!--[if lte IE 8]>
<script src="path/to/poly-checked.min.js"></script>
<![endif]-->

```

All style sheet (CSS) files must be inserted before the script is inserted.

### poly-checked features

- You do not need to add classes to CSS separately (e.g. .checked).
- It works with dynamically generated checkbox/radio elements.
- It is fully compatible with JavaScript. It automatically updates the checked status of elements as if it were a real `:checked` pseudo-class.
- It maintains the specificity of the same selector as the original selector.
- Bonus: An additional patch has been made to operate `:checked` with the sibling selector. It will be useful when using customized CSS check boxes/radios.

### Known Restrictions

- It cannot be used for stylesheets in other domains. There is no CSSOM/DOM API to search for unrecognized selectors or raw CSS text in the "link rel=" element. Therefore, polyfilm uses XHR of the same-origin policy. The solution is to host all stylesheets that require polyfill in the same domain.
- Detecting dynamically added elements is done via polling1, which sometimes causes FOUC2. To avoid milliseconds of FOUC, jQuery`s `.clone(true)` can be used for already patched check boxes/radios. While it is best to remove all the polling, we do not find an event method that can detect newly generated input elements (IE=8).
- It does not polyfill dynamically added stylesheets. Although there was no need to add DOM polling because it is rare, it is possible to implement `polyCheckedParseNew Stylesheets` function.
- It does not polyfill `:checked` pseudo-class in `option` element. Optional elements are not an important priority because they are limited to cross-browsing styling. Many plug-ins that style this can be alternatives.
