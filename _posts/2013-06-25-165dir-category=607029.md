Learn how to use the mail client in the shell state of the Linux server. As with Outlook on Windows PCs, Linux shell states use a client program called mail.

### Send mail

Let`s learn the basic usage of mail commands for users of Linux servers.

Write a mail to send to the nestgoer.

```bash
mail nestgoer

# Enter a title and enter
Subject: Hello?

# Enter content
I am the manager of this system.
How's your job going?
I am currently checking the mail system.
Please reply!!

# End of mail Ctrl+D
EOT

# Cc's just enter if there's no one to share it with.
Cc: tiffiny

```

```bash
mail hahaha@daum.net

```

This is the same as sending a mail to a server user.

### Read mail and reply after reading mail

By default, mail is stored in the /var/spool/mail directory as the same file as the ID.

```bash
ls -l /var/spool/mail

Total 8
-rw-rw---- 1 nestgoer mail 1312 2013-06-25 19:11 nestgoer
-rw------- 1 root mail 2316 2013-06-03 18:06 root

```

You can check mail that arrives on your account using the mail command. The system is accessed by the nestgoer, the recipient of the mail sent above.

```bash
mail

Heirloom Mail version 12.4 7/29/08. Type ? for help.
"/var/spool/mail/nestgoer": 2 messages 1 new
1 root Tue Jun 25 19:04 21/577 "HELLO Nesgoer!"
>N 2 root Tue Jun 25 19:11 21/735 "Hello?"
```

There are two mails and a >N mark indicating the new mail.

```bash

```

You can write a reply by typing R or R while reading the mail. Or, in a mailing list state,

```bash

```

Let`s check your reply.

```bash
mail

Heirloom Mail version 12.4 7/29/08. Type ? for help.
"/var/spool/mail/root": 6 messages 2 new
1 nestgoer@uzuro.com Mon Jun 3 14:19 17/590 "*** SECURITY informati"
2 nestgoer@uzuro.com Mon Jun 3 18:05 17/590 "*** SECURITY informati"
3 nestgoer@uzuro.com Mon Jun 3 18:06 17/590 "*** SECURITY informati"

>N 5 Anyone Tue Jun 25 19:29 28/981 "Re: How are you?"

```

```bash

```

For termination, enter q.

```bash

```

### commands available in the mail command state

Type ? to show commands and help available in the mail execution state.

If you type h, only the mailing list (head) currently stored in the mbox will be printed.

Type q to exit the mail execution state.

Type n to check the next mail in the current mail.

When entered, such as !ls -l/etc, the specified shell command is executed in the mail command state.

If you type r mail number, reply to the sender and all designated recipients for the specified mail.

d If you type the mail number, the mail corresponding to the specified mail number will be deleted from the mbox.

If you type u mail number, the deleted mail will be restored to its original state. In other words, it is not deleted.

If you type smail number file name, the mail corresponding to the specified mail number will be saved in the specified file name. The save location is the home directory of the account.

If you type "m ID ID", you can specify the users who will receive the mail and send the mail.

When you type "cd directory", you change the directory location in the mail command state.

### Get specific file contents reported by mail using the mail command

I think we can apply it in relation to practice. ! ... to work with cron

echo "To Send" | Mail -s "Mail Subject" Mail address to receive

```bash
echo "System OK" | mail -s "SystemCheck" root@uzuro.com

```

If the order was terminated without any error message after executing the above order, the mail was sent successfully.

cat The name of the file you want to send | mail -s "mail subject" The email address you want to receive

```bash
'cat result_system_check | mail -s "system check results" root@uzuro.com

```

You can have the system check automatically fill out the result_system_check file and send an email.
