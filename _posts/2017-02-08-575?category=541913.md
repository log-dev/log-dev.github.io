Create Streak Background

You can find stripes of different sizes, colors, and angles in almost any visual design.

The way you apply stripes usually creates each isolated image, which requires image editing each time to modify it.

Sometimes SVG is used, which also requires separate files and unfamiliar syntax.

To minimize the hassle, you can make your own stripes using CSS3, so let`s find out how.

### Default Streak Background

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/OWopQE?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=OWopQE&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;pen-title=%EC%A4%84%EB%AC%B4%EB%8A%AC%20%EB%B0%B0%EA%B2%BD%20%231&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="줄무늬 배경 #1" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_OWopQE"></iframe>

50% of #fb3 color starts at 0% first, ends at 50% point, and #5ba color starts at 50% and draws a background image up to 100%.

In other words, if you stop the color at the same point, you can see that the gradient does not appear and is divided into two solid colors.

The background image can be resized to `background-size` just like any other background image because the background image was created with gradient.

`background-size: 100% 30px;` causes each stripe height to appear as 15px and causes the background to be repeated and filled with horizontal stripes.

To avoid adjusting two numbers (50% in the example) each time to change the width of the stripes, you can use the benefits of the CSS3 specification as follows:

This means that if you set the position of the second color to zero, the position will be adjusted by the browser to the same position as the previous color stop.

Therefore, the following code produces the same gradient, which is more concise than the declaration defined above.

```css
background: linear-gradient(#fb3 50%, #5ba 0);
```

Tricolor Horizontal Streak Style

Vertical Streak

Horizontal stripes are relatively easy codes, but not all stripes we encounter on the web are horizontal.

You can also see many vertical stripes, and diagonal (45 degrees) stripes are the most popular.

These stripes can also be used to represent stripes of different difficulty levels.

The horizontal stripes and codes are almost the same, but the big difference is that they add the first argument that specifies the direction of the gradient.

In longitudinal stripes, use the default (to bottom. Specify another `background-size`.

The linear-gradient of w3c without the manufacturer`s vendor prefix will progress from top to bottom (the same as with vendor prefix) if no keyword or angle is set.

And 0deg represents gradation from bottom to top, 90deg represents gradation from left to right, 180deg represents gradation from top to bottom, 270deg represents gradation from left to right.

In other words, 0deg of the standard specification, not vendor-freefix, proceeds counterclockwise based on the bottom of the y-axis.

### Gradient Properties Tips

The `linear-gradient` property, which is the criterion for the `-webkit-linear-gradient` property, differs from the property used with the manufacturer`s prefix indicating the gradient progression direction.

First, `to` is used to indicate the progress direction of the gradient property.

Here`s the code.

```css
background: linear-gradient(to right, #000, #fff)
```

Second, the direction of progress is the opposite of the property used with the manufacturer`s prefix.

This is because in Apple`s initial proposed `linear-gradient` property specification, 0deg indicates east (left small right), while 0deg is defined as north (bottom to top) in W3C specification.

If the W3C specification is applied to the `linear-gradient` property with the manufacturer`s prefix, the original specification of the manufacturer is maintained because all sites using the previous specification will fail.

For a detailed history of changes to the `linear-gradient` property, refer to the following link:

Syntax : -webkit-linear-gradient and manufacturer gradient

```css
-webkit-linear-gradient(<direction>,<color-stop>[,<color-stop>]+)
```

diagonal stripes

If you have learned horizontal and vertical stripes above, you can try to make diagonal stripes (45deg) by adjusting the orientation of the `background-size` and gradient.
