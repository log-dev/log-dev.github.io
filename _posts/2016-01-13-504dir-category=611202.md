Access to folders and files through Explorer is still inconvenient in Windows 10. There are many overlapping elements that are newly added, so the explorer in the default setting looks complicated, so we`ll show you how to reset it.

### Explorer Extension

Clover, which adds a bookmark and tab function similar to a Chrome browser, still works on Windows 10.

This reduces the effort of running and navigating through multiple probes to move and copy files between files, and also allows you to tap on frequently opened and closed folders.

### Explorer Shortcuts

The first screen shown when you run Windows Explorer is set to the shortcut page. In addition to the fixed shortcuts, recently used files and folders are displayed and displayed on both the left and right panels.

To make this change, you must access the folder options through File > Folder at the top of the Explorer and by changing the search options.

- The drop-down menu in Open File Explorer on the General tab allows you to change the first screen of the Explorer to your PC (most likely familiar with this setting).
- The most recent use of privacy on the General tab can be unchecked to prevent unsecured files and folders from being displayed in shortcuts.

### Explorer Library

If you use the library function well, you can gather scattered data in various places and easily access it. However, most people store data in one photo folder and one music folder, so they are often treated as a nuisance that only occupies the place of the explorer. Windows 10 added the ability to hide this library as shown below.

- Access the folder options by changing the file > folder and search options at the top of the navigator.
- If you turn off the check box for the library display in the navigation pane area of the View tab`s advanced settings, the library is not displayed.
- When you enable the display of all folders in the navigation pane of the View tab`s advanced settings, the reverse displays all of them.

### Explorer Disk

When using SATA settings as AHCI, all disks connected to the system often look like external disk connections as shown below. If you install an Intel® Rapid Storage driver from a mainboard manufacturer or Intel, it will return to normal, but you can still use it.

In Windows 10, I wanted to increase accessibility by marking the disks except those with operating system installed, but it is usually just a nuisance (no setup menu) when accessing my PC).

In fact, one of the reasons why disks look like this is associated with hot-swap/hot plug-ins. This is because they mark SATA ports that can be hot-swapped in that way. In BIOS/UEFI settings (ex. Advanced\Storage Configuration) Mainboards that can set whether or not to support hot-swap for each SATA port are normally seen when changed to Disabled.

If you connect USB, the disk is marked separately because it is an external disk.

If the mainboard manufacturer does not provide a Rapid Storage driver, if the Intel driver does not work properly, or if BIOS/UEFI does not support hot-swap setup, the registry may be modified directly.

> Personally, I do not recommend modifying the registry.

### OneDrive

The Explorer`s OneDrive can also be removed, and there is an official document called OneDrive release or removal, so let`s refer to it.
