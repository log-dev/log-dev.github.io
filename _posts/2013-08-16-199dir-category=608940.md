The Ubuntu 12.04 version of vsftpd has 2.3.5 installed (current standard - 2013.08.15). There is a problem with applying `chroot` in this version. If you plan to run an FTP server without this feature, you will need to install version vsftpd 3.0 if you need to apply chroot.

### Install VSFTP

Find out how to install two versions.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install vsftpd

```

Install the desired 32/64 bits from the download.

The following is an example of a 64-bit application.

```bash
"# Download using wget
$ wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/v/vsftpd/vsftpd_3.0.2-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb

# Installation
$ sudo dpkg -i vsftpd_3.0.2-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb

# Open Settings File to Modify
$ sudo vi /etc/vsftpd.conf
chroot_local_user=YES
allow_writeable_chroot=YES

# Restart
$ sudo restart vsftpd

```

### VSFTP Settings

After setting it by referring to the values below, save it and restart vsftpd.

```undefined
'# Open Settings File
$ sudo vi /etc/vsftpd.conf

# Anonymous user is not allowed
anonymous_enable=NO

# Account users can access
local_enable=YES

# Uploadable
write_enable=YES

# umask value when creating directory or file
local_umask=022

# Message me when connecting
ftpd_banner=Welcome to uzuro FTP service

# Set the output message when connecting (when connecting using shell, etc.)
# In your home directory.creating in message file
dirmessage_enable=YES

# Apply chroot
# Users will not be able to move from their accounts to their parent directories with the following settings:
chroot_local_user=YES

# When Jail is set for a specific user only
# Only apply chroot to accounts registered in chroot_list
chroot_list_enable=YES
chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd/chroot_list

# When Jail is set for only users except specific users
# chroot_list excludes registered accounts and chroot is jammed in their accounts
chroot_local_user=YES
chroot_list_enable=YES
chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd/chroot_list

# When setting dynamic for each account
# If you set it as below, you can set the jail by referring to the /etc/passwd file.
# /etc/passwd If you modify the file to take . to the path, the point becomes the chroot point.
# theeye:x:600:100::/home/./theeye:/bin/bash
chroot_local_user=YES
passwd_chroot_enable=YES

```

### Change FTP Directory

When vsftpd is installed, ftp users are automatically created and designated as `/srv/ftp` in the home directory. Let`s change this.

```bash
# Create directory to use
$ sudo mkdir /home/ftp

# Change the home directory of ftp users
$ sudo usermod -d /home/ftp ftp

# Restart
$ sudo restart vsftpd

```

### Register a user to deny FTP access

If an ID is registered one per line, the user is denied access.

```bash
"# Sign up here
$ sudo vi /etc/ftpusers

# Restart
$ sudo restart vsftpd

```
