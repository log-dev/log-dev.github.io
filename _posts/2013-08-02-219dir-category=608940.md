Munin is a tool that graphically shows network, CPU, and various input/output values. The plug-in also lets you monitor Apache and MySQL.

It is under the assumption that an Apache web server is installed in Ubuntu.

### Munin Installation

The munin collects information from the system where the munin-node is installed. Unless multiple servers are physically used, a single server is installed with a munin and a munin-node.

Currently, Ubuntu 12.04 has an error installing version 1.4.6 of the munin, so it is recommended to install the latest version through PPA.

```bash
sudo apt-get install munin munin-node

```

(Munin PPA Installation)

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tuxpoldo/munin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install munin munin-node
dpkg -l munin

```

munin : Master / munin-node : node

### Munin Settings

It is classified as Mster and node.

The master setup file is the /etc/munin/munin.conf file.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/munin/munin.conf

```

The following four directories are automatically created during package installation and each related file exists there. Among them, htmldir is the directory in which the munin will run on the web page, which can be modified to where desired.

```bash
# dbdir /var/lib/munin
# htmldir /var/cache/munin/www
# logdir /var/log/munin
# rundir /var/run/munin

```

If you plan to run one website on one web server with node information that is set by default, there is no problem using only the default values. Additionally, nodes are added to the bottom of this zone for information divided by virtual hosts.

```undefined
[localhost.localdomain]
address 127.0.0.1
use_node_name yes

```

Add Virtual Host Example)

```undefined
[www.uzuro.com]
address 127.0.0.1
use_node_name yes

```

The master should be allowed to access the setting file of the node. By default, 127.0.0.1 is set.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/munin/munin-node.conf

allow ^127\.0\.0\.1$

```

Add Virtual Host Example)

```undefined
host 127.0.0.1
host_name admin.uzuro.com

```

### Apache Settings

The munin installation creates a /etc/munin/apache.conf file, which establishes a symbolic link to /etc/apache2/conf.d/munin. If you are using a virtual host, you can copy it to that virtual host and set it up.

The following values are accessible only from localhost.

```undefined
sudo vi /etc/apache2/conf.d/munin

Alias /munin /var/cache/munin/www
<Directory /var/cache/munin/www>
Order allow,deny
Allow from localhost 127.0.0.0/8 ::1
# Add IP to connect to settings to connections
Allow from 192.168.0.3
Options None

<IfModule mod_expires.c>
ExpiresActive On
ExpiresDefault M310
</IfModule>
</Directory>

```

If you want to make it accessible anywhere without restricting IP access, use .htaccess to remove access, do the following. The use of the .htaccess file must be authorized in the Apache settings.

```undefined
Alias /munin /var/cache/munin/www
<Directory /var/cache/munin/www>
AllowOverride All
Order allow,deny
Allow from All
Options None

<IfModule mod_expires.c>
ExpiresActive On
ExpiresDefault M310
</IfModule>
</Directory>

```

Create a .htaccess file and place it in /var/cache/munin/www.

```undefined
sudo vi /var/cache/munin/www/.htaccess

; Location of the file to store the user's ID and password.
AuthUserFile /etc/munin/.htpasswd

; Name that will appear in the authentication window
AuthName "Munin"

; Authentication method
AuthType Basic
require valid-user

```

Create a .htpasswd file.

```bash
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/munin/.htpasswd` ID

; Enter Password
New password:

; Re-enter password
Re-type new password:

```

Restart Apache

```bash
sudo servicce apache2 restart

```

### Check Munin

In the case of Munin, the information of registered nodes at one Munin site is shown separately. If you are restricting it to IP, as in the above preferences, you will not be able to access it by domain name.

Therefore, it connects to http://localhost/munin or http://ip address/munin.

### Munin Plug-in

Plugins available in Munin are stored in /usr/share/munin/plugins. These plugins only collect information about the symbolic links in /etc/munin/plugins.

Plug-in Active/Inactive List

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/munin-node-configure

```

Determining if the plug-in is functioning

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/munin-node-configure --suggest

```

After adding or deleting a plug-in, the node must be restarted as shown below.

```bash
sudo service munin-node restart

```

Determine whether the plug-in is working properly or not first.

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/munin-node-configure --suggest

```

An error occurs.

An error such as [LWP::UserAgent not found] occurs. Munin is written in Perl and `LWP::UserAgent` is the Perl library.

Install Perl Library

```bash
sudo apt-get install libwww-perl

```

Judge Plug-in for normal operation

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/munin-node-configure --suggest

```

[no apache server-status or ExtendedStatus missing on ports 80] 에러가 발생한다. This enables the server-status module of the Apache and turns on the value of ExtendedStatus.

Activate Plug-in

Use the command below to automatically activate the plug-in after troubleshooting.

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/munin-node-configure --shell | sudo sh

```

Sometimes authentication fails due to continuous operation with sudo, and you can enter the command using sudo once and run the command immediately above.

Or you can symbolic link only what you need.

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/apache_* /etc/munin/plugins/

```

Determine whether the plug-in is working properly or not first.

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/munin-node-configure --suggest

```

Errors such as [Missing dependency Cache::Cache] occur.

Install the relevant library.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcache-cache-perl

```

Activate Plug-in

Use the command below to automatically activate the plug-in after troubleshooting.

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/munin-node-configure --shell | sudo sh

```

Sometimes authentication fails due to continuous operation with sudo, and you can enter the command using sudo once and run the command immediately above.

Or you can symbolic link only what you need.

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/share/munin/plugins/mysql_* /etc/munin/plugins/

```

If you installed mysql as a Ubuntu base and did not modify the automatically set user debian-sys-main, you can use it as it is. If you have compiled mysql or modified the debian-sys-main user, you need to adjust it.

Add to [mysql*] section as follows:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node

[mysql*]
env.Mysqlofts -uroot -p password
env.mysqladmin /usr/bin/mysqladmin

```

restart node

```bash
sudo service munin-node restart
sudo service apache2 restart

```

After looking at the log, three errors occur.

```bash
tail -f /var/log/munin/munin-node.log

```

If you look up the related information, it is said that it has already been patched, but it seems that the PPA version installed was not the best. I think I need to download and install the patched version. I don`t know if it`s in the latest version, but...

```

So I just removed the three plug-ins.

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/munin/plugins/mysql_replication
sudo rm -rf /etc/munin/plugins/mysql_innodb_io_pend
sudo rm -rf /etc/munin/plugins/mysql_innodb_insert_buf

```
