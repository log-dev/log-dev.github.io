There are more places to join the website and it is not easy to remember the ID or password. If you use the same thing, once it`s leaked, it`s crazy. So I find a program that manages passwords and find and share what I can manage locally.

### Keepass Introduction

Keepass is a free, open-source password manager that helps you manage passwords in a secure way. A system that holds all passwords in one database and locks them into one master key or key file.

You only need to remember the password for one master key file or select a key file that unlock the entire database. The database is encrypted using the most secure encryption algorithms known to date (AES and Twoofish).

- A database can be created on a local machine, which can be used as an alternative to Internet security.
- It is available in two versions: Classic Edition and Professional Edition, and the latest version of Professional Edition requires the installation of the .Net Framework, but offers more options and features.
- Because keepass does not install anything on the system, there is no difference between the installation version and the portable version.

See Keepass Functional Description for a detailed description.

### Install Keepass

Let`s download the latest version from the homepage.

- If you run the installation file, you can choose a language, but Korean is not provided in the installation stage, so let`s just install it in English.
- Install it as a default without any specific setting to touch.
- When the installation is completed and Keepass is executed, it is terminated first.
- As a translation is provided, download the Korean translation file and copy it to the installation folder C:\Program Files (x86)\KePassword Safe 2.
- If you re-run Keepass and select View > Change Language to select Korean, the program restarts and changes to Korean.

### How to use Keepass

- Choose File > New > Database Name and Storage Location
- Create Composite Master Key : Set Master Password > OK
- Create a new password database - Step 2:
You can enter information about the database on the General tab. (You do not need to enter.)
The values on the other tabs can be used with the default values.
- You can enter information about the database on the General tab. (You do not need to enter.)
- The values on the other tabs can be used with the default values.

- Right-click > Add Item
- Enter Item Information: Importantly, instead of entering arbitrary names in the Subject field, it is recommended that you enter a given title because the letters in the title bar of your Internet browser must match the Subject field to the same site.

Depending on the site, sometimes you need to enter not only your ID and password, but also your resident registration number and name. While most password management programs simply support the storage of "id/password", KeePass can add as many fields as it wants to, and manage multiple entries at once.

- Add or Modify Items > Select the Advanced tab - Add button
- Enter "Field Name" and "Value" when the entry window for the entry string opens (ex. Even if you enter your social security number, you must enter the front and back digits separately, so enter the fields separately).
- If you fill in both fields, you will see the two fields entered in the "string field".
- You should go back to the Auto-Input tab and override the sequence column. Click "Override default order column" and click "Modify" on the right.
- When the Key Input Sequence column setting window opens, check "Use Custom Key Input Sequence Column" and set the order in which it is entered. When entered, all commands are displayed at the bottom, so it is automatically entered when you click the command you want to use.
If you enter your resident registration number and log in after entering your password:
{First digit of resident number}{TAB} {Number Back Seat}{TAB}{Password}{ENTER}
When typed, auto login shortcuts are pressed, all entries are automatically entered and even logged in.

### Keepass Options

Below is the content of setting options for me. Go to Tools > Options

- Interface tab:
Check to minimize main window instead of exit application with close button [x]
Check Minimize to Tray instead of Taskbar
- Check to minimize main window instead of exit application with close button [x]
- Check Minimize to Tray instead of Taskbar
- Integrated tab: Specify a shortcut for global auto-entry, click the login form of the site you want, and press the shortcut key to automatically enter your ID and password and log in.
Check to run KeePass on Windows startup (current user)
- Check to run KeePass on Windows startup (current user)

### Keepass Plug-in

Select one of the official plug-ins to use. I use the following things.

This is a plug-in that allows you to add a Pavicon to the title of the list you have added.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2551B0405560F35C1A)

After creating and moving the downloaded KeePassFaviconDownloader.plgx plug-in to the KeePass directory, it restarts KeepPass.

It is used in conjunction with Google Chrome`s Chrome IPass extension.

Create and move the downloaded KeePassHttp.plgx plug-in to the KeePass directory called plugins. Restart the KeePass.

- Returns all matching entries for the entered URL
- Update Items
- Secure exchange of items
- Notify users when items are forwarded
- Users can grant/deny access to one item
- Only works when the database is unlocked
- When in lockdown mode during connection, request to unlock database
- Scan all open databases (when user enabled this feature)
- Whenever an event occurs, the user is asked to notify the tray or interact.

It is not enough to handle a web browser using the global auto-input shortcut. One of them is the failure to log in due to the switch between Korea and the U. It is an extension that helps you copy and paste automatically.

After installing the extension, information is obtained using the URL address of the item.

When you visit the login page, Chrome IPass icon appears in Chrome`s address window and is marked x. Click the icon to confirm the password and the x mark disappears.

If you decide on a key name, the connection will begin.

After that, when you first access the page you want to log in, a notification window will appear and you can allow it.

It is a plug-in that synchronizes the Keepass database with Google Drive. Let`s use only those who believe in Google.

- Manual synchronization from the Tools menu
- Enable/Disable Synchronization on Save
- Download, Upload, and Bi-directional Sync

Installation Guide: http://kaa-ching.blogspot.nl/2012/12/improved-manual-for-keepass-google-sync.html

Google Sync plugin is divided into three categories for use in KeePass.

- Communication between KeePass and Google Drive
- Set up your Google Account on KeePass
- Edit KeePass Settings File

Let`s take a closer look at the three steps.

Step 1: Communication between KeePass and Google Drive

You need to activate what is called "OAuth 2.0" on Google Drive.

Go to https://code.google.com/apis/console and select API Access from the left menu. (If you can`t access the screen that shows this menu, try repeating it a few times.)

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2407E043556102D53E)

- If the menu that generates the OAuth 2.0 client ID does not appear when accessing API Access, and the client ID is already created, you can pass the process.
- Create an OAuth 2.0 client ID 클릭
- Product name: Enter KeePass, click Next
- Application type: Installed application을 선택, Installed application type: Other 선택하고 Create client ID 클릭

The Client ID and Client secret values are shown on the screen. This value is used for the KeePass setting.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2669C13E556103F909)

Next, you need to activate the Google Drive API.

- Select Service from the left menu
- After finding the Drive API, turn on the off value.

Step 2: Set up your Google Account on KeePass

If you have already registered a Google account with KeePass, you can pass it.

- Add an item and add a Google account.
- Tab with the property value and uuid is shown.
- This value is used for the KeePass setting.

Step 3: Edit KeePass Settings File

- Unzip the plug-in file downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/kp-googlesync/files/Plugin%20for%20KeePass%202.20.1/.
- Create and move the GoogleSyncPlugin.plgx file into the KeePass directory called plugins.
- Open the Sample-KePass.config.xml file and copy the parts 부분을 ~ /Custom.
HTML
` <Custom>
<Item>
<Key>EnableAutoSync</Key>
<Value>false</Value>
</Item>
<Item>
<Key>GoogleSyncClientID</Key>
<Value>{google api client id}</Value>
</Item>
<Item>
<Key>GoogleSyncClientSecret</Key>
<Value>{google api client secret}</Value>
</Item>
<Item>
<Key>GoogleSyncKeePassUID</Key>
<Value>{keepass google account UID}</Value>
</Item>
<Item>
<Key>GoogleSyncShowAuthenticationForm</Key>
<Value>false</Value>
</Item>
</Custom>
`
- KeePass uses a setup file called "KePass.config.xml". If you are using an installation version, the file will exist in the same location as the file KePass.exe if you are using the portable version and C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\KePass\KePass.config.xml.
Open the KeePass.config.xml file and paste the copy above, but if you had installed other plug-ins, the <custom> part already exists, so copy and paste only the <itme> part.
HTML
` <Custom>
<Item>
<Key>KeePassHttp_ReceiveCredentialNotification</Key>
<Value>true</Value>
</Item>

... (Skip)

<Item>
<Key>EnableAutoSync</Key>
<Value>true</Value>
</Item>
<Item>
<Key>GoogleSyncClientID</Key>
<Value>xxxxx482019.apps.googleusercontent.com</Value>
</Item>
<Item>
<Key>GoogleSyncClientSecret</Key>
<Value>xxxxxxxxxx4dbRMCql2EA3ql</Value>
</Item>
<Item>
<Key>GoogleSyncKeePassUID</Key>
<Value>xxxxxxxFA44CAC478FC951F53916</Value>
</Item>
<Item>
<Key>GoogleSyncShowAuthenticationForm</Key>
<Value>false</Value>
</Item>
</Custom>
</Configuration>
`
- Paste it as above and put the value of the value that fits the key.
EnableAutoSync : Automatic synchronization true/false when DB changes
GoogleSyncClientID: Enter the Client ID value obtained in Step 1.
GoogleSyncClientSecret: Enter the ClientSecret value obtained in Step 1.
GoogleSyncKePassUID: Enter the UUID value of the Google Account obtained in Step 2.
Google SyncShow AuthenticationForm: True, two-factor authentication is required to show the Google Authentication Form. Basically, it is left in false and used a lot.
From the top menu bar, select Tools > Google SyncPlugin > Upload to Google Drive to save the DB file on Google Drive. If the EnableAutoSync value is set to true above, it will automatically connect to Google Drive and update the file whenever the DB contents are modified.
Troubleshooting
There was a problem opening, modifying, and saving the KeePass setup file with notepad. The saved contents were not reflected or returned to the contents before modification, so I closed KeePass, saved it again, checked it, etc. repeatedly.
Full version of .NET Framework 4 is required, not client version.
