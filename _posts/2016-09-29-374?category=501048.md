JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming

Let`s take a quick look at the constructors, prototype instances, properties and methods, class properties and methods, and private members, among other things that can be called object-oriented programming.

### What is a JavaScript constructor?

In multiple object-oriented programming languages, you can define a class of objects and then create individual objects corresponding to instances of that class.

JavaScript does not support true classes, but provides a constructor function that creates JavaScript objects.

A JavaScript constructor is a function used to create JavaScript objects.

The JavaScript constructor is used with the new operator, which first creates a new object that does not have a property, then calls the constructor function, passes the new object to the value of this keyword, and sets the property that must be set before the object is used.

The constructor function can be defined directly, just write a function that adds the property to this.

Take a look at the following example:

```js
function Point(x,y){
this.x = x;
this.y = y;
// Normal constructor function has no return value.
}

point1 = new Point(5,5);
point2 = new Point(8,8);

console.log(JSON.stringify(point1));
console.log(JSON.stringify(point2));
```

### JavaScript Prototype

Every JavaScript object has an internal reference to its prototype object and inherits the property from the prototype object.

Every function has a prototype property that is automatically generated and initialized when the function is defined.

The properties that you add to these prototype objects appear as object properties initialized as constructors.

Examples of JavaScript prototypes are as follows:

```js
function Point(x,y){
this.x = x;
this.y = y;
}

Point.prototype.add = function(){
return this.x + this.y;
}

point1 = new Point(5,5);
point2 = new Point(8,8);

console.log(point1.add()); // 10
console.log(point2.add()); // 16
```

Methods and properties can be dynamically added to a prototype even after an object is created.

Let`s take a look at the following example:

```js
function Point(x,y){
this.x = x;
this.y = y;
}

// Create object first
point1 = new Point(5,5);
point2 = new Point(8,8);

// Add Method to Prototype
Point.prototype.add = function(){
return this.x + this.y;
}

console.log(point1.add()); // 10
console.log(point2.add()); // 16
```

Why write JavaScript prototypes?

The benefits of JavaScript prototypes include:

- You can use object-oriented and inheritance.
- Prototype objects allow objects to inherit many of the prototype`s properties, significantly reducing the amount of memory each object requires.

### Instance Properties and Methods

JavaScript is an object-oriented language, it can have multiple objects from the same class (creator function), and each object corresponds to an instance of that class.

Instance Properties

Every object has its own copy of the instance property.

Let`s take a look at the following example:

```js
function Point(x,y){
this.x = x;
this.y = y;
}

point1 = new Point(5,5);
point2 = new Point(8,8);

console.log(point1.x); // 5
console.log(point2.y); // 8
```

You can access instance properties through individual objects (for example, point1.x).

Instance Method

The instance method is called to a specific instance or object.

When implementing an instance method, you can use this keyword to reference the instance or object on which to invoke the method.

Let`s take the next example.

```js
function Point(x,y){
this.x = x;
this.y = y;
}

// Create object first
point1 = new Point(5,5);
point2 = new Point(8,8);

// Add Method to Prototype
Point.prototype.add = function(){
return this.x + this.y;
}

console.log(point1.add()); // 10
console.log(point2.add()); // 16
```

The instance method is shared by all instances of the class.

### Class Properties and Methods

If you`ve learned about instance properties and methods above, here`s an overview of class properties and methods.

Class Properties

In JavaScript, a class property is a property that is not associated with each instance of the class, but with the class itself.

Regardless of how many instances of a class are created, each class property exists only one.

To define a class property in JavaScript, simply define it as a property of the constructor function itself.

This is because the JavaScript function is also an object.

Let`s take the next example.

```js
function Circle(r){
this.radius = r;
}

// Define Class Properties
Circle.PI = 3.14159265;

Circle.prototype.area = function(){
return Circle.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
}

c1 = new Circle(10);

console.log(c1.area()); // 314.159265

```

Class Method

A class method is a method associated with a class that is not an instance of the class.

To define a class method in JavaScript, you simply make the appropriate function a property of the constructor.

This keyword does not refer to a specific instance of the class because the class method is called through the constructor function.

So we usually don`t use this at all in class methods.

Examples of class methods include:

```js
function Point(x,y){
this.x = x;
this.y = y;
}

// Define Class Method
Point.getHigherPoint = function(a,b){
if (a.x > b.x) return a;
else return b;
}

point1 = new Point(5,5);
point2 = new Point(8,8);

console.log(Point.getHigherPoint(point1, point2).y); // 8
```

### Private Members and Methods

In JavaScript, private members are made as constructors, and variables defined using the var keyword and parameters of the constructor become private members.

Private members cannot be accessed outside the constructor function, only within the constructor function.

This is called data encapsulation.

Examples include:

```js
function Circle(r){
// Private Properties
var radius = r;

// Private Method
var getArea = function(){
return Circle.PI * radius * radius;
}

// Public Method
this.area = function(){return getArea()}
}

// Define Class Properties
Circle.PI = 3.14159265;

c1 = new Circle(10);

console.log(c1.area()); // 314.159265
```
