We will learn about the icon font, another evolutionary form of webfont, and the website that provides it, and ultimately discuss how to insert only the icons we want.

### Appearance of Icon Font

Traditionally, special fonts or icons were used to be produced in image formats and inserted into web documents. This caused many HTTP requests, which loaded the server and affected the loading speed. To overcome this, one of the CSS techniques, the Image Sprite method, is recommended to produce multiple images as background images that are included in one large image and insert them into the document via a single HTTP request.

> As far as I remember, Yahoo first used the Image Sprite method, and it became widely used on Google, large sites, and domestic forums. Most sites with many HTTP requests used this method.

This, coupled with the flooding of smartphone use, resulted in more and more devices offering a variety of DPI1s, showing different results from the screens shown at fixed resolution (pixel) to the desktop in the past (force images to appear blurry or broken). In addition, as it was inserted as a background image, the disadvantages of being very uncomfortable with size changes or image modifications began to be highlighted.

Fonts were already widely distributed via webfont, and Google Webfont contributed greatly to this. However, due to the poor Internet environment in Korea - IE-dependent environment, lack of user awareness that old IE usage rate is high and should be updated, the short-sighted attitude of producers, and lack of free Korean fonts that can be used as webfonts, etc., the use of domestic webfonts was low.

It was a time when research was actively conducted to provide a beautiful image in smartphones overseas. Although SVG was also used to replace images that were broken without responding to the screen size of various devices, older browsers and popularized browsers were unable to support SVG by default at the time. To overcome this, the method of making and using vector-type icons as webfonts was used, and the icon collection webfont called FontAwesom was provided free of charge, accelerating the study of icon fonts. Currently, various web font providers have been created, and recently, domestic XEICON has been produced, which can realize its popularity.

### Icon Font Features

Icon font is also a web font, so it inherits its advantages and disadvantages.

- It can be used by placing various characters (icon) in one font and calling them.
- With scalable vector graphics, all icons can be changed to any size.
- Any work possible with CSS is possible.
- If the icon font provider supports Unicode for the font, it can be inserted into all elements in Unicode format and used locally.
- Webfont`s old browser support is not unified, so various font formats need to be prepared.

### How to use the icon font

Most icon font services provide CDN. By inserting the CDN into `head` in the form of a style sheet, the icon font can be called to a specific class name and used. Below is an example of the use of FontAwesome.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.4.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">

```

If CDN is not enabled, the path to the downloaded icon font file must be modified to suit the desired path.

In order to print the imported icon font on the screen, a specific tag must be given a class name that matches the desired icon. Most HTML5 uses the `i` tag, which does not have any special meaning and adds singularities in terms of visual aspects.

```html
<i class="fa fa-camera-retro"></i>

```

> You don't have to use the <i> tag alone, but it can be everything you want. Depending on the icon font service, the tag may be different, just like Font Awesome.Define icon common style in fa' and `.It can be used for most tags if the value of the icon's content property is expressed in fa-camera-retro.

If you look into the CSS file of icon font, most of them have a similar structure. Below is the part that declares the font name and path. It is similar to the usual Webfont declaration method.

```css
@font-face {
font-family: 'FontAwesome';
src: url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?v=4.4.0');
src: url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?#iefix
```

When downloading an icon font, it contains several files in the folder name, such as fonts, and the path to it is set above.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/23112242560E6E4D07)

- What is TTF and OTF about otf and ttf file format? Let`s refer to the article.
- The eot file format is for older IE.
- woff and woff2 are files for modern browsers.
- The svg file format is for older mobile devices that do not support woff.

A style declaration corresponding to a common class used in icon fonts. Font Awesome`s case is as follows.Declare this using `fa` and the shape of the icon is `.It is decided by `fa-shaped class name`.

```css
.fa {
display: inline-block;
font: normal normal normal 14px/1 FontAwesome;
font-size: inherit;
text-rendering: auto;
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}

.fa-glass:before {
content: "\f000";
}

```

### Browser support in icon font

As seen above, the content property is represented using the `:before` selector in the CSS declaration for icon fonts. Because this is an option that supports IE8 and later browsers, older browsers below IE7 cannot express this. In other words, it supports both IE 8 and later and other modern browsers, and works on older Android 2.x devices on mobile, so it works on almost any browser.

In order to use the icon font in IE7, it is necessary to use attribute selectors such as `class^="icon-"] instead of `:before` selectors, and to add expressions only for IE7 that do not support content properties.

```css
[class^="icon-"],
[class*=" icon-"] {
font-family: FontAwesome;
font-weight: normal;
font-style: normal;
text-decoration: inherit;
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
*margin-right: .3em;
}

.icon-glass {
*zoom: expression( this.runtimeStyle['zoom'] = '1', this.innerHTML = 'Unicode');
}

```

The icon font service should support the icon code, such as Unicode, since it is a way to insert it into a tag. In fact, many webfont services mark this through cheat sheets.

As with most of the cases, the use of IE7 is not being considered abroad, and IE8 is being removed one by one from the support, so there is no room for concern. Font Awesome also supports IE7 only in the older version of 3.x, and current versions with many icons added do not officially support it. However, only the Cheatsheet, which can know Unicode, is provided, so individuals can only support IE7.

Font Awesome Unicode

One mistake made by IconFont providers was that they overestimated IE8. In fact, IE8 does not seem to have a problem representing webfonts, but the problem is different for IE8 used in XP. Most of them show unsuspecting icons without being processed, and if they are used with the `:before` selector, even this cannot be guaranteed to be 100% displayed.

In some cases, when the icon is marked blank and an action such as a refresh or a mouse is taken, it often appears only then. There have been reports of this problem in communities such as Font Awesome and the Glyphics provided by Bootstrap, but they have long refused to acknowledge it. It was said to be a problem that did not occur in their testing environment, but only after a steady report of the same problem was made in XP IE8 on the actual virtual machine, it was recognised of a particular situation in IE8.

> I have also had several days of concern using the solutions presented in IE8 due to the above icon flickering and blanking problems. Eventually, he turned to Unicode, but...

This problem is caused by `:before` selection, so we need to look at it carefully. The reason why most icon fonts use this selector is that icons are not meaningful and are used to emphasize only visual aspects. In fact, when devices such as screen readers approach them, they will only encounter tags with nothing, which can reduce confusion. If this method is not used and a method similar to IE7 support method that displays Unicode in the tag, the screen reader may cause misunderstanding of the character. In other words, it causes problems with accessibility.

The solution is to use icon fonts in the form of inserting Unicode to maintain compatibility with older IE (7,8) - although they may have a negative impact on accessibility, or to allow older IE to replace icon fonts with image icons instead of calling them.

### Recommended icon font

This is a list of sites that provide icon fonts.

It is an icon font that is rugged but offers a wide variety of icons, and is constantly updated. The optional classes can be used to easily increase the size of icons, list icons at fixed widths, set borders, and rotate them.

The Glyphicon Halflings set contains about 250 icons. The same is true of ruggedness, and the original production company did not offer it free of charge, but it was provided at no cost for bootstraps. Most sites manufactured with bootstrap use font Awesome and Glyphicons.

It is an icon font service that is provided in Korea and provides a pretty beautiful design. However, since it is still an early service, there are still difficulties such as the fact that the tag itself is not configured to be used for other purposes and that a cheat sheet is not provided to check Unicode. Of course, you can modify the styles set in the tag and use them.

It is an icon font that I often use for commercial use, providing a neat thin icon font. There are many icons that do not provide many numbers, but have a different atmosphere from other icon fonts.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/21086F38560E7FE73A)

It is a simple and minimal form of icon provided by Google. It offers about 750 icons and is rugged but simple.

The biggest feature is that it includes an IcoMoon application that allows users to create their own icon font sets using a font library that is provided for free and for free. You can set options for older browser support, use class names, and specify Unicode.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/225AF934560E935222)

When you run the IcoMoon App, there are several basic font libraries set up, and the Icon Library menu allows you to add the icons you want to your font library.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/24294E4D560E950308)

Once you have added the font libraries you want, you can choose from them to make them into icon fonts and make detailed changes in the settings.

Most of all, SVG files can be uploaded through the Import Icons menu, so they are highly utilized. Because IcoMoon offers chrome extensions, it also offers a more reliable use of applications available on the web, and has the advantage of being able to store projects and keep them in json files at any time.

Fontello also offers similar services to the above IcoMoon. Basically, it shows a page with integrated applications on its homepage and adds the SVG icon you want to create and download your own icon font. Everything is provided free of charge, with old browser support and embedded icon fonts.

If you press the setting icon to select the Advanced font settings menu, additional settings are possible, and if you look at the downloaded file, you can find the `embed.css` file and the `ie7.css` file, which helps cross-browsing.

### Create Icon Font

As mentioned above, IcoMoon and Fontello said they could upload SVG files to create their own icon font set. This means that you can upload a number of free SVG files that are not provided by default, but can be used in other icon fonts, or that many free SVG files exist on the web. Without SVG files, SVG files can be obtained through a variety of tools that convert PNG files to SVG, and the icon font delivery services introduced above also provide SVG files for downloading, so they have the opportunity to extract and use only what they want. You can find free quality icons on the web, such as the Pickeden - Free Icons Sets.
