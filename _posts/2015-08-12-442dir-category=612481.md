There are times when I want to mark the current user on the website or blog. Google Analytics and Naver Analytics have more features, including this, but if you want simple functions and widget display, we recommend the widgets described below.

### Introducing who's amung.us

It provides free real-time statistics on websites or blogs. The Pro version is paid and supports more features. When you add a widget code to a blog or website page, it starts working. The widget shows the number of people (current users) browsing the current website. It also provides plug-ins for Chrome and Firefox.

Clicking on a widget shows a detailed real-time statistics page.

- Visitors can check the amount of simultaneous access to the site by time.
- You can check the list of pages you are currently reading. Indicate the time of stay next to each page. In addition, the most popular pages can be changed to view and how many people are gathered in each.
- Available as a map is not a statistical part, but you can see where you are accessing it. Express their city in real time. The red pin indicates who is currently connected and the blue pin indicates what has been accessed in the past.

### Who's amung.us Widget Usage

Selecting the widgets menu on the site provides code for each widget. I issue a new code every time I refresh it, so let`s refer to it.

It is the shape of a built-in widget.

You can choose a color and copy the code and use it.

It also offers a small widget.

It can be positioned in a fixed form on a web page. If you specify it in the desired form, the code changes, so you can copy it and use it.

Check the browser to see how many people are accessing the website.

- Chrome Plug-in
- Firefox Plug-in

### Example of applying

Typically, this is well represented when the issued code is pasted to the desired location. If you use CMS such as WordPress or T-Story, you can apply it without direct code modification using the given editing function.

It can also be inserted using a tag inputter in T-story. Of course, you can modify the skin by yourself.

- After logging in as a T-Story administrator, add a "tag inputter" for administration and statistics in "Plug-in settings".
- From the sidebar, place the tag inputter added to the main module on the desired sidebar and press the "Edit" button.
- When a pop-up window pops up, name it moderately and insert the who`s among.us widget code into the replacement box. When you check Save to User Module, it is saved to the User Module on the sidebar and can be recalled later.
- Below is a blog entry.

This method can be used for pre-version or pro-version accounts.

Hosting provided by WordPress sites (e.g., yourblogname.wordpress.com) requires slightly different code and cannot directly include a map widget. If you are operating your own installation WordPress site, the general code provided will work well.

- Access your WordPress account and select the Appearance > Widget option.
- Scroll down and select the "Text" widget option and drag it to the main sidebar area of the page.
- Give the widget area a title (if desired), and paste the widget code into a large text box. Then press the "Save" button and press the "Close" button.
- The widget will appear on your blog.

### IE8 Troubleshooting

A script distributed by amung looked for a way to emit errors in IE8 and found that it used a past-style insertion method.

```html
<div class="amung">
<a href="http://whos.amung.us/stats/cp8neo95czmf">
<img src="http://whos.amung.us/swidget/cp8neo95czmf" title="Click to see how many people are online" alt="실시간 방문자" /></a>
</div>

```

His own insertion ID (which is automatically given by the code) in the stats/back portion of the link section and the same changes are used in Img.
