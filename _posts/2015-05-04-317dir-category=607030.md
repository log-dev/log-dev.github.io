Tables are actually elements that refrain from using them. This is because tables have accessibility problems and browsers consume a lot of resources to implement them.

### Table Element

The table element indicates the table range.

```html
'<table border="1" summary="This table summarizes the grades and averages of the first and second year midterms for aesthetic subjects that are required for culture.">
<captions>Interim report cards</captions>
<tr>
<th scope="col">이름</th>
<th scope="col">학과</th>
<th scope="col">점수</th>
<th scope="col">등급</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hong Gil-dong</td>
<td>Management Department</td>
<td>90</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jeon Ji-hyun</td>
<td>English Department</td>
<td>80</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
</table>

```

- A table is a structure in which grids made by rows and columns are continuously connected, mainly used to display two-dimensional data in grid form.
- Do not use tables to control page layout.
- The semantic mark-up level of the table is not high, so refrain from doing so.
- Considering the numerous trials and errors that the browser has to undergo when rendering the table, it is also considered performance-wise.

The summary property specifies a table summary. Table summarization refers to descriptive information about tables in complex configurations, which is not recommended in HTML5.

```html
<table summary=> This table summarizes the results and averages of the first and second year midterms on aesthetics, which are required for culture.">
...
</table>

```

The summary property does not appear on the document and is only output by user tools that require that information, such as screen readers. The problem causes confusion because the summary property appears before the capture element of the table.

The border property specifies the table border line. By default, tables do not represent border lines, so you must specify border properties to make border lines visible.

```html
'<table border="1" summary="This table summarizes the grades and averages of the first and second year midterms for aesthetic subjects that are required for culture.">
...
</table>

```

HTML5 supports only 1 or "" as a property value of the border, allowing only the border to be specified or not. Other cellpadding, cellspace, frame, rules, and width are not recommended in HTML5.

### CAPTION ELEMENTS

The capture element displays the table title (CAPTION). Caption refers to a simple title or description given to a photograph or illustration, where it is interpreted as a table title.

```html
'<table border="1" summary="This table summarizes the grades and averages of the first and second year midterms for aesthetic subjects that are required for culture.">
<captions>Interim report cards</captions>
...
</table>

```

- The capture element is the title element that must be read first, so it is located immediately after the table element.
- Only one capture element can be specified per table.
- The title marked with the capture element is placed in a center alignment on the table.

### TR Element

The tr element displays a table row.

- One tr element is required to display one row.
- The tr element shall contain either the th or td element.

### TH Element

The th element displays the table header cell (hereinafter referred to as the header cell). Table cells are divided into header cells (th element) containing header information and data cells (td element) containing real data.

The header cell can be viewed as the title of the data cell, as the header refers to the head part, i.e. the title. The cell corresponding to the title is represented by the th element, as the text provides the title, because it must also provide the title to the table.

- The header cell is located at the far left or top.
- To distinguish the title from the content, the text in the header cell is expressed in bold typeface and center alignment.

The scope property specifies the range of header cells.

- `scope=`row`: Header cells are applied to horizontal rows.

### TD Elements

The td element displays the table data cell of the table. A data cell is a fundamental component of creating a table structure as a space containing data.

The colspan property specifies the column span of the column. This means merging cells horizontally, where the merging range is determined by the number of cells.

```html
<table border="1">
<tests</captions>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">셀 1-2</td>
<td>cell 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cell 4</td>
<td>cell 5</td>
<td>cell 6</td>
</tr>
</table>

```

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/21675A3D5544617809)

The rowspan property specifies the merge range (row span) of the horizontal row (row). This means merging cells in a longitudinal direction, with the merging range determined by the number of cells.

```html
<table border="1">
<tests</captions>
<tr>
<td rowspan="2">셀 1-4</td>
<td>cell 2</td>
<td>cell 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>cell 5</td>
<td>cell 6</td>
</tr>
</table>

```

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2175E736554461E831)

The header attribute specifies the header cell associated with the data cell. Since screenleader users cannot visually process tables, it is very difficult for tables of complex structures to read table information while connecting header cells and data cells one by one. In this case, the id attribute of the header cell, the header attribute of the data cell, allows the exact connection between the header cell and the data cell.

```html
<table border="1">
<tests</captions>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2">구분</th>
<th colspan="2" scope="colgroup" id="first">1학년</th>
<th colspan="2" scope="colgroup" id="second">2학년</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="col" id="hong">홍길동</th>
<th scope="col" id="jeon">전지현</th>
<th scope="col" id="kim">김철수</th>
<th scope="col" id="song">송혜교</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row" id="mandatory">전공필수</th>
<td headers="first hong mandatory">100</td>
<td headers="first jeon mandatory">90</td>
<td headers="second kim mandatory">80</td>
<td headers="second song mandatory">70</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row" id="optional">전공선택</th>
<td headers="first hong optional">60</td>
<td headers="first jeon optional">50</td>
<td headers="second kim optional">40</td>
<td headers="second song optional">30</td>
</tr>
</table>

```

### COLGROUP Element

The colgroup element displays a column group (COLUMN GROUP). A column is a vertical row, which, when grouped into one group, becomes a group of columns. This element must be written immediately after the CAPTION element and is used primarily to style column groups.

```html
<table border="1">
<captions>Interim report cards</captions>
<colgroup span="2" style="background-color:aqua">
</colgroup>
<colgroup span="2" style="background-color:beige">
</colgroup>
<tr>
<th scope="col">이름</th>
<th scope="col">학과</th>
<th scope="col">점수</th>
<th scope="col">등급</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">홍길동</th>
<td>Management Department</td>
<td>90</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">전지현</th>
<td>English Department</td>
<td>80</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">김철수</th>
<td>Architecture Department</td>
<td>70</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
</table>

```

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/221CEA36554462DC22)

### COL Element

col The element displays a table column (column below). Just as applying styles to a row in batches using tr elements, the use of col elements helps to increase work efficiency because styles can be applied in batches even by heat basis.

```html
<table border="1">
<captions>Interim report cards</captions>
<colgroup span="2" style="background-color:aqua">
<col style="background-color:greenyellow">
<col span="3">
</colgroup>
<tr>
<th scope="col">이름</th>
<th scope="col">학과</th>
<th scope="col">점수</th>
<th scope="col">등급</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">홍길동</th>
<td>Management Department</td>
<td>90</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">전지현</th>
<td>English Department</td>
<td>80</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">김철수</th>
<td>Architecture Department</td>
<td>70</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
</table>

```

### THEAD ELEMENTS

The thead element displays the Table HEADer group. Like documents, tables can be grouped into headers, body, and putters. These elements are denoted by the add, tbody, and tfoot elements, where the grouping target is a table row.

If the col element binds columns, then the add, tbody, and tfoot elements bind rows. The grouping of rows is to inform the browser of structural information about the table, which allows the browser to render tables in groups.

- The ad element usually consists of one row, but sometimes two or three rows can be table headers.
- When a table is too long and printed in several chapters, only the first chapter outputs the table header, and if you want to print the table header in each chapter, you need to use the add element.
- You can have only one thead element per table.

### TFOOT Element

The tfoot element displays the Table FOOTer group.

- Unlike the document model, the table putter must be rendered before the table body, so the tfoot element is written before the tbody element. The output order is the order of the tbody and tfoot elements.

```html
<table border="1">
<captions>Interim report cards</captions>

<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col">이름</th>
<th scope="col">학과</th>
<th scope="col">점수</th>

<td>C</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

```

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/262C323D5544698602)

### TBODY Element

The tbody element displays the Table BODY group.

There are three main reasons why rows should be grouped with tbody elements.

- Too much data on the table body often results in the need to represent the table across two to three documents, which can result in table headers, body, and putters being divided into different documents. Table data must be read comparing headers and putters, so it is very important that table headers, bodies, and putters are organized in the same document. In this case, using the tbody element can only make the table body scrollable.
- Use the tbody element when specifying row groups, such as the colgroup element. The ad and tfoot elements can only be specified once, but tbody can be specified multiple times, so styles can be applied per row group.
- A table in a complex configuration can also have a table header cell in the middle of the table. In this case, it is necessary to use the tbody element to limit the range of the th element to the table body.
