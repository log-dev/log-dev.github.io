There is a plug-in that sorts the code in a good way. Although it takes up a lot of space, we can revert when we issue it for production!

### Alignment Introduction

It helps to easily align multiple choice regions and multiple lines.

- Insert a space (space) or tab to fit multiple choices in the same column.
- Align all lines with the same indentation level in the selected area in multiple lines.
- Sort by the first `=` of each row selected over multiple lines in the same column.

### Install Alignment

- After executing the sublime text, command Palette is recalled with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P.
- Select Package Control: Install Package, which is automatically completed when `install` is entered, and press Enter.
- Enter `alig` to select the alignment when it is found, and then press Enter to install it.

### How to Use Alignment

Select the desired region, arrange Ctrl+Alt+A on Windows and Linux, and Cmd+Ctrl+A on OS X.
