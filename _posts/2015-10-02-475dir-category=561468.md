It`s about fragmentation of Android browsers. The original is THE ANDROID BROWSER.

### Preface

Do you think browser testing on the desktop is difficult? If you test your browser on an Android device, you`ll experience hell.

All browsers work differently, which renders different results. Android has many browsers, and even the same browser has many changes.

### WebView

Android is also loaded with WebKit-based web views. Most browsers, including default browsers, use Webview.

The webview will be updated to meet the major Android update schedule (2→3→4). However, it also provides bugfixes with minor updates to Android.

Also, Android 4 devices are typically loaded with Google Chrome. Depending on the device used, Google Chrome may be the default browser, an extra browser, only Chrome may exist, or may not exist.

Android 4.4 loaded a new webview based on Chromeium 30. However, it is different from Google Chrome.

Chromeium-based webviews are regularly updated (Android 4.4.3 is Chrome 33 and Android 5 is Chrome 37). In fact, Android 5`s webview can be updated individually, regardless of OS.

### Improved Web View

The existing (old) web view was not very good. Device manufacturers have improved their web views. So we came to the reality that we could no longer have one webview for each version of Android. This has diversified into a situation where Samsung has one, HTC has one, and other manufacturers have one of their own web views.

Did SONY ERICSON know that it used a browser that embed WEBGL running on Android 2.3?

These web views may provide better standard support, but they also have other bugs at the same time. Sometimes webviews have activated the functionality of webkits under development. Just to say that HTML5 support is higher than other browsers...

### Samsung Browser

Samsung Electronics has loaded upgraded webviews on Galaxy S3. This has been updated several times.

The Galaxy S4 used the same webkit-based webview. However, Samsung browsers no longer use Webview. The browser for the Samsung Galaxy S4 is based on Chromeium 18. It was subsequently updated to Chrome 28. However, it is different from Google Chrome.

The Galaxy Trend 3 was announced six months later and still uses a webkit-based browser.

The browser for the Galaxy Note 3 is also based on Chrome 28. It is almost the same as Galaxy 4. It`s almost...

Samsung devices used different browsers, running on the same version of Android.

### HTC Browser

HTC was also loaded with modified web views. It is a different revision from Samsung. They improved versions of each new Android, and continued until version 4.3.

HTC devices and Android 4.4 have a new Chromeium webview.

In Android 4.4, HTC SENSE browsers still use modifications to the webview of Android 4.3.

### Fire OS

Fire OS is used for Amazon Kindle Fire and Amazon Fire Phone.

Kindle Fire loaded the default Android webview (1st Generation -> Android 2.3, 2nd Generation -> Android 4.0, 3rd Generation -> Android 4.2).

The default browser for Fire OS is called Silk. Silk is webkit-based and currently Chromeium 31-based. However, it is different from Google Chrome.

The 2nd and 3rd generation Kindle Fire loaded a second webview as an option, an Amazon Webview based on Chrome 25. However, it is different from Google Chrome, and it is also different from silk. It is also different from the Android 4.4 Chromeium webview.

Fire Phone, which will be released soon, also uses Amazon Webview as its basis.

### Nokia X

The Nokia X platform is Android-based and loaded with web-kit-based webviews. Nokia X, Nokia X+ and XL are Android 4.1 and Nokia X2 is Android 4.3.

The Nokia browser is based on Chromeium 27. This was quickly updated to Chrome 30. However, it is different from Google Chrome.

Along with the Nokia X2 announcement, it was replaced by Opera, another Chromeium-based browser. Microsoft has canceled future plans for the Nokia X platform.

### conclusion

There is no such thing as an Android browser. Like a webkit isn`t one, like a chromium isn`t one... I want to say, "Use a Chrome browser to unify this." However, it is questionable whether this will improve just like the desktop situation.
