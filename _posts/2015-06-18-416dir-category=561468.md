Maybe it`s a strange word. I keep getting confused with certain words. While writing web documents, changes in elements may be noticeable and the flickering of the screen may be annoying. We`re going to cover this.

### What is FOUC?

Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) is a phenomenon in which when a web document is accessed through a browser, the screen flashes that occur when the CSS style is not fully applied, and the screen changes to exposed before and after the style is applied. This phenomenon is particularly evident in Internet Explorer (IE) browsers, and is still a problem that occurs in the latest IE11. This is a factor that reduces the user experience of the web document.

FOUC was first written in 2001 under the name Flash of Unstyled Content, a problem that occurred only in IE. Next, a flaw was found in the Safari browser in 2006, and the article was written under the name "The FOUC Problem". Recently, FOUC has been found in many ways because it is also styled using JS or jQuery.

> In personal experience, this phenomenon has been observed throughout the browser. This, unlike in the past, faces unexpected screen flickering to draw and write many resources today.

### FOUC Cause

The main cause of FOUC occurrence is related to how browsers behave.

- The browser collects all incidental files referenced in the markup and creates a Document Object Model (DOM) immediately.
- Display the content of the fastest-analyzed article on the screen
- Apply styles and execute scripts according to the order of the declared markup of what is displayed on the screen.

Recent web documents refer to multiple CSS files and change the DOM structure, which is more frequent.

- Web documents often include style references to media other than browser screens as CSS rules for printers and wireless devices.
- Web documents can import style files to @import and refer to other CSSs.
- Online advertising and content inserted elsewhere, such as video and search engines, often dictates its own style rules within code blocks.
- After all the web documents are loaded, the DOM structure is changed using JavaScript.

Most of all, in the case of webfont, which has been widely used recently, the IE browser also triggers FOUC, providing a very distracting and unbeautiful experience.

### Test by Browser

This is a test result using a browser for Windows.

Chrome, Firefox, and Opera do not display on the screen until the referenced style is applied, but in IE, the style is applied exposed to the screen, causing FOUC. For safaris, the browser for Windows is no longer supported, so it is omitted.

When changing the DOM structure using JavaScript, most browsers change the content to exposed on the screen, causing FOUC.

### FOUC Solutions

- In order to minimize FOUC, CSS should be linked to the `head` element by default, and @import should be avoided.
- It can be overcome by changing the order of declaration and location of JavaScript. (For performance, JavaScript is placed in front of `</body>` element, but it is changed to `head`)
- It hides the FOUC-causing zone and shows it when all the styles or scripts of the document are applied.

The methods for hiding and re-showing FOUC-causing zones are described below.

```html
<html class="no-js">
<head>
<style>
.js #fouc {display: none}
</style>
<script>
(function(H){H.className=H.className.replace(/\bno-js\b/,'js')})(document.documentElement)
</script>
</head>

<body>
<div id="fouc">
...
</div> <!-- /#fouc -->

<script>
document.getElementById("fouc").style.display="block";
</script>
</body>
</html>

```

Add `.no-js` to html tag and style and JavaScript to head tag. The corresponding JavaScript is class of the html tag if the browser`s JavaScript is enabled.Change to js`. Added fouc as the ID value to the area to be hidden.

If you specify an area surrounding the entire page as shown above, you will show an empty page and then show the page when all resources are loaded.

> In IE, the FOUC for webfonts is particularly annoying, so I use browser sniping to pick out IE and process them with FOUC. Also, instead of showing empty pages when they are hidden, it can be a way to put a mark or image that says it is loading.
