What is CSS?

Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a language that describes how the markup language is actually displayed, and is mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and is also available in XML.

Standard for W3C, with a high degree of freedom when defining layouts and styles.

### Why CSS?

- It is possible to separate the clarity structure and the expressive aspects.
- It can be more accessible from various devices.
- It`s easy to modify many revisions to the website more quickly (just one CSS file, not all pages).
Of course, CSS files are divided into content characteristics, but even if there are multiple pages, they have a common style (design), so if you just modify those CSS files, it`s easy to work with.
- It is also good for code readability, performance optimization, and for users to customize their designs to their liking.
- It is also beneficial in terms of maintenance for those who run the site.

### CSS Properties and Categorization

CSS has the following properties and is recommended to declare them in order of layout (batch) and associated properties:

| |
| |
| |
| |
| |

### CSS Property Order

In terms of readability, we recommend that you write the above attributes from a large blur to a small flow.

There may be several large flows, but CSS is a visual representation, so it`s about whether the most important thing is to be seen or hidden.

So if any of the properties that need to be declared are `display`, we first define the `display` property and sequentially write the properties that are normally required for layout.

It is then common to write in a flow of attribute values (usually attributes that are a little far from the layout) for detailed control of multiple people.

In fact, we don`t always follow the order above, but it doesn`t matter if the order changes a little.

However, if the above properties are roughly observed within a large framework as well as between maintenance workers, you can quickly find where and what CSS properties are defined from the perspective of modifiers.

For this reason, keeping the properties in order can increase the readability of the code.

### Inheritance

Inheritance refers to the style declared on the parent node affecting even the child node.

In other words, the CSS style declared in `h1` will be inherited to the child node `span`.

Let`s check with the code.

```undefined
<h1>CSS
<span>Inheritance</span>
</h1> 
```

```css
h1 { /* type selector */
color: red;
}
```

Some properties of CSS have non-inherited limits.

In common sense, when I declared a border to my parents, they could have a border on my child.

And if the parent`s font color is inherited equally from where the `a` link is used, the `a` link will be insufficient for the user and UI/UX.

Of course, assuming that it is inherited in the same color, you might think that this is the text that acts as a link, but from the point of view of designing CSS, it is designed not to allow inheritance in order to make the role as a link.

And the box model properties are not inherited.

This is because there are no cases where `margin` and `padding` are usually inherited as child elements.

### Cascade

If the same property declaration overlaps, the declared property is applied later.

```css
h1 {
color: red;
}
h1 {
color:blue;
}
```

### selector

The selector is the core of the CSS.

Without a selector, there is no way to style, so you should have specified properties for each element.

You can style a whole element, or a specific group, so you can style many elements with just a few lines of CSS.

There are three main categories of selectors:

- `Type Selector` : [h1, div, span, em] 구체성(0, 0, 0, 1)
- `Class Selector` : [.aside, .section] specificity (0, 0, 1, 0)
- `ID Selector` : [#content, #footer] 구체성(0, 1, 0, 0)

```css
#wrap { ... }
#wrap .header { ... }
.content div ul.noti li { ... }
```

There are many other types of virtual selectors.

### specificity, specificity, and specificity

The CSS style is applied by the specificity of the weight defined in the W3CSS 2.1 specification.

Explicitness is a numerical representation of how explicit the selector is?

There are three criteria to determine the specificity of the selector.

The numbers above and commas are the criteria.

There is a comma between the numbers, which is independent of each level of granularity.

This is because having one class descriptor defined may be more explicit than having multiple element (type) selectors.

Also, if you don`t separate it with commas and convert it to 0013 score, you need to be careful because there is a misunderstanding that can be understood as 13 points.

If the specificity is 0,0,1,0 and 0,0,0,0 and 11 specifications are misunderstood as 10,11, so you can misunderstand that the specifications are higher.

```undefined
'<h2>Heading element
<span>Explicit Test (0,0,0,2)</span>
</h2>

£h4 class="c_type">class specifications are:
<span class="c_type2">0,0,2,2 입니다.</span>
</h4>
```

```css
h2 {
color: red; /* 0,0,0,1 */
}
h2 span {
color: green; /* 0,0,0,2 */
}
h4.c_type { /* 0,0,1,1 */
color: gray;
}
h4.c_type span.c_type2 { /* 0,0,2,2 */
color: pink;
}
#content {
color: black;
}

div ul ul li {
/* Element descriptor 0,0,0,4 */
}

div.aside ul li {
/* One class and three elements, so 0,0,1,3 */
}

a:hover {
/* One virtual class and one element 0,0,1,2 */
}

div.nav a:hover {
/* One virtual class, one class, and two elements, 0,0,2,2 */
}

#content em {
/* Since you have 1 ID selector and 1 element selector 0,1,0,1 */
}
div#content em {
/* 1 ID selector and 2 elements 0,1,0,2 */
}
```

In addition, zero at the beginning of the explicit plot indicates an inline style.

### Definitely : !important

There is something that takes precedence over the specificity that has been described so far.There is `important`.

In JavaScript, you may understand that `!(operator)` is not important because it is an operator that means negation, but it is not in CSS.

```undefined
<div id="demo">
<p id="demo-child" style="color:tan">Lorem ipsum dolor sit.</p>
</div>
```

```css
div#demo p#demo-child {
color: red /*!important*/; /* 0,2,0,2 */
}
div p {
color: green !important; /* 1,0,0,2 */
} 
```

By default, a declaration with a critical mark will override any declaration without a critical mark.

Although it is more specific because there are two ID selectors, the priority is `!Because it was lost to the `important`, the impotant is called the Joker of the card.

But both of them said, "!What if `important` is declared?

Because both declarations have Joker declared, they are on an equal level, so general cabling rules apply.

That is, the specifications apply.

Therefore, `!important` should be used carefully. If you start abusing it, you`ll almost end up in an impact black hole, and you`ll hear a lot of abuse from the maintenance and the back-up workers.

Please use it carefully.

### Pseudo class, Element

There are two virtual concepts in CSS.

Virtual classes, virtual elements.

The following virtual classes are supported by CSS 2.1:

- `:link` - Unvisited Link
- `:visited` - Link to visit
- `:hover` - element with focus
- `:active` - Active elements (the very link to the moment you click on the link)
- `:first-child` The first child of the selected element

There are many other virtual classes, but the above items are mainly used.

Next is the CSS2.1 virtual element.

- `::first-letter`
- `::before`
- `::after`

What is the difference between a virtual class and a virtual element?

This has a different effect on the document.

Virtual classes behave as if you added a class to a document, and virtual elements have the same effect as adding elements to a document.

```css
.demo01:before {
content: "";
display: block;
height: 5px;
border: 1px solid red;
}
ul li:first-child {
color:blue;
}
```

It is called a virtual element because it has been added as if it were just real.

Similarly, a virtual class behaves as if it had been added to an element within a document.

The following virtual classes have been added to CSS3, but the support rate is not high yet:

- `:target`
- `:root`
- `:nth-of-type()`
- `:nth-child()`
- `:first-of-type`
- `:last-of-type`
- `:last-child`
- `:empty`, `:not()`

### CSS Style Declaration Method

There are three ways to declare a CSS: to create one.

External style, internal style, and inline style.

- The most recommended and common way to manage CSS files separately.

```undefined
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"/>
</head> 
```

- Used when the CSS portion of a single page is low in internal style

```undefined
<head>
<style type="text/css">
#demo { border:1px solid red; }
</style>
</head> 
```

- Use when property values need to be changed dynamically

```undefined
<div style="display:block">블라블라..</div>
```

### CSS Hack(핵)

Sometimes all CSS style properties are not rendered equally because each browser has a slight difference in rendering method and bugs exist.(If design doesn`t work out the way I want in IE7 and 8 only)

Therefore, the technique of excluding a particular browser or applying CSS only in a particular browser and depending on the version is called the CSS hack.

Because it is difficult to use, it is often not grammatically correct and non-standard, so you should refrain from using it unless it is inevitable.

In most cases, some of the nuclei, a CSS technique for ensuring browser backward compatibility and inter-browser rendering compatibility, do not conform to the CSS standard grammar.

Although it is an inevitable means of maintaining browser vendor-specific and version-specific compatibility, reckless use of nuclei can result in increased code volume, performance degradation, increased maintenance and increased code complexity.

For the above reasons, it is recommended not to use nuclear weapons as much as possible, but to minimize them only if they are inevitable.

### Semantic Markup

Semantic markups are a prerequisite for maintaining interchangeable browsers.

CSS Formatting can only be correct if HTML code composition that matches valid grammar and meaning is assumed.
