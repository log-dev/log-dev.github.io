Ubuntu`s basic storage is connected to KAIST server in Korea, but it is frustratingly slow, so I change it to the next storage.

### Use the following storage

First, open the file as below.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list

```

Change it at once using the replacement function of vi.

```undefined
:%s/kr.archive.ubuntu.com/ftp.daum.net/g

```

Other repositories can be changed as shown below.

```undefined
:%s/security.ubuntu.com/ftp.daum.net/g
:%s/extras.ubuntu.com/ftp.daum.net/g

```

Run updates and upgrades.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

```
