### CONTENTEDITABLE 속성

The contentable property allows users to edit the content of specified elements. It can also reflect modifications made to areas of content that can be selected and edited.

```html
Fix it in the <p contentable="true"> browser!</p>

```

- Specifying this property affects all elements in the child.
- The DOM property is described as contentEditable and iscontentEditable to verify that the element is editable.
- It can be designated as `document.designMode=`on` using JavaScript to make the entire document editable.
- Since changes made by users after editing are applied to DOM, the edited area`s inner HTML (full document if editable in designMode) can be sent to the server for storage and application.

Specifying this property affects all elements in the child.

### CONTEXTMENU Properties

The context menu property is a property added in HTML5 that defines a context menu. These are the menus that come out when you click the right mouse.

```html
<p contextmenu="supermenu">This paragraph has a context menu called "supermenu" attached.</p>

<menu id="supermenu">
<command label="Step 1: Write Tutorial" onclick="doSomething()">
<command label="Step 2: Edit Tutorial" onclick="doSomethingElse()">
</menu>

```

The browsers do not support it yet.

### DATA-*

The data-* property is a property added to HTML5, which allows information to be passed from markup to scripts. Any element can contain any property, so it does not have to go through existing complex steps.

```html
<div id="cat_1" data-id="1" data-name="나비">
...
</div>

```

The value of the dataset property is a simple string map (a sequence of associations), but the prefix of the attribute name `data-` can be omitted when reading and writing the value.

It shall be specified including the prefix `data-`.

```js
var row = document.getElementById("cat_1");
Add a custom data property named row.dataset.age = "3"; //age
alert (row.dataset.id); add custom data property called //id
alert(row.getAttribute("data-id"); //getAttribute() requires prefix
delete row.dataset.age; //data-age 속성 삭제

```

When creating a pop-up window, the onclick event is often used for element a. This prevents separation of actions and content, which wastes time on repetitive tasks if the same task is done against multiple links, and HTML becomes larger than necessary.

```html
"<!-- pop-up with onclick -->
< a href="#" onclick="window.open('help/holiday_pay.html', WinName, 'width=300,height=300');">공휴일 급여 정책</a>

<!-- Improved accessibility-->
< a href="help/holiday_pay.html" onclick="window.open('this.href', WinName, 'width=300,height=300');">공휴일 급여 정책</a>

```

To improve this, we remove onclick events and give each link a class to describe.

```html
<a href="help/holiday_pay.html" class="popup">공휴일 급여 정책</a>

```

Using the jQuery selector, select the entire element a with a popup class and then put a handler on the click event for each element. This code is passed to the click method of each element, which is executed when the user clicks the link. The `preventDefault` method prevents the default behavior of events, where the browser follows a link and prevents the page from being opened.

```js
var links = $("a.popup");

links.click(function(event) {
event.preventDefault();
window.open($(this).attr("href"));
});

```

Custom data is used to control the size of pop-up windows.

```html
"<a href="help/holiday_pay.html" data-width="600" data-height="400" title="Opening a new window of public holiday pay policy" class="popup">public holiday pay policy</a>

```

click Modify event handler to take out the information stored in the custom data properties and pass it to the window.open() method.

```js
$(function() {
$(".popup").click(function(event) {
event.preventDefault();
var href = $(this).attr("href"),
width = $(this).attr("data-width"),
height = $(thhis).attr("data-height),
popup = window.open(href, "popup", "height=" + height + ",width=" + width + "");
});
});

```

### DRAGGABLE PROPERTIES

The draggable property is a newly added property in HTML5, and elements containing this property can be dragged using the drag-and-drop API.

```html
<div draggable="true">
This element is dragable.
</div>

```

- Links and images are basically dragable.
- `draggable="true": Elements with this attribute can be dragged and dropped.
- `draggable=`false`: Elements with this attribute cannot be dragged and dropped.
- `draggable="auto" : The element with this attribute follows the browser`s settings.

Let`s drag the box below.

### DROPZONE

The dropzone property is a newly added property in HTML5, which is copied, moved, and linked when dragging data is dropped.

```html
<div dropzone="copy"></div>

```

- `dropzone=`: Droping an item into an element means copying the dragged data. If the value is not specified, it is considered copy.
- `dropzone="move" : Droping an item into an element means moving the dragged data.
- `dropzone="link": Droping an item to an element means linking to the original data.

The browsers do not support it yet.

### HIDDEN

The hidden property is a newly added property in HTML5, which, unlike the hidden in css, is never exposed to browsers.

```html
<div id="main" hidden>
...
</div>

```

### SPELLCHECK

The spellcheck property is a newly added property in HTML5, which is a red underscore when a user enters the wrong text in a form that receives text input.

```html
<textarea spellcheck="true"></textarea>

```

- `spellcheck="true" : check spelling and grammar.
- `spellcheck="false": Do not check spelling and grammar.

Unfortunately, only English words or sentences are applicable.

### TRANSLATE

The translate property is a newly added property in HTML5, which sets whether the content of the specified element is translated or not.

```html
<p translate="no">Don't translate this!</p>
<p>This can be translated to any language.</p>

```

- `translate="yes": Translate the contents of the specified element.
- `translate="no" : does not translate the contents of the specified element.
