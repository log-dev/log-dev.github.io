Immediate Run Function Pattern

### IIFE(immediately-invoked function expression)

These days, I`ve been asked a lot about the format of immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) as below.

```js
(function (window, document, undefined) {
//
})(window, document);
```

So I`ll post something related to this.

I`m going to cover various contents together in this posting. Let`s take a look at it one by one.

Scope

JavaScript has a function scope, which allows you to have a private scope.

For example:

```js
(function (window, document, undefined) {
var name = 'Todd';
})(window, document);
console.log(name); // name is not defined, it's in a different scope
```

Simple. (Reverse: In the code above, name has a valid scope only within the function.)

How it works

Normal function expressions look like below.

(Reverse frequently: Function expressions are interpreted by the JavaScript engine`s parser as execution code and have execution-based results or exist as values assigned to a particular variable.)

```js
var logMyName = function (name) {
console.log(name);
};

logMyName('Todd');
```

Through the function expression above, we can call the function at any time we want. Also, we can provide the scope we want anywhere.

The reason why "IIFE" is wrapped in () is because it is an out-of-the-box function expression.

These functions are called immediately at runtime and we cannot recall them again after one run.

```js
var logMyName = (function (name) {
console.log(name); // Todd
})('Todd');
```

In the example above, look at the code shape that you assigned to the logMyName variable.

```js
(function () {

})();
```

It doesn`t work if one parenthesis pair is missing like the code below.

(Reverse: Because the parser on the JavaScript engine recognizes the function keyword as a function declaration when it first appears.)

```js
function () {

}();
```

However, there are some tricks in JavaScript to force code like this to work.

This method allows the parser of the JavaScript engine to be in front of the code:!`It`s a way to see a character and recognize it as an expression rather than a function declaration.

```js
!function () {

}();
```

Likewise, there are similar variations as below.

```js
function () {

}();
-function () {

}();
~function () {

}();
```

But I don`t use this method.

Check out @mariuschulz`s Disassembling JavaScript`s IIFE Syntax to learn more about IIFE grammar and its variations.

Arguments

Now we know how IIFE works.

Of course, you can also forward the arguments to IIFE.

```js
(function (window) {
})(window);
```

How does this code work?

The function runs through the last part of the window; and at this point, we hand over the window object.

The objects that are handed over are defined by the name window, even within the function.

You can ask if the parameter name window is meaningless and can be defined as a different name. However, try to use the name window well.

So what should we do? Let`s turn over the document object.

```js
(function (window, document) {
// we refer to window and document normally
})(window, document);
```

Regional variables can be interpreted faster than global variables.

But unless it`s a code of a huge scale, we can`t feel a noticeable speedup.

Still, if you refer to many global variables, it`s worth considering.

What about undefined?

ECMAScript 3 states that undefied is mutable.

This means that you can reassign values, such as undefiend = true;.

Amazing, huh? Thankfully, using ECMAScript 5`s strict mode ``user strict;`` the parser spits out the error.

But before that, we have to protect IIFE by ourselves like the code below.

```js
(function (window, document, undefined) {
})(window, document);
```

If you do this, there is no problem even if someone makes a mistake like below.

Because the third factor is not passed by IIFE argument, the undefined in the function scope works as an actual undefined meaning.

```js
undefined = true;
(function (window, document, undefined) {
// undefined is a local undefined variable
})(window, document);
```

Minifying

If local variables pass in the function, the variable name itself is not important and we can call it with the new name we want.

The code below goes through minifying.

```js
(function (window, document, undefined) {
console.log(window); // Object window
})(window, document);
```

It changes to the code below.

```js
(function (a, b, c) {
console.log(a); // Object window
})(window, document);
```

Imagine the libraries, windows, and document objects that you refer to are nicely minified.

In addition, jQuery objects can also be delivered in $ form, and anything can be delivered within an optical scope.

```js
(function ($, window, document, undefined) {
// use $ to refer to jQuery
// $(document).addClass('test');
})(jQuery, window, document);
(function (a, b, c, d) {
// becomes
// a(c).addClass('test');
})(jQuery, window, document);
```

This means that we don`t need to call `jQuery.noConflict();` and we can use it by assigning jQuery to $ as a local module.

It would be more helpful to study JavaScript scopes and global/local variables.

If you are a minifier with good performance, you will search the undefined word in your code and replace it with a name like `c`.

Here, the name undefined itself is not much related to the replacement.

What we need to know is that the object we refer to is undefined, and it doesn`t mean anything special.

undefined is a type of data provided by JavaScript that means it has been declared, but has never been assigned a value. (Reverse: this part seems to mean that minifier does not simply view and replace undefined names, but takes reference relationships into account.)

Non-browser global environments

Because of tools like Node.js, browsers are not always global objects.

If you need to work with multiple environments, you might be concerned about creating IIFE because the browser is not always a global object.

Therefore, I have a habit of creating IIFE code forms based on the below appearance.

```js
(function (root) {

})(this);
```

In a browser, the global environment (global object) is referenced to a window object, so you don`t have to turn the window over, and this allows you to simply turn it over.

I prefer the name root because it can be referenced by root not only in the browser but also in the browser environment.

If you`re interested in universal solutions (I always use this approach when creating open source projects), there`s a `UMD wrapper` approach below.

```js
(function (root, factory) {
if (typeof define === 'function'
```

This is a very sophisticated method.

Function crossed to argument is being called as factory function.

In this way, we can properly allocate externally depending on the environment.

In the browser, you can assign our IIFE module by root.MYMODULE = factory(); in Node.js, you can assign our IIFE module by module.exports by type of definition === `function`

The details related to this are a little different, but I recommend you to check the UMD repo as well.
