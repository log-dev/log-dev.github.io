Namespace Pattern

Many libraries are coming out to improve the reuse and productivity of JavaScript code. The most important thing in producing these libraries is the use of namespaces to ensure independence from other modules and to avoid interference.

When you use a library, the type name used on one side may be used on the other at any time, and if you are creating a library that you don`t know where it will be used, it is essential that you define a namespace to safely separate and manage objects.

Namespaces reduce the number of global variables required by the program, while preventing names from overlapping without using excessive prefixes.

Instead of disrupting the global effective range with numerous functions, objects, and variables, you can create one global object for an application or library (ideally creating only one) and add all the features to it.

If you look at the code above, you can see that there are five global variables.

These codes are undesirable anti-patterns because they disturb the global scope.

To refactivate the above code, we first generate a global object dedicated to the application, then MYAPP.

All functions and variables are then changed to the property of this global object.

As shown in the code above, the global scope has only one global variable.

The name of the global namespace object can be selected from the name of the application, the name of the library, the domain name, or the company name.

### Universal namespace function

As the complexity of the program increases and each part of the code is separated into separate files and optionally included in the document, it is dangerous to assume that a code is the first to define a particular namespace or its internal property. The property you are trying to add to the namespace may already exist and therefore overwrite the content.

Therefore, it is best to determine whether it already exists before creating a namespace or adding a property.

This ability to determine the existence of namespaces and their properties can result in large amounts of duplicate code.

Thus, creating a reusable function that is responsible for the actual task of namespace generation increases the reuse of code.

The following example implements a namespace function.

The following methods do not break existing code because namespaces do not overwrite them when they exist.

This code can be used as follows:
