Among the form fields, the most difficult to design is the select box. Let`s find out the reality of this and find alternative measures.

### Status of Select Design

Due to the design limitations of the native select box, many plugins replace the structure of the select box with div and ul elements. Of course, there is a lack of support for older versions of IE, as most recent plug-ins do.

However, the jQuery Selectbox plugin developed a long time ago supports older IE. It would be easy to modify the CSS of this plugin to build the design you want.

However, such methods of replacing select boxes with div and ul elements will not be able to receive the effect that each device supports natively on mobile. If you encounter a select box that contains many options on a small mobile device, you will experience a very unpleasant user experience.

Native select behavior

Below you will learn about the design using CSS and simple JavaScript without plug-ins.

### Modify Select CSS directly

It will be a future story due to domestic circumstances, but in modern browsers, it is possible to change the appearance of the select boxes to some extent. The first thing to do is to remove the arrow shapes that each browser supports natively and unify them into one.

The basic structure of select box is as follows.

```html
<select>
<select box</option>
<option>옵션1</option>
<option>옵션2</option>
<option>옵션3</option>
</select>

```

The style of removing arrow shapes and adding new arrows is shown below.

```css
select {
-webkit-appearance: none; /* Hide native appearance */
-moz-appearance: none;
appearance: none;
background: url (image path) no-repeat 95% 50%; /* arrow-shaped image */
}

/* Hide native arrows on IE 10, 11 */
select::-ms-expand {
display: none;
}

```

Afterwards, the design of the select box is changed to suit your taste. Of course, only select box type can be changed, and option side cannot be changed. If you want to change to the option side, it is recommended to use plug-in related to select box.

```css
select {
width: 200px; /* set width desired */
padding: .8em.5em; /* set height to margin */
font-family: inherit; /* font inheritance */
background: url (https://farm1.staticflickr.com/379/19928272501_4ef877c265_t.jpg) no-repeat 95% 50%; /* Replace native arrow */
border: 1px solid #999;
Border-radius: 0px; /* Remove iOS Round Edge */
-webkit-appearance: none; /* Hide native appearance */
-moz-appearance: none;
appearance: none;
}

```

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="192" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/uzugoer/embed/yNxRKE?user=uzugoer&amp;default-tab=result&amp;slug-hash=yNxRKE&amp;theme-id=17120&amp;height=192&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_yNxRKE"></iframe>

### Design change using label

It is a design method using the label element and the parent element enclosing the select box as the method used in the form field (input type="text") design #1.

The basic structure is shown below, and the parent and label elements surrounding the select elements are added.

```html
<div class="selectbox">
<label for="ex_select">국적선택</label>
<select id="ex_select">
<option selected>Select nationality</option>
<option>한국</option>
<option>일본</option>
<option>중국</option>
</select>
</div>

```

- Specify the ID value of the select element and the for property of the label element as the same value (for interaction).
- Match the text of the label element with the selected property among the option elements.

CSS is as follows.

```css
.selectbox {
position: relative;
width: 200px; /* set width */
Border: 1px solid #999; /* Set border */
z-index: 1;
}

.selectbox:before { /* replace arrow */
content: "";
position: absolute;
top: 50%;
right: 15px;
width: 0;
height: 0;
margin-top: -1px;
border-left: 5px solid transparent;
border-right: 5px solid transparent;
border-top: 5px solid #333;
}

.selectbox label {
position: absolute;
top: 1px; /* position alignment */
left: 5px; /* position alignment */
padding: .8em.5em; /* select by margin */
color: #999;
z-index: -1; /* Resolve where label is located in IE8 */
}

.selectbox select {
width: 100%;
height: auto; /* initialize height */
line-height: normal; /* line-height 초기화 */
font-family: inherit; /* font inheritance */
padding: .8em.5em; /* determine margin and height */
border: 0;
opacity: 0; /* Hide */
filter:alpha(opacity=0); /* IE8 숨기기 */
-webkit-appearance: none; /* Hide native appearance */
-moz-appearance: none;
appearance: none;
}

```

- `.selectbox` is actually in charge of appearance. Let`s design this part in the shape we want.
- The `.selectbox:before` part replaces the arrow, but the background you want.It is okay to set it on `selectbox` and delete it.

When something is selected in the select box, the text that the option has is reflected in the label to implement functions such as how the real select element works.

```js
$(document).ready(function() {
var selectTarget = $('.selectbox select');

selectTarget.change(function(){
var select_name = $(this).children('option:selected').text();
$(this).siblings('label').text(select_name);
});
});


```

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="178" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/uzugoer/embed/jPvXGq?user=uzugoer&amp;default-tab=result&amp;slug-hash=jPvXGq&amp;theme-id=17120&amp;height=178&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_jPvXGq"></iframe>

In IE7, the code above applies up to IE8 because `padding` does not apply to the select element. To support up to IE7, padding is not a select element.It is recommended that Samsung Display will change its method to apply it to selectbox`. However, at this time, the size of the select element does not change, so the area that can be clicked becomes smaller than the size of the entire box.

Another method is to specify `height` and `line-height` values of the same size in `.selectbox`, `label`, and `select` instead of using padding in the first place.

IE7 does not support :before, so it should be displayed using a background image.

```css
.selectbox {
position: relative;
width: 200px;
height: 40px;
line-height: 40px;
background: url(https://farm1.staticflickr.com/379/19928272501_4ef877c265_t.jpg) no-repeat 95% 50%;
border: 1px solid #999;
z-index: 1;
}

.selectbox label {
position: absolute;
top: 0px;
left: 5px;
height: 40px;
line-height: 40px;
color: #999;
z-index: -1;
}

.selectbox select {
width: 100%;
height: 40px;
line-height: 40px;
font-family: inherit;
border: 0;
opacity: 0;
filter:alpha(opacity=0);
-webkit-appearance: none; /* Hide native appearance */
-moz-appearance: none;
appearance: none;
}

```

A problem was found in the Android 4.4 (Kitcat) version of the Galaxy 3 stock browser (built-in browser). When CSS related to `position` is applied to the parent element and self (select element), when focus occurs, there is a phenomenon in which the screen.

> The problems with stock browsers on Android are as if they were looking at IE's older browsers. The bugs are endless. If you see people using stock browsers around you, recommend using mobile Chrome browsers.
