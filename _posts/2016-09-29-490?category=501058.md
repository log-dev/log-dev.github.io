Event object that passes over as a callback function when an event occurs

When an event occurs, a callback function that is passed as a parameter is called to the event, which passes the event object to the parameter.

The property of this `event object` contains information that can be obtained when an event occurs, a method that can control the propagation process of the event model, and a method that prevents the browser`s default behavior from occurring.

### Event Object

The following is an example of an event object crossing and using properties and methods:

```js
$('selector').on('eventType', function (event) {
event.property; // Get property value of event object
event.method(); // To invoke a method on an event object
})
```

The following table summarizes the property properties and methods of frequently used event objects.
