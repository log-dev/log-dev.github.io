It covers the CSS properties associated with fonts that are commonly called fonts. The properties required to specify fonts and adjust spacing.

### font

It is an abbreviated property that controls the system font value.

```css
object.style.font="italic small-caps bold 12px arial,sans-serif"

```

| Internet Express | Firefox | Safari | Chrome | Opera |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Support | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support | Support

The inherit value is not supported below IE7. IE8 requires !DOCTYPE. IE9 to support normally.

### font-family

Specifies the font type and the value is inherited.

```css
body { font-family :'나눔고딕', 'Malgun Gothic', sans-serif;}

```

- Identify and apply existence in the order of the specified fonts.
- It instructs the browser to select the font specified at the beginning of the font, separated by commas. If the browser does not find the font, it will sequentially find the font specified after it. At the end of the listed fonts, one of the font name constants must be specified, such as sans-serif, serif, and monospace. Font names and Korean font names containing blanks must be enclosed in quotation marks.

- Font Name : Specifies the font name.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

The inherit value is not supported below IE7. IE8 requires !DOCTYPE. IE9 to support normally.

### font-size-adjust

Attributes added to CSS3 maintain readability by maintaining the ratio between lowercase and uppercase characters and adjusting the font-size attribute value so that the x-height attribute value is fixed regardless of the font. Values are inherited.

```css
div {font-size-adjust: 0.58;}

```

- In general, the font size varies depending on the font specified in the font-family, so there is room for problems. Specifying a font size with the font-size-adjust attribute prevents this.
- The ratio between upper and lower case letters is the value of the font x-height/font size.

- nubmer (number): Specifies the ratio to be used.
- none : does not change font size to default.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.fontSizeAdjust="0.58"

```

| Internet Express | Firefox | Safari | Chrome | Opera |

| Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |

### font-stretch

The attribute added to CSS3 extends or narrows the width of characters. The property does not yet have a supported browser.

```css
div {font-stretch: expanded;}

```

- Extra-condensed: narrower than condensed, but not narrower than ultra-condensed.
- Condensed : narrower than semi-condensed, but not narrower than extra-condensed.
- semi-condensed: narrower than normal, but not narrower than condensed.
- normal : By default, do not enlarge or narrow the font.
- semi-expanded: wider than normal, but not wider than expended.
- Expanded : wider than semi-expanded, but not wider than extra-expanded.
- Extra-expanded: wider than expanded, but not wider than ultra-expanded.
- ultra-expanded: widen as much as possible.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.fontStretch="expanded"

```

| Internet Express | Firefox | Safari | Chrome | Opera |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported | Not Supported |

### font-size

Specifies the size of the font.

```css
h1 {font-size:250%;}
h2 {font-size:200%;}
p {font-size:100%;}

```

- Specify an em or percentage value to be proportional to the letter size of the parent element.
- To set a specific size, you can specify a px value, but you do not know what size it will display in the layout. This is because when users zoom in or out of a document screen, the browser increases or decreases the size of the text. In addition, IE6 creates accessibility problems because users cannot increase fixed-size characters even when they zoom in on a screen.

- xx-small : see example below
- x-small : see example below
- small : see example below
- medium : see example below
- large : see example below
- x-large : see example below
- xx-large : see example below
- smaller : see example below
- larger : see example below
- Length: Specifies the value followed by the absolute unit designator (cm, mm, in, pt, pc) or relative unit designator (em, ex, px) after the floating point number.
- %(percent) : Specifies the integer followed by the percent sign (%)
- intial : Specifies the default value.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

The inherit value is not supported below IE7. IE8 requires !DOCTYPE. IE9 to support normally.

### font-style

Specifies the shape of the font.

```css
p.normal {font-style:normal;}
p.italic {font-style:italic;}
p.oblique {font-style:oblique;}

```

- normal : default to normal font shape.
- italic : designates it as italic shape.
- oblique: Specifies the shape of the oblique.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.fontStyle="italic"

```

### font-variant

Specify the font in small capital letters.

```css
p.small {font-variant:small-caps;}

```

- Specifying text-transform:upercase with font-size:0.8em that reduces character size can have a similar effect as smallcaps (because fewer default fonts support smallcaps).

- normal : Specifies the normal font by default.
- small-caps : specifies a small uppercase font.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.

```js
object.style.fontVariant="small-caps"

```

### font-weight

Specifies the thickness of the font.

```css
p.normal {font-weight:normal;}
p.thick {font-weight:bold;}
p.thicker {font-weight:900;}

```

- normal : Specifies the normal thickness by default.
- bold : Specifies the bold font.
- bolder : Specifies fonts with thickness greater than the default bold.
- lighter : Specifies a font thinner than normal.
- 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900: 100 are the thinnest and the thicker the number becomes. 400 is like normal and 700 is like bold.

### letter-spacing

Specifies the additional space (between characters).

```css
h1 {letter-spacing:2px;}
h2 {letter-spacing:-3px;}

```

- If a negative value is specified, reduce the spacing between characters.

- normal : Specifies the default interval.
- Length: Specifies the value followed by the absolute unit designator (cm, mm, in, pt, pc) or relative unit designator (em, ex, px) after the floating point number.
- inherit: inherits the value from the parent element.
