Among the metadata contained in the inodes are three timestamps (atime, ctime, and mtime) associated with the file.

### atime (access time)

The date and time when the file was last accessed.

Each time an application or service reads a file using a system call, the file access time is updated.

Example of use)

The contents were accessed by opening the file with a text editor. The file access time is updated.

```bash
vi hello.txt

```

### mtime (modification time)

The date and time when the file was last modified.

The file modification time is updated when the contents of the file are changed.

Example of use)

The file data is modified, updating both the time to modify the file and the time to change the file.

```bash
echo "Hello~ World!" >> hello.txt

```

### ctime (change time)

The date and time when the file was last changed.

This timestamp relates to both changes in file properties (i.e., changes in inodes) and changes in file data.

Example of use)

File permissions have been changed. Therefore, the file change time is updated because the inode has been changed.

```bash
chmod 755 hello.sh

```

Use the stat command to view all timestamps associated with a file.

```bash
stat hello.txt

```
