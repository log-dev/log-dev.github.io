I introduce Timeline JS, one of the tools that can express the flow of time more dynamically when you need a page that shows the flow of time, such as history and history. Updated from existing version to version 3.

### Introducing Timeline JS 3

Timeline JS 3 has been rewritten in its original version to provide more flexibility for authors and developers. Many parts have been twisted, and since it is a famous tool, it continues to provide existing versions for existing users.

- Flexible row layout: there is no longer a limitation of 3/6 rows.
- Encapsulation: More than one timeline per page is possible.
- Supporting a very large time interval: Dinosaurs! Big Bang! (Very huge)
- New Media Type: Dropbox Image, DocumentCloud
- Aborting support for Pagekeeper (screenshot of website)
- Developer Features: Architecture Cleaner, Unit Testing, Events

### Create Timeline

Timeline JS works on any site or blog, and below we learn how to write in four steps.

Create a new Google Spreadsheet using the templates provided. Referring to previously entered information, the date, text, and links are deleted in moderation and replaced by information. For more information on working with templates, see this document (see below).

Do not change the column header and do not remove any columns. Also, don`t leave empty lines on the spreadsheet.

If you are using the existing Timeline JS version, let`s proceed to step 3.

Select File > Publish to Web on the spreadsheet. When a pop-up window pops up, click the "Publish" button and ask for confirmation again, and accept it. Copy the URL in the middle of the pop-up window.

Go to Timeline JS`s homepage, paste the copied URL into Make Timeline item 3, and set the size. Select an option button and finish language settings and other settings.

Paste the generated code at the bottom into the page you want.

> We've just looked at how to use it, and if we could make it into a simple input form, not a spreadsheet, it would be a very useful plug-in. I think there will be a similar plugin already.
