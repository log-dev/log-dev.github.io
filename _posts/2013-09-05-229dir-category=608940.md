You can install cloud systems on a private server and use them without limitation, such as N drives or the following cloud: It`s open-source, but it also supports smartphones and almost all the functions of existing cloud systems.

### Preparing to install the downCloud

It is carried out assuming that APM is installed.

Installing the library required for the downCloud installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install php5-gd php-xml-parser php5-intl smbclient curl libcurl3 php5-curl

```

Enable Apache Module

```bash
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod headers

```

Open Apache Settings File

```bash
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-default

```

Changing the < part of the directory /var/www/

```undefined
sudo service apache2 restart

```

### installing downCloud downloads

Download the latest version

```bash
sudo wget http://download.owncloud.org/community/owncloud-latest.tar.bz2

```

Decompress

```bash
sudo tar -xjf owncloud-latest.tar.bz2

```

Move the downCloud source file to the desired directory

```bash
mv owncloud /var/www

```

Adjust Ownership

```bash
cd /var/www
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data owncloud

```

Connect to MySQL

```bash
mysql -u root -p

```

creating the downCloud database

```undefined
CREATE DATABASE owncloud;

```

Set ID and Off-Time

```undefined
GRANT ALL ON owncloud.* TO 'owncloud'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_password';

```

Connect to the downCloud and set up DB

http://server address/owncloud

Specify the ID and PW to be used as administrator

Enter the DB information generated above

### Troubleshooting

After accessing the administrator page of the downcloud, I saw some errors and logged on to the log file, and there was an error as below.

```undefined
[Mon Nov 11 20:39:39 2013] [error] [client 192.168.0.1] client denied by server configuration: /var/www/cloud.uzuro.com/public_html/owncloud/data/htaccesstest.txt

```

Normally, the error occurs when the administrator menu is entered while operating without any problems. I searched for bugs related to it, but so far I have not found a suitable solution.

Notes found articles about setting `AllowOverride All` in the virtual host setup file and disabling mod_negotiation to eliminate the output of error messages.

However, in my case, nothing helped me solve the problem.

```undefined
<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
