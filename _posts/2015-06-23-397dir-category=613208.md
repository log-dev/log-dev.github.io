Plug-ins that help convert encoding, however, any encoding attempts to convert to UTF-8 and vice versa is not supported.

### EncodingHelper 소개

EncodingHelper aims to help convert documents to UTF-8 and has the following characteristics:

- Try to guess the encoding of the file.
- When an incorrect encoding or encoding is opened, it is displayed when the current document is broken.
- Select the type of encoding from the menu and convert it to UTF-8.
- The menu item quickly converts the guessed encoding to UTF-8.
- User preferences find the defined encoding and automatically convert it to UTF-8.

We are trying to guess the encoding of the file, but we need to be aware that it is not 100% accurate. It also includes many optimizations to consume CPUs.

### EncodingHelper 설치

- After executing the sublime text, command Palette is recalled with the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P.
- Select Package Control: Install Package, which is automatically completed when `install` is entered, and press Enter.
- Enter `encoding` to select EncodingHelper when it is detected, then press Enter to install it.

> I use it for checking the status of the document rather than for the opportunity to use it for conversion.
