Before building a mail server, let`s talk about how it works.

### Terms Related to E-mail

Concepts of operation of mail servers

Mail User Agent stands for programs that allow users to read, reply, and delete E-mail. It refers to client programs such as Outlook Express (Outlook), which we commonly use.

The program installed on PC1, PC2 in the picture.

It stands for Mail Transport Agent, a post office that handles E-mail written and transmitted by MUA. The mail server we want to learn is MTA.

The figure indicates MailServer1 and MailServer2.

The Mail Delivery Agent stands for E-mail transmitted by the MUA, which takes over from the MTA and sends it to the MUA before the recipient receives it again. Although not shown in the figure, mail servers at daum.net and paran.com have MDA for account users, keeping them if users do not receive mail using MUA.

MDA is used as POP3 and IMAP.

It stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is used by TCP/IP to deliver E-mail. It uses TCP 25 ports by default.

It is used to send mail from a PC to a mail server, and to send and receive mail between mail servers.

It is the receiving mail server that we usually know. It was named because POP3 or IMAP daemons were used to receive E-mail from MTA to MDA.

Finally, it is called an incoming mail server because it has the contents of an E-mail before the MUA receives it.

| Distinguished | POP3 | IMAP |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ports Used | 110 | 143 |
| Purpose | Installed within a mail server. It is responsible for bringing mail to Outlook and others when it arrives in the mail server. Acting as the receiving server from the user's perspective. | |
| Mail export and then | does not exist within the mail server. When a user exports mail, it is deleted immediately from the server. | Remained undeleted from mail server. Cleared only after user checks mail and deletes it. |
| Shortcomings | Relatively easy to implement. There are relatively many clients that support it. It is uncomfortable when there are many places to use mail. | Difficult to implement compared to POP3. There are not many clients that support POP3. It is convenient when there are many places where you use mail.(Office, House, etc.) |
