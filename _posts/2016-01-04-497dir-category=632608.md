The class name has been newly added to the category list structure of T-story Skin. I`ve been using complicated CSS selectors for category design or adding classes with scripts, but I think it`ll be a little easier.

### Structure of Category List

Below is a structure that is created when a replacement patient is used.

> Replace the shop with '##'

```html
<ul class="tt_category">
<li>
<a class="link_tit" href="/category">분류 전체보기 <span class="c_cnt">(글갯수)</span></a>
<ul class="category_list">
<li>
<a class="link_item" href="...">카테고리명 <span class="c_cnt">(글갯수)</span></a>
<ul class="sub_category_list">
<li>
<a class="link_sub_item" href="..."...>Sub category name <span class="c_cnt">(letters)</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

```

- At the beginning of the list of categories:tt_category` was added - line 1.
- The top-level list of categories lists is ` .`link_tit` added - line 3
- A `.category_list` was added at the beginning of the first category in the category list. - Row 4.
- The link to the primary category in the category list ` .link_item` was added. - Row 6
- If there is a secondary category in the category list, at the beginning.sub_category_list` is added. - Row 7.
- Links to secondary categories in the category list are added with `link_sub_item`. - Row 9.

Thus, there will be no problem in changing the design of the general category list. However, the classes for the currently active categories are not yet given, so scripts should replace them.
