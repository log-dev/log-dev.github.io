meta tag

Metatags are used to define information that is interchanged between a web server and a web browser.

A special tag that you enter between <head> and </head> of an HTML document that has no effect on the design of the site, contains the content of the document itself, the keywords of the document, and who created it.

### Property of Metatag

Metatag properties have three properties: http-equiv, name, and content.

http-equiv="item name"

Web browsers can be used instead of the name property as the property that commands the server, meaning only when HTML documents are sent from the web server with the response header to the web browser.

content="Information value"

Specifies the content of the meta information.

name="Information Name"

You can name a few meta information and if not, it functions like http-equiv.

### Type of Metatag

- Specifies the word that is searched by the search engine.

```undefined
<meta name="Keywords" content="Web, html, 웹 표준" />
```

- Specifies the characters that appear in the search results.

```undefined
<meta name="Description" content="Web, html, 웹 표준" />
```

- Discovery Robot Control

```undefined
<meta name="Robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />
```

The command to the search robot is specified in the format `<meta name="robots">`.

content The property can be specified as follows and is separated by a comma (,) when multiple specified:

- All (default) : same as specified `index, follow`.
- None : Same as specified `noindex, nofollow`.
- Index : The page is a collection target.
- Follow: Collects where the link is located, including the page.
- Noindex : Excludes the page from the collection target.
- Noofollow: The link to the page is not intended for collection.

The html4.01 recommendation for the values of these name and content properties states that they are capitalized and distinguished from upper and lower case, but the actual search robot does not distinguish upper and lower case.

The values below are also used, but there are properties that are not accepted by web standards.

> Noarchive : Does not cache that page.
Noimageindex : Excludes images contained on that page from being searched.
Noimageclick : Prevents links to images contained on that page.

- Set Type of Character Code

```undefined
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
```

Type of character encoding

> EUC-KR / ISO-2022-KR : Korean character encoding
EUC-JP / ISO-2022-JP: Japanese character encoding
GB2312 : Chinese character encoding
ISO-8859-1: North America, Western Europe, Latin America, Caribbean, Canada, Africa
ISO-8859-2: Eastern Europe
ISO-8859-3: Esperanto, South East Europe
ISO-8859-4: Scandinavia, Baltic States
ISO-8859-5: Bulgarian, Belarusian, Russian, Macedonia
ISO-8859-6: Arabic alphabet
ISO-8859-7: Mathematical symbols as well as modern Greek alphabetical languages
ISO-8859-8: Hebrew-speaking languages
ISO-8859-9: Turkish
ISO-8859-10: Eskimo, Nordic languages
UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32: Encoding to support characters in all languages

The ISO-number type character settings listed above should be replaced by Unicode standards developed by the Unicode Consortium because they are limited in size and incompatible in multilingual environments.

Unicode standards apply to all character settings, punctuation marks, and world symbols.

Unicode allows you to remember or change the platform of any text in any language or program.

The Unicode Consortium develops Unicode standards.

Their goal is to replace existing characters with Unicode Transformation Format (UTF).

Unicode standards are implemented in xml, java, ECMAScript (JavaScript), LDAP, and WML. The Unicode standard is supported on multiple operating systems and all modern web browsers.

The Unicode Consortium works with major standards development organizations (ISO, W3C, ECMA).

It prevents pages from being imported from cache and always contacts the server to import pages.

Therefore, even if you let visitors` browsers read cache at all times, they ignore it and update the page.

Frequently fixed pages can always show visitors what has changed using them.

However, the page output speed is that it takes a lot of time because the cache is not available because the page is imported every time.
