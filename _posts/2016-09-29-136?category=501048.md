### In JavaScript, a class is...It's a constructor function!

If a function is a grammar used to group phrases (algorithms, logic) that have a specific function, the class is a technique that selects and packs only the associated variables and functions among the many variables and functions created.

In other words, it is a grammar used to combine the associated variables and functions.

The reason for packing into this class is that you can group code by object and reuse the code.

### Why do you pack it in class?

> To use code grouping and code reuse on a per-object basis.
If you compare it with the function, you can compare it as follows:

1) Function-based unit

Packaging content: Wrap up a variable + syntax (algorithm) that functions specifically.

Function:

> - Code grouping of functional units
- feature unit deduplication and code reuse

2) Class-based units

Packaging content: Wrap around associated variables and functions.

Function:

> - Variables and functions in object units
- Remove duplicate code per object and reuse code.

In other words, when you have a slider with the UI, when you create logic, if you have many functions, such as an indicator function, next, prev button, then function-based coding usually implements logic for each of the slider`s necessary functions, which pollutes the global scope and makes it hard to maintain.

However, if you code on a class-by-class basis, you can group all the functions for the slider and manage them.

Therefore, it is possible to group related variables and functions as a representative function of the class.

It is important to group functions.

The advantage of using this class is that it can eliminate redundant code in the gecko unit and improves code reuse.

The reusability of code means that, for example, if you need to create a web page containing three tab panels, you can make all three tab panels work independently of one class.

### 3 ways to create a class in JavaScript

In fact, JavaScript does not offer the concept of a class that is built into the object-oriented programming language.

There is a way to use a class because the constructor function is a class-like concept in another language.

Therefore, JavaScript does not have a class, but there is a grammar that can be used similarly, such as OOP.

Here are three ways.

> 1) Literal method

2) Functional method

3) Prototype method

1) Literal Class

2) Functional classes

3) Prototype class

You can use the class in three different patterns as shown above.

However, each of the three patterns has its advantages and disadvantages, so you have to selectively use them according to the situation.

To tell you one disadvantage, the functional class, which seems to have no disadvantages, has a very fatal disadvantage.

Every time you create an instance, all internal methods are created independently.

For example, when you create a tab menu, if you say that you operate multiple tab menus individually in one class, there is only one class, but if you create an instance for each tab menu, each instance has its own defined variables or functions independently, resulting in a memory leak.

This means that duplicate variables and duplicate methods are created for each instance.

In this posting, let`s briefly talk about some of the concepts you need to know when using the class.

### Instances

Just as a typical function requires a function to be declared and then called, for a class, the internal functions of the functions in the class must be created to use the class`s internal functions.

In other words, if the class is a design drawing, the instance is where the substance of the design is contained.

The class (creator function) is a blueprint and the instance is a entity.

> e.g.) Assuming that bungeoppang is produced: bungeoppang frame = class, bungeoppang = instance

Typically, the following methods are used to create instances:

### What is an Object?

The object is another name for the instance and is called an instance or object depending on the situation at that time.

Instances are often referred to as objects when they are used to create entities of a class using the new operator and in addition to using the properties and methods provided by the class.

Properties are also known as member variables, which are created (packaged) inside a class.

Methods are called methods and are also called member functions that you create (package) in a class.

The method primarily contains the ability to change or determine the property value of an object and the ability to represent the class.

So far, we`ve just had a quick look at the class, and you`ll see the links below, which may be the same, but a slightly different approach, and what we`re talking about.
