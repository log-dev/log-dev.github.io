Learn how to extract thumbnails from daily motion videos. In this article, we used JavaScript, which is easier to access if you use a server script.

### Extract Daily Motion Video VID

Suppose a Daily Motion video was inserted somewhere as shown below. Most multimedia services require extraction of this VID value to distinguish images with their own ID values (VIDs) and to classify each information.

```html
<iframe frameborder="0" width="560" height="315" src="//www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/x3h91ah" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

```

Among the inserted video source codes (iframes), the daily motion videos filter out regular expressions based on the special strings they have.

```js
var vurl = $('iframe').attr('src').match(/dailymotion.com\/embed\/video\/([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)/i);

```

Extract the VID by truncating the string from the selected Daily Motion video.

```js
var vidStr = vurl.indexOf("video/");
var vid = vurl.slice(vidStr+6);

```

### Request jsonp data via Ajax

We use extracted VID values to access the data provided by Dailymotion. However, requests are made in the form of jsonp to bypass cross-domain policies.

```js
var thumb = "thumbnail_240_url";
var ajaxUrl = 'https://api.dailymotion.com/video/'+vid+'?fields='+thumb;
$.ajax({
url: ajaxUrl,
dataType: "jsonp",
jsonp: "callback"
})

```

The size of the thumbnail provided by Daily Motion is as follows, and the number indicates the height of the thumbnail. The above code specifies a height of 240px.

If you look at the jsop data provided by Daily Motion, you can see the key:value of the thumbnail.

```json
jQuery111305451841745525599_1451030966661({
"thumbnail_240_url":"http:\/\/s1.dmcdn.net\/Qp8aH\/x240-5Vq.jpg"
});

```

```js
$.ajax({
url: ajaxUrl,
dataType: "jsonp",
jsonp: "callback"

}).done(function (data) {
var vsrc = data[thumb];
$('.thumbnail').append('<img src="'+vsrc+'">');

}).fail(function (data) {
alert('Daily Motion Thumbnail extraction failed!');
});

```

The thumbnail of the Daily Motion video can be obtained in approximately the same way, and it is possible without having to issue an API key.

### Daily Motion API
