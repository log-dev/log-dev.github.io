The following error was suddenly found in the chromium developer tool. VM: The following numbers continue to change.

GET http://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/forton/http_headers_1.js VM7376:1

I thought hard about what kind of error this is.

- Did any of the codes inserted in the ongoing project insert a hacking code that receives and exports something from an external server?
- What is being done to gather information from the recently reinstalled VMware (virtual machine)?
- etc.

In a related development, he discovered a suspected part of the search and inferred that it could be related to the code used to create Google`s extensions. When I stopped using each of the installed extensions, an extension called HTTP Headers was the cause of the problem.
