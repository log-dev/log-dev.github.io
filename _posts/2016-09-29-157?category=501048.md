Class (=creator) method cleanup

For example, C++ or Java, programmers can create classes by providing the keyword class.

Implementing a constructor with a method with the same name as the class. However, JavaScript does not have this concept.

However, almost everything in JavaScript is an object, especially a function object roll, so classes, constructors, and scalpels can all be implemented as functions.

### Generators

The constructor is called by the new operator and is responsible for initializing the object.

new constructor function () => new class name in Java ()

In other words, in JavaScript, the constructor function acts as a class and constructor because there are no class keywords.

### The role of the constructor in JavaScript

Set the value of the data (set the variable) or call the method to prepare the object for use.

Let`s take a look at the following examples.

```js
function Person(arg) {

this.name = arg;

this.getName = function () {
return this.name;
}

this.setName = function (value) {
this.name = value;
}
}

var me = new Person('jaehee');
/**
* Created new object me with new keyword.
* Function Person acts as a class and constructor.
*/
console.log(me.getName()); // jaehee

me.setName('JavaScript');
console.log(me.getName()); // JavaScript
```

The code form above is very similar to the code that creates an instance of a class in an existing object-oriented programming language.

The function person acts as a class and constructor at the same time, and this is the basic form of class-based object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

In other words, there are functions that act as classes and constructors, and users can create and use instances using the new keyword. The me generated from the example code is an instance of the person, which has a name variable and a structure with the getName() and setName() functions.

However, there is a problem with this example.

For example, suppose you use this person as the constructor to create objects that are multiple instances.

```js
var me = new Person('me');
var you = new Person('you');
var her = new Person('her');
```

If you create and use multiple instances as shown above, it will work without any problems on the surface. However, each object (instance) is creating a setName() function and getName() function that are common in its own region. This means unnecessarily overlapping areas will be placed in memory and will result in wasted resources and reduced performance.

Therefore, a different approach is required to solve these problems, using a prototype of a function object, a characteristic of JavaScript that can be utilized here.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

```js
function Person(arg) {
this.name = arg;
}

Person.prototype.getName = function () {
return this.name;
};

Person.prototype.setName = function (value) {
this.name = value;
};


var me = new Person('jaehee');
var you = new Person('you');

console.log(me.getName()); // jaehee
console.log(you.getName()); // you
```

The above code defines the getName() and setName() functions in the prototype property of the Person function object.

If you create an object with this person, you can access and use the setName() and getName() functions in one place, the space of the prototype object, which is the space that the object has in common, without having to create a separate getName() and setName() function object. To be exact, it is accessed through a prototype chain.

When defining methods within a class in JavaScript, it is recommended that you define them on a prototype object and then make them accessible from objects created with new.

> @ Object and Class
Real World: Design → Object (Design drawings required to build an apartment, apartment completed with a blueprint)
Java: Class → Object
The class defines fields and methods for creating objects.
Objects created from a class are called instances of that class. (Usually, objects are sometimes called instances)
If an object refers to an object that is used independently, the instance focuses on what design it is based on.
Multiple instances can be created from one class.

To create an object in JAVA

```js
// Create an Object for JAVA
HelloOO hello_oo = new HelloOO
```
