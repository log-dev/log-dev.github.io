Using CSS Animation

CSS3 animation seamlessly converts CSS styles applied to elements to other CSS styles.

Animation consists of a CSS style representing animation and keyframes representing the intermediate state of animation.

CSS animation has advantages over traditional scripted animation for three reasons:

- You can easily create animations even if you don`t know JavaScript.
- Animation using JavaScript may not perform well even though it is well made. CSS animation is rendered as smoothly as possible using multiple technologies such as frame-skipping.
- The browser can efficiently optimize the performance of animation. For example, animations about elements that are not currently visible can minimize the load by reducing the update cycle.

### Apply Animation

To create a CSS animation, specify the animation property and its child properties. You can specify the total time and repeatability of the animation.

Keep in mind that this property does not describe the intermediate state of the animation.

The intermediate state of the animation is described using the @keyframes rule to be covered below.

The animation property has the following sub-attributes:

animation-delay

- Specifies when the animation starts after the element is loaded.

animation-direction

- Specifies whether the animation will end and resume from the beginning or reverse.

animation-duration

- Specifies how long an animation in a cycle will take place.

animation-iteration-count

- Specifies how many times the animation repeats. You can repeat indefinitely by specifying it as infinity.

animation-name

- Specifies the intermediate state of this animation. The intermediate state is described using the @keyframes rule.

animation-play-state

- You can stop or restart the animation.

animation-timing-function

- Specifies at what time interval the transition of intermediate states will take place.

animation-fill-mode

- Specifies what values apply before or after the animation starts.

### Describe the middle state of an animation using a keyframe

Let`s describe the intermediate state of the animation.

Use the @keyframes rule to describe two or more intermediate states.

Each intermediate state indicates what the element will look like at a certain point in time.

If you have defined how the intermediate state will look using the CSS style, specify when this intermediate state will appear in the entire animation.

0% indicates when the animation started and 100% indicates when the animation ended.

At least these two points in time must be described before the browser knows when the animation starts and ends.

You can also use from and to instead of 0% and 100%.

You can also specify an intermediate state at a specific point between the start and end points.

Allow text to move across browsers

In the following simple example, you can see the <p> element moving across the browser window from right to left.

```undefined
<p>The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed
her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p>
```

```css
p {
animation-duration: 3s;
animation-name: slidein;
}

@keyframes slidein {
from {
margin-left: 100%;
width: 300%
}

to {
margin-left: 0%;
width: 100%;
}
}
```

The CSS rule specified in the `<p>` element specified a total length of 3 seconds for animation through the `animation-duration` property. The middle states of the animation were described using the rule of `@keyframes` and named them `slidein`.

And I assigned an animation called slidein to the p element. For browsers that do not support CSS animation, you can do so if you want to assign a specific style to `<p>`. You can do that here, but in this example you do not specify to view animation effects only.

The intermediate state of the animation is described using the @keyframes rule.

In this case, we described two intermediate states. The first intermediate state is to specify the left margin at 100% at 0% (from keyword is acceptable to use the from keyword).

Because you have specified a left margin of 100%, an element is drawn in the right corner of the browser window at the time the animation began.

The second intermediate state is to specify a left margin of 0% at 100% (to keyword is acceptable) after the animation starts.

Therefore, at the end of the animation, the element is drawn in the left corner of the browser window.

See the Pen

To add an intermediate state

Let`s add an intermediate state from the animation in the previous example.

When the element moves from left to right, let`s make the font size increase and then decrease again.

You can add the following intermediate states:

```css
75% {
font-size: 300%;
margin-left: 25%;
width: 150%;
}
```

This means that at 75% of the animation, the left margin of the element should be 25% wide, 150% wide, and 300% characterize 300%.

Repeating anime

If you want to repeat the animation, you can use the `animation-teration-count` property.

This property lets you specify how many times the animation repeats.

In this example, let`s specify a value called infinite and make it repeat indefinitely.

```css
p {
animation-duration: 3s;
animation-name: slidein;
animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
```

See the Pen

Move back and forth

You`ve seen the animation repeat before.

But it`s awkward to go back to the right corner after the animation.

Let`s make it move in the opposite direction when the animation is over.

You can specify the property `animation-direction` as `alternate`.

```css
p {
animation-duration: 3s;
animation-name: slidein;
animation-iteration-count: infinite;
animation-direction: alternate;
}
```

See the Pen

### Animation Event

Using animated events

You can control the animation by using animation events.

An animation event, referred to as an `Animation Event`, can be used to detect the start, end, and start of a new iteration.

Whenever an event occurs, you can also know what kind of event it is and what animation it is from.

Let`s find out how to use an animation event by modifying the moving letter example above.

```css
.slidein {
-moz-animation-duration: 3s;
-webkit-animation-duration: 3s;
animation-duration: 3s;
-moz-animation-name: slidein;
-webkit-animation-name: slidein;
animation-name: slidein;
-moz-animation-iteration-count: 3;
-webkit-animation-iteration-count: 3;
animation-iteration-count: 3;
-moz-animation-direction: alternate;
-webkit-animation-direction: alternate;
animation-direction: alternate;
}

@-moz-keyframes slidein {
from {
margin-left: 100%;
width: 300%
}

to {
margin-left: 0%;
width: 100%;
}
}

@-webkit-keyframes slidein {
from {
margin-left: 100%;
width: 300%
}

to {
margin-left: 0%;
width: 100%;
}
}

@keyframes slidein {
from {
margin-left: 100%;
width: 300%
}

to {
margin-left: 0%;
width: 100%;
}
}
```

To add an animation event listener

Let`s use the JavaScript code to detect the three events mentioned above.

The `setup()` function is a function that adds an animation event listener.

You will run this function when the document is loaded.

```js
function setup() {
var e = document.getElementById("watchme");
e.addEventListener("animationstart", listener, false);
e.addEventListener("animationend", listener, false);
e.addEventListener("animationiteration", listener, false);

var e = document.getElementById("watchme");
e.className = "slidein";
}
```

To learn more about how it works, refer to the element.addEventListener() documentation.

The animation starts as soon as you specify the class of the element as `slidein` in the last line of the `setup() function.

Why did I do this? Because the animation start event occurs as soon as the animation starts, so our code cannot detect it.

When the animation starts, the event listener has not been added yet because the above code is before it is executed.

Therefore, the event listener was added first and the element was classified to start the animation.

Receive Events

Each event is handed over to the `listener()` function.

The code for this function is shown below.

```js
function listener(e) {
var l = document.createElement("li");
switch(e.type) {
case "animationstart":
linnerHTML = "Started: elapsed time is " + e.elapsedTime;
break;
case "animationend":
linnerHTML = "Ended: elapsed time is " + e.elapsedTime;
break;
case "animationiteration":
linnerHTML = "New loop started at time " + e.elapsedTime;
break;
}
document.getElementById("output").appendChild(l);
}
```

This code is very simple, too. View `event.type` to determine what events occurred.

Add an element representing the log of the event to the `<ul>` (list without sequence).

And here are the results.

- Started: elapsed time is 0
- New loop started at time 3.01200008392334
- New loop started at time 6.00600004196167
- Ended: elapsed time is 9.234000205993652

Remember that the time when the event occurred is very close to the animation time specified above, but it is not exactly the same.

Also, remember that when the animation ended, the animation event did not occur and the animation end event occurred.
