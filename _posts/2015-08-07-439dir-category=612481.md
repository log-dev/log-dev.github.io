Those who usually work with coding may already be using some plug-ins or libraries that indicate it, or using online highlighting services. Highlight.js also describe the installation experience as one of those libraries.

### Highlight.js Introduction

Highlight.js is a JavaScript library for highlighting code phrases. It works well on servers as well as browsers. It does not rely on any framework, operates on almost any markup and has automatic language detection.

- It offers 130 languages and 65 styles. Live Demo
- We automatically find the used code syntax and express it in the appropriate style.
- Syntax emphasis is possible on various mixed codes.
- It is available in node.js.
- Works with any markup.
- It is compatible with any JavaScript framework.
- Modern browsers support IE9 and later.

Detailed instructions for use can be found in the highlight.js documentation.

### Install Highlight.js

When you access the website and click the Get Version button, two methods are mentioned: Hosted and Custom package.

22 commonly used languages are preconfigured and hosted via CDN (including Apache, Bash, C#, C++, CSS, CoffeeScript, Diff, HTML, XML, HTTP, Ini, JSON, JavaScript, Makefile, Markdown, Nginx, Objective C, SQL, Perlub, etc.).

There are two CDNs below, so you can choose what you want and insert them into the `head`.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/8.7/styles/default.min.css">
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/8.7/highlight.min.js"></script>

```

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/highlight.js/8.7/styles/default.min.css">
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/highlight.js/8.7/highlight.min.js"></script>

```

To use a different style of design than the basic theme, check out the designs applied to Styles on the HIGHLIGHT.js demo page and remember the name of the style you like. Afterwards, the css file name of CDN`s `link` can be modified by comparing the file name of the theme file.

Below is an example of setting the theme of a sub-lime text.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/highlight.js/8.7/styles/monokai_sublime.min.css">

```

Finally, you can activate Highlight.js. Below is the final code.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/highlight.js/8.7/styles/monokai_sublime.min.css">
<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/highlight.js/8.7/highlight.min.js"></script>
<script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script>

```

If there are additional languages that require syntactic emphasis in addition to the 22 languages that are basically serviced, you can select the languages to include and download them. The downloaded file contains the `highlight.pack.js` file and the CSS theme file, so you can upload it to your account and insert it.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/styles/default.css">
<script src="/path/to/highlight.pack.js"></script>
<script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script>

```

### How to use Highlight.js

It automatically finds the `pre><code>` included in the page and applies syntax highlighting, but it often does not work as desired. In this case, it is possible to specify a language using `class` properties.

```html
<pre><code class="html">...</code></pre>

```

Supported language class names can be found in class reference.

If you do not want to use syntax highlighting, you can use `no highlight` class.

```html
<pre><code class="nohighlight">...</code></pre>

```

### Initialize Highlight.js custom

HighlightBlock and configuration functions are available if you need to further adjust Highlight.js. This can be adjusted when and which one to highlight.

Below we introduce a method similar to initHighlightingOnLoad call using jQuery.

```undefined
$(document).ready(function() {
$('pre code').each(function(i, block) {
hljs.highlightBlock(block);
});
});

```

Any markup tag written on the page can replace <pre><code>. If you do not use a container (pre) that preserves line breaks, you must change the HIGHLIGHT.js setting to use the `<br>` tag.

```undefined
hljs.configure({useBR: true});

$('div.code').each(function(i, block) {
hljs.highlightBlock(block);
});

```

Let`s look at the configuration documentation for other options.

### IE8 Error due to unsupported

Recent libraries are reducing support for older versions of IE. HIGHLIGHT.js also indicate in the status window that there is an error in IE8 and earlier versions because of IE8.

It is not an alert with a notification window, but if this is intrusive, it can be thought of dividing the branches for IE8 and lower versions and adding scripts dynamically.

### Significant points when used in tea story

T-story and other CMSs support HTML mode separately on the editor. Syntax highlighting should be written using this HTML mode because it requires the insertion of a tag called `pre><code>.

If HTML is the content of code that will emphasize syntax, then `<` and `>` (End Tag) will be used.

```html
'<pre><code>code content
</code></pre>

```

Editor mode automatically replaces the start and end tags, so you don`t have to modify them one by one, and you can erase the code contents and write the actual code contents.

When writing code content in editor mode, it is not possible to change the line to enter, but to use Shift + Enter.
