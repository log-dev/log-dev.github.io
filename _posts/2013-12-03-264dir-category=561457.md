When a message from HTTP is created and sent to a web server, it is sent to the OS, which must be investigated by the server`s domain name written in the URL. This is because when requesting transmission to OS, it is necessary to designate a person to receive messages through IP address, not domain name.

### TCP/IP

Internet or in-house LANs are based on the concept of TCP/IP. A TCP/IP network connects a small subnet to a router to complete the entire network. The subnet can be seen as a unit of consent such as "Samsung-dong" in our address system, and it is the network address that assigns the number corresponding to the number to the computer, such as "Samsung-dong 22nd." The number corresponding to the movement is called the network number, the number corresponding to the number is called the host number, and the IP address is a combination of these two addresses.

When transporting messages to the server of the access target, the IP address is used to transport the message to the server of the access target. The principle is that the opponent`s data eventually arrives by transporting it through a subnet to a hub, then through a router, and then repeatedly moving it to the next router, and this is the basic concept of TCP/IP and IP addresses.

The actual IP address is 32 bits of digital data, separated by 8 bits (1 byte) by dots, and denoted in decimal numbers. This form is usually an IP address, along with information that represents the network history, which is called netmask.

10.11.12.13

10.11.12.13 (IP Address Body) / 255.255.255.0 (Netmask)

10.11.12.13 (IP Address Body)/24 (Netmask)

10.11.12.0/24 - All bits in the host number portion are zero, indicating the subnet itself, not each computer.

10.11.12.255/24 - All bits in the host number portion are 1 indicates a broadcast throughout the subnet

### Reason for distinguishing domain names from IP addresses

TCP/IP`s network designates a communication partner with this IP address, so if you do not know the IP address, you cannot send a message to the opponent. This situation is similar to the other person`s phone number required to make a call. It is okay to use IP addresses instead of domains, but numbers are not human-friendly, making it difficult to remember. Conversely, changing the IP address scheme to a domain has up to 255 bytes of bandwidth, which increases the load on the router. Thus, it is reasonable for humans to go through the process of using domains and converting them into an IP address system, which is DNS.

### Socket Library and DNS

The Socket Library is a library for C languages developed by the University of California`s Berkeley campus as a derivative of the UNIX OS called BSD, and many features used on the Internet were developed using the Socket Library. Thus, the Socket library was modeled after the Socket library in an OS other than BSD or a language other than C, making it the standard library for networks.

To convert a domain name to an IP address, a DNS server must be viewed as a client for the DNS server, which is called a DNS resolver or simply a resolver. Using the principle of DNS to investigate IP addresses is called a name resolution, which runs a resolver. Resolver is a componentized program contained in the Socket Library. When examining IP addresses in furnace domain names, the browser uses a resolver in the Socket library.

### Query Resolver and DNS server

When a resolver is called in an application such as a browser, the resolver sends a lookup message to the DNS server, and the DNS server returns a response message. This response message contains an IP address, so the resolver extracts it and places it in the browser-specified memory area, where the browser sends a message to the web server, it extracts the IP address and passes it to the OS with HTTP`s request message. The protocol stack embedded inside the OS is called to request execution.
