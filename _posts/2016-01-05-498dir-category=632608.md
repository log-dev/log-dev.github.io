Take a look at the comments and reminders you might encounter when designing your guest book.

### Comments and guest book scripts

The script that handles the comments and the contents entered in the guest book form in T-story is as follows.

```js
function addComment(caller, entryId) {
var oForm = findFormObject(caller);
if (!oForm)
return false;
var request = new HTTPRequest("POST", oForm.action);
request.onSuccess = function () {
if(entryId == 0)
window.location = blogURL + "/guestbook";
else {
document.getElementById("entry" + entryId + "Comment").innerHTML = this.getText("/response/commentBlock");
if(document.getElementById("recentComments"))
document.getElementById("recentComments").innerHTML = this.getText("/response/recentCommentBlock");
if(document.getElementById("commentCount" + entryId))
document.getElementById("commentCount" + entryId).innerHTML = this.getText("/response/commentView");
if(document.getElementById("commentCountOnRecentEntries" + entryId))
document.getElementById("commentCountOnRecentEntries" + entryId).innerHTML = "(" + this.getText("/response/commentCount") + ")";
}
if(typeof window.needCommentCaptcha !== "undefined"){
captchaPlugin.init('complete');
}
}
request.onError = function() {
var description = this.getText("/response/description");
if (description) { alert(description); }
}
var queryString = "key=tistory";
var captchaInput = document.getElementById('inputCaptcha');
if (oForm["name"])
queryString += "
```

Unlike the usual way of refreshing pages to send and update entries in a form, AJAX is used to communicate with the server side and the comments are updated without refreshing the entire page.

Contents that are answered by AJAX request are XML documents as shown below, and `commentBlock` defined here is the area defined by `s_rp`, which is a comment area that is inserted during skin production.

### Link comments and guest book events

In other words, if you enter a comment and press the Send button, the above scripts will be executed and the comments and guest book areas will be replaced with contents responded with AJAX. If you have a general design in mind, it is less likely to cause problems, but if you plan a design, such as linking events and giving them some action using a script, it may be embarrassing because it does not work as desired. No additional error messages will be exposed.

In fact, dynamically generated structures should be given dynamic event connections. If you are using jQuery, you will be familiar with the use of `.on()`.

In general cases, events will be linked like the former, but dynamic connections will be the same as the latter.

```js
$('.focus-target').on('focus', function(){
$(this).closest('.focus-wrap').addClass('focus');
});

$(document).on('focus', '.focus-target', function(){
$(this).closest('.focus-wrap').addClass('focus');
});

```
