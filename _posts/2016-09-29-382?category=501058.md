Variable Scope

An error occurs if the variable is not within the area where it is accessible or accessible from the internal code that is defining the function.

The developer defining the function must understand what variables they can access from the function they define.

In this article, you will learn about the variable scope of JavaScript.

The mechanism for managing variables in JavaScript is one of the more distinctive aspects of normal language.

If you understand the variable management of JavaScript, you can understand the confusion or sensitivity of JavaScript.

The concepts associated with variable management mechanisms include variable scope chains, closures, closures that generate functions or objects, module patterns, and jQuery code structures, which may be difficult to understand if you do not understand how to manage variables.

Variable scope → Variable scope chain → Closer → Function of closure, object generation → Module pattern → jQuery code structure

Here are three characteristics of the mechanism for managing variables in JavaScript:

- Variables are managed in units of functions.
- The variable search at run time is based on the lexical region.
- In execution, variable search uses a chain of variable scopes.

### Managing variables in function units

In other programming languages, it is common to use braces to determine the region of a variable.

For example, variables defined inside the code block in the statement for are not accessible externally.

However, JavaScript uses functions to define variable scopes.

This means that you manage the variables that the function uses in units.

If a variable scope is defined in function units rather than in square brackets, the region variables defined inside the if or for statement code blocks present inside the function use the same variable scope as the region variables defined outside the corresponding code block.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

```js
var a = 1;
function fn() {
if(true) {
var c = 2;
}
return c; // return the variable c defined in the statement block.
}
console.log(fn()); // return 2'
```

Variable c is defined in the if statement block of function fn. And if statement blocks are outside the function code to access c.

JavaScript allows you to access variables defined within any block, as well as if statement blocks or for statement blocks, as in the code above, if inside the same function.

These are characteristics that cannot be seen in other languages.

For example, because variable scopes in languages such as Java and C# are separated by braces, the scope of variables used inside and outside the code block of the if statement is different.

Therefore, you cannot access the variables defined internally from outside the code block of the if statement.

In the code above, variables or functions that are not included in any function, such as variable a, are defined in the global variable scope.

What if we remove var instead of `varc = 2;` inside the if door block and use `c = 2;`?

Without var, the variable is defined at runtime, not parsing.

That is, even if you define a variable within a function, if you define a variable without var, it is dynamically defined in the global scope at runtime.

Therefore, it will become a global variable that can also be used by the external code of fn().

Explore the following code:

```js
function fn() {
g = 'global'; // declared in global scope
}
fn();
console.log(g);
```

The variable g defined inside the function fn will be added as a property g to the global variable scope (Windows object if it is a web browser environment) when the function fn runs.

Defining variables without var is quite risky.

When you create a library for code complexity or independent reuse, it can be a potential bug that prevents code from running normally.

This is because you can use variables with the same name from the outside by accident.

If you are declaring a variable for no particular purpose, it is recommended that you use var explicitly to define a scope that can reference the variable.

### Variable scope object

Now let`s look at the variable scope object.

Take a look at the following simple code:

```js
function fn() {
var a = 1;
return a;
}
console.log(fn()); // 1 반환
```

When a function is invoked and the internal code is parsed, a variable scope for the function fn is defined as follows:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2472104F574514E50F)

When you are now in the execution phase, the code below is executed, and a in the variable scope is assigned 1 and the value when a is returned is 1.

So what is the variable scope? The entity of the variable scope is the object.

Several kinds of variables are added to this variable scope object.

JavaScript functions need to be managed separately from the factors, values, and parameters defined by the actual function call, because the number of parameters defined by the function does not necessarily have to be the same number of parameters.

The factors used to invoke the function and the parameters used to define the function are added separately to the variable scope object of the function.

The var variables that are found through function parsing and the internal function variables that are nested are added to the variable scope object.

For example, the following functions:

```js
// define add
function add(x, y) {
var a = x + y;
return a;
}

// Call add
var r = add(1, 2, 3);
```

When you run add (1,2,3) the variable scope object of the add function is configured first as follows:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/225F784F5745175A28)

The variable scope object, as shown in the figure above, is an object that manages the pair of parameters that have the factor information used to call the function, the parameters that you are using to define the function, and the internal variable (name,value.

When you use a variable in code inside a function, you are the first to search for the current value of that variable in the function`s own variable scope object.

Often, a function`s variable scope tends to think that there are only internal variables.

However, in addition to these internal variables, the variable scope object contains both the parameter defined by the function and the factor value it calls.

All of these variables are called regional variables of the function.

A variable scope object, in other words, is an object that manages the local variables of that function.

Objects in JavaScript can be dynamically added to members, i.e., properties or methods.

When a function is called, JavaScript dynamically creates a variable scope object for that function, adds function factors and parameters, and var variables in turn to complete the variable scope object associated with the function call.

But what happens to variables that do not have var or are not included in any function?

```js
varg1 = "Global variable #1";
function fn() {
g2 = "Global variable#2";
}

```

When you run a program, the variable g1 is first added to a Windows object called the root object, for example, the Web browser environment, in the environment where JavaScript frames are currently running.

Then, when the function fn() is called, g2 is added to the root object at runtime again.

Characteristics of Variable Scope Objects

Let`s look at another feature of the function`s variable scope.

```js
var a = 1;
function fn() {
var b = 1;
return a;
}
console.log(fn()); // 1 반환
exception console.log(b); // b is not defined'
```

The variables declared in the function`s variable scope are not accessible from outside of that function.

In other words, b defined inside fn is not accessible outside of function fn.

### Lexical Properties

The meaning of lexical means "relevant to units and vocabulary" and in JavaScript, the program is related to the implemented "code".

This means that it is related to the situation in the "code" that is defining the function.

When searching for a variable, it is not based on the environment in which the function is executed, but on the context of the code that defined the function.

Explore the following code:

```js
var x = "global";
function fn() {
console.log(x); // does not output "undefined" output, or global
var x = "local"; // declare x variable
console.log(x); // local 출력
}
fn();
```

When executing the above code, you may expect the first `console.log(x)` within the function fn to output `global`.

However, it is output as "undefined".

The above code will first cause global parsing. This parsing defines the global variable x and the function variable fn.

Then running fn() calls the function fn and parsing of the fn level occurs.

As a result of this parsing, x inside the function is defined in the variable scope object of the function fn.

The figure shows how it looks after parsing up to the function fn level.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/264056505745202310)

Parsing Result

When the program starts, a global-level parsing defines the variable scope of the plot`s root (global) object, and when x = `global` is executed during the execution phase and the function fn() is called, parsing the function fn level starts again and at the end of this parsing, defines the local variable x.

After parsing fn, the code block of fn will be executed. That`s how you need to find the value of x to run the first `console.log(x);` that you met, but the question is whether you want to find x in the execution environment or x in the lexical environment.

Find x defined in the variable scope object of fn defined based on the lexical environment, as implied by the "rexic property".

Therefore, the `console.log(x);` we met for the first time will output undefined.

It is not until `x = "local` is executed that the value of x in the variable scope of fn changes to "local".

Let`s take a look at another result caused by the lexical nature of JavaScript.

```js
function f1() {
var a = 1;
f2();
}
function f2() {
return a;
}
console.log(f1()); // an exception named 'a is not defined'
```

Let`s think about the parsing stage.

The global variable scope defines variables (functions) f1, f2. The variable scope of function fn1 defines a, and the variable scope of f2 has no defined variable.

Now let f1() run.

Calling f2 inside f1. When you look at the code in f2, you return variable a.

You search for variable a, which is not found in the execution environment, but in the lexical environment.

That is, where f2 is defined, a does not exist. It is also not in the global variable scope.

This results in an exception that a is not defined.

f2() runs inside f1, but where f2 is defined, there is no variable a.

In other words, you do not search for a in the environment in which the function is running, but for each statement in the defined function.

Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript does not have a rule that a variable must be declared first in code.

Although the variable that the function uses does not exist at the time of defining the function, it only needs to be added to the valid area that the function can access when it runs the program.

If you don`t pay attention to the separation of parsing and execution steps and the presence of a functional, lexical variable scope, you might miss the results you expected.

### Variable scope chain

The unit that determines the variable scope is the function previously a function.

JavaScript allows nested functions, which create parent and child relationships between variable scope objects that are generated per function.

To help you understand, take a look at the following code:

```js
var x = 1;
function outer() {
var y = 2;

function inner() {
var z = 3;
var a = x;
}
}
outer();
```

The function outer is defined and the function inner is defined.

When this code is parsed, it is defined in memory in the following logical constructs:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/214FC94A5745268D37)

Variable scope chain

The figure on the left shows the relationship between the external function and each variable scope object in the internal function in terms of the variable scope object on the right side of the arrow (→) and the variable scope object on the right side of the code.

In the plot, the variable z is the local variable of the function inner, and when code is executed, z, a is the property of the variable scope object of the function inner.

y is the region variable in the outer, which becomes the property of the variable scope object in the outer.

In this situation, let`s look at what happens when the next code inside the function inner runs.

`a = x;` When this code is executed, it searches for variable x first from the variable scope of "the function you are defining, which contains the executable statement a = x;".

This is what I mentioned while explaining the lexical characteristics.

If x is not found in the variable scope of a defined function, it is searched in the variable scope of the superior function outer, which contains that function.

If you don`t find it there, you`ll find x in the global variable scope. If x is not defined there, an error occurs that the variable is not defined.

The relationship between variable scopes is called a variable scope chain.

### Global Object

In this article, we will describe the object representing the global variable scope as a root object.

Note that the root object is sometimes described as a "global object".

However, in other languages, the meaning "global" is also used as a relative meaning of the parent domain.

In other words, the parent region of the current function is all represented as a global region.

To avoid confusion, we will use the term "root" to represent the top parent region of all regions.

This in the code of the global variable scope at runtime allows you to use variables, attributes, and functions defined in the root object.

The following are typical examples of properties and functions defined in the root object:

```js
// Define global properties
this.Infinity
this.undefined
this.NaN
...

// Define embedded objects (embedded constructors)
this.Object = function () { };
this.Array = function () { };
this.Function = function () { };
this.RexExp = function () { };

// Define global function
this.parseInt = function () { };
this.encodeURI = function () { };
this.decodeURI = function () { };
...
```

These embedded objects are functions defined in the global variable scope.

However, you can omit this when using functions and attributes defined in the global variable scope in code.

In fact, in a global execution environment, if you declare variables in a top-level region that does not belong to any function other than the region of the function, they are all added as properties and methods of the root object.

```js
var a = 1, b = 2;
this.prop1 = "a";
function init(obj) {
var c;
}
```

a, b, and prop1, init are all added as attributes and methods of the root object as variables defined in the global region that do not belong to any function.

`this.prop1 = "a";` is this, the code that adds the property prop1 to the root object and assigns a value of "a".

In the global execution environment area, whether you define a variable by attaching a var to it or not, there is no difference in that the object to which the variable is defined is a global variable scope object.

The root object in a web page execution environment is a Window object that can be accessed through Windows in code.

Therefore, in the code of the global region, this and Window refer to the same object.

The following comparison expression returns patient:

```js
console.log(this === window); // true 를 반환
```

For your information, the root object does not have a constructor

You cannot create objects by invoking them like `new Window()` in JavaScript code.
