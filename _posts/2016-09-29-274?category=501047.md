Modernizer and Media Query Utilization

If you have looked around Modernizer and Detectizer in the previous article, you would think you should use it at least once.

In particular, it will bring a great advantage if it is necessary to build a reactive web (RWD) in the current domestic trend.

In this article, we will learn how to cope with RWD in the domestic environment by using Modernizer.

### Before using Media Query

Generally, it seems that RWD is not suitable for the environment in Korea.

Of course, it`s appropriate for a small site, but it`s never appropriate for a site with a lot of content, but the client tries to fulfill that demand and we have to accept it.

Also, RWD is a technology that responds to design as it can be seen in word semantics and more specifically depends on the device.

However, the client does not stop here and requires the design to respond even if the windows on the desktop are resized.

If you ask, "Isn`t it natural that the design should change if you do window resizing?" you need to think differently.

For example, not only the modernizer you want to do now, but also any existing libraries do not check devices when resizing.

However, because the media query responds to the media size, it only reacts when resizing in Windows, but if you call it RWD (Reponsive Web Design), you are mistaken.

If you understand that, RWD should be Resize Web Design.

But what if the client is persuaded like this, but what if not?

It will take the trouble of just working with mid-warquery, and the breaking point may become complicated depending on the number of devices.

For many of these reasons, with the help of Modernizer and Detectizer, you will be able to create a much easier project environment, as well as the client`s requirements.

### Modernizr.mq()

Please refer to the previous information on how to use the modernizer.

Check Modernizr.mq() among the optional values of the modifier to download the modifier and include the script.

And detectizr is a necessary and sufficient condition depending on your environment.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" class="no-js">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Modernizr.mq()</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"/>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="modernizr.js"></script>
</head>
```

Encloud the modifier that checked the mq item as shown above.

Modernizr.mq() is available in the same way as the CSS media query syntax and can check (detect) media queries equally.

```js
if (Modernizr.mq('only screen and (min-width: 960px)')) {
$('body').addClass('desktop');
}
```

Use the above syntax to specify breaking points based on the project environment and configure classes to be added to the body element of a web page.

The caveat here is that you will check the media query every time it is resizing, which will cause performance issues to appear.

As a solution to this, we will use the thrashing technique.

Throttling will cause performance degradation, for example, a large amount of "scroll events" that cannot be seen during window scrolling, each time something needs to be compared. And there will be a lot of resize events here.

This means that to avoid this performance degradation, it is effective not to run the event handler as it is every time an event occurs, but to a certain extent, to make it run at a limited frequency.

The processing that limits the number of executions of these event handlers is called "throwling."

The example below uses a plug-in called jQuery.throttle-debounce to realize thrashing.

For example, if you specify (1000/15) as shown below, the event handler does not run more than 15 times a second, even if scroll events occur frequently.

```js
$(window).on('scroll', $.throttle(1000 / 15, function () {
// Skip
}));
```

First, make sure that the throttle library is included in the `head`.

```undefined
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" class="no-js">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Modernizr.mq()</title>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"/>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="modernizr.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.throttle-debounce.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

To add desktop, tablet, and mobile class names to the `body` element using the above throttle considering performance optimization, the following configuration is made:

```js
var $body = $('body'),
isClass = null;
function mqDetect() {
if(isClass != null) {
$body.removeClass(isClass);
}
if (Modernizr.mq('only screen and (min-width: 960px)')) {
$body.addClass('desktop');
} else if (Modernizr.mq('only screen and (min-width: 600px)')) {
$body.addClass('tablet');
} else {
$body.addClass('mobile');
}

isClass = $body.attr('class');
};
mqDetect();

$(window).on('resize', $.throttle(1000 / 15, function(){
mqDetect();
}));
```

Please check the class name of body while resizing the window window on the user page with the code above.
