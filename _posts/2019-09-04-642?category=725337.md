In the Function part, we will learn more about the following different concepts related to the function:

- Function generation and scope
- variable hoisting, scope
- Function object
- Different function types
- Function call and this
- Prototype and prototype chaining

To create a function

The most important concept in JavaScript is definitely a function.
The function in JavaScript provides the same functionality as any other programming language at first glance.
It`s like writing a code that provides a particular function, defining a function, and invoking it to get the result. However, in addition to these functions, JavaScript functions provide many of the fundamental functions of JavaScript, such as modular processing, closure, and object creation.

### Function Definition

There are three ways to create a function in JavaScript.
These methods all produce the same function, but the behavior of the function varies subtly depending on each method.

- Function() constructor function (=Function() object)
- Function statement
- function expression

#1-1 Function() Generating a function with the generator function

The function of JavaScript can also be seen as an object generated by a built-in constructor function called `Function().

A function is a collection of code statements to be called using parentheses (), and you can pass parameters in parentheses when you run the function, making it accessible to a specific value in the sentence within the function.

The syntax for generating a function with the `Fucntion()` constructor function is as follows:

```js
new Function(arg1, arg2, ...argN, functionBody)
>> arg1, arg2, ...argN : Parameters of the function
>> functionBody : String containing code to execute when function is called

```

The add() function created using the above syntax is as follows:

```js
var add = new Function('x', 'y', 'return x + y');

console.log( add(3, 4) ); // 7
```

#1-2 Function() Parameters

The Function() constructor can have parameters indefinitely, but the last parameter must always be a string representing the code to configure the body of the function. Other parameters passed to the constructor are available within the function and must be comma-separated between parameters when passing multiple parameters.

```js
var calc = new Function('x, y, z', 'return (x + y) * z');
console.log( calc( 3, 4, 2 ) ); // 14
```

Because these methods of generating functions using the `Function()` constructor functions are not frequently used, these grammar may occur when analyzing sources created by others rather than actually being used, so it would be good to know them as common sense.
So what grammar is more frequently used than Function() constructor function?!
If you have ever experienced JavaScript, you may be using function declarations and function expressions.
Just as you can create regular objects in the object literal way you learned earlier, JavaScript can use function literals to create functions.
In other words, function literals, like object literals, provide a grammar that can easily define functions with short notation in JavaScript. In fact, both the function declaration and the function expression method generate the function in this function literal way.

#2 Creating a Function in a Function Declaration Method

The function declaration method is the same as the function literal form described earlier.
The caveat here is that for functions defined by a function declaration method, a function name (function name) must be defined.

The following code is a code that implements the function `multiple()` in the form of a function declaration, which also calls the function with this function name:

```js
function multiple(x, y) {
return x * y;
}

console.log(multiple(4,5)); // 20

```

In summary, the function declaration is shown below.

#3-1 Generate functions in a function expression

In JavaScript, functions are treated as one value.
The JavaScript function is called a top-level object because of the characteristics that are treated as these values, and we will deal with this later.
Therefore, it is possible to assign functions treated as values to variables such as numbers or strings.

Therefore, the function expression is called function expression by assigning functions generated by function literals to variables.

The following example is an add() function in the form of a function expression, which creates a function that adds two values to the function literal, and then stores it in the add variable. And here, the function generated by the function literal has no function name, so it is an anonymous function.

```js
// add() Create function (function expression)
var add = function (x, y) {
return x + y;
};

console.log(add(3, 4)); // 7

var plus = add;
console.log(plus(5, 6)); //11

```

As you can see from the previous example code, the function expression is almost identical to the function declaration syntax. The only difference is that the function name is optional in the function expression method, which is not usually used. If you are using a function name in a function expression, we will look at it again.

Note that the `add` variable in the code above is a variable that references a function generated by a function literal, not a function name used in a function declaration. In this posting, we will refer to variables assigned functions as function variables, such as `add`.

The function variable add has the reference value of the function, so you can assign it to another variable plus. This is why code adding two values as a plus function variable in `var plus = add;` can be performed properly. Please remember the characteristics of the reference values we learned earlier.

And as you can see above, you need to use a function variable to call a function generated by the function expression.

Since the function variable in the code above is `add`, it is possible to call the function with `add(3, 4).

Since `plus` is also a function variable that references the same function as the add function variable, it is possible to call the function in the same form as `plus(5, 6).

As we discussed earlier, this unnamed form of function is called an anonymous function in JavaScript.

That is, the previous example code will create an anonymous function that adds two numbers that are passed over to the factor and assign them to the add variable.

This is the function expression method (anonymous function expression) using an anonymous function.

In summary, the function expression is shown in the picture below.

#3-2 Calling functions in a named function expression

A named function expression is a function expression but has a name. In other words, a function expression containing a function name is called a named function expression. There is something to be careful about when using these signature function expressions.

Let`s take a look at the following code:

```js
var add = function sum(x, y) {
return x + y;
};

console.log(add(3, 4)); // 7
console.log(sum(3,4)); // sum is not defined error occurred

```

The above code was analyzed to define the `sum()` function and assigned it to the add function variable. What is unusual about this example is that the result value of a `add()` function call is returned successfully, while an error occurs when a `sum()` function call is called.

This is because the function name used in the function expression is not accessible from the external code.

In practice, a function name such as `sum` used in a function expression is used to recursively call the function within the function (body), or to distinguish the function from the debugger. This results in an error that the function `sum()` is not defined when calling the function outside the function with the sum used as the function name.

So how can functions defined by the function declaration method described above be called outside the function by the function name?

This is because the code written in the function declaration is changed to the following function expression form by the JavaScript engine as shown below.

```js
// Function declaration method
function add(x, y) {
return x + y;
}

// Changed to expression internally by JavaScript engine
var add = function add(x, y) {
return x + y;
}

```

Since the function name and function variable have the same name as `add`, it appears that the function is called by the function name, but in reality, it is possible to call outside the function with the add function variable.

As already mentioned, the function name is optional in the function expression, but these function names allow recursive call processing of the function with the function name inside the function code.

The following example is a code that makes a recursive call of a function by the name of the function in a named function expression.

```js
var factorilVar = function factorial(n) {
if(n <=1 ) {
return 1;
}
// debugger;
return n * factorial(n-1);
};

console.log( factorilVar( 3 ) ); // 6
// console.log( factorial( 3 ) ); // factorial is not defined 에러 발생
```

A function that recursively invokes and implements the factory value in a function expression as shown above.

Outside the function, the function was called with the function variable factorilVar, and you can see that recursive calls made inside the function are treated with the `factorial` function name. As described earlier, an error occurred because the function could not be called outside the function with the function name `factual()`.

#4 Compare Function Declaration with Function Expression

The information I explained above is as shown in the picture below.

### Conclusion

So we`ve learned three ways to create a function in JavaScript. You can see that the codes are slightly different, but they all produce functions of the same function. But there`s a slight difference in how they behave. One of the reasons is Hoisting.

In the next posting, we will look at the information related to hoisting.
