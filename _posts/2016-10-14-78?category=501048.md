Module Pattern

Learn about modularity and module patterns.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/232FC33F57EC8FB40B)

Before we begin to learn about this concept, let`s briefly talk about private variables and privileged members.

Unlike other languages such as Java, JavaScript does not have a separate syntax for private, protected, public properties and methods.

All members of an object are public, that is, public.

In other words, JavaScript does not have the concept of a private member, and the properties of the object are all public.

However, the concept of `unique variables` exists.

For example, variables defined within a function cannot be accessed outside of the function, so they are all considered private variables.

These eigenfunctions include parameters of the function, local variables, and internal functions.

Below, we will first learn more about the namespace patterns that we found in Module Pattern #1 and continue to learn about the above mentioned points.

### Universal namespace function to help you create namespace patterns

As the complexity of the program increases and each part of the code is separated into separate files and optionally included in the document, it is dangerous to assume that a code first defines a particular namespace or property within it.

The property that you are trying to add to the namespace may already exist and the content may be overwritten.

Therefore, it is best to determine whether it already exists before creating a namespace or adding a property.

Let`s take a look at the following examples:

```js
It's dangerous.
var MYAPP = {};

// Improvement Plan
if (typeof MYAPP === 'undefined') {
MYAPP = {};
}

// or write shorter.
var MYAPP = MYAPP || {};
```

This additional verification can result in a significant amount of duplicate code.

For example, to define MYAPP.modules.module2, you must verify each step`s object and property, resulting in three duplicate codes.

Therefore, it is convenient to create reusable functions that are responsible for the actual work of namespace generation.

The following example implements a namespace function.

The following methods do not break existing code because they do not overwrite the namespace if it exists:

```js
var MYAPP = MYAPP || {};

MYAPP.namespace = function (ns_string) {
var parts = ns_string.split('.'),
parent = MYAPP,
i;

// initially remove duplicate global object names.
if (parts[0] === 'MYAPP') {
parts = parts.slice(1);
}

for (i = 0; i < parts.length; i += 1) {
if (typeof parent[parts[i]] === 'undefined') {
parent[parts[i]] = {};
}
parent = parent[parts[i]];
}

return parent;

};
```

This code is available in all of the following examples:

```js
var module2 = MYAPP.namespace('MYAPP.modules.module2');
console.log(module2);
console.log(module2 === MYAPP.modules.module2); // true 가 기록

// 'MYAPP' in the first part can be omitted.
MYAPP.namespace('modules.module10');

// create a very long namespace.
MYAPP.namespace('once.upon.a.time.there.was.this.long.nested.property');

console.log(MYAPP);
```

The following illustration shows the example above when the `MYAPP` was actually tested with the element tester.

### Declaration of Dependency

Because JavaScript libraries are usually modularized by specifying a namespace, you can select only the modules that you need.

For example, YUI2 has a global variable called YAHOO that acts as a namespace, and a module such as YAHO.util.DOM (DOM Module) or YAHOO.util.Event is added as a property of this global variable.

It is recommended that you declare a dependent module at the top of the function or module.

That is, create a region variable and declare it to point to the module.

```js
var myFunction = function () {
// modules in dependency
var event = YAHOO.util.Event,
dom = YAHOO.util.Dom;

// now use the variables event and dom...

};
```

It`s a very simple pattern, but it has many advantages.

- Because dependencies are explicitly declared, code users can see which script files must be included within the page.
- It is easy to find and understand dependencies because they are declared at the beginning of the function.
- Regional variables such as dom are always faster than global variables such as YAHOO, and not to mention compared to nested properties of global variables such as YAHOO.util.Dom. Keeping a good dependency declaration pattern makes global object discrimination within a function only once, and then using local variables, which is much faster.

### Private Member

```js
function add(num1, num2) {
var sum = num1 + num2;
return sum;
}
```

There are three distinct variables, num1, num2 and sum, in the above code. These variables are accessible inside the function, but not outside the function.

There is no separate grammar for private members, but it can be implemented using a closure.

When a closure is created within a constructor function, variables within the effective range of the closure are not exposed outside the constructor function, but can be written within the object`s public method. Closures are created and used within functions to allow access to these variables through a chain of scope.

In other words, when returning an object from a constructor, the method of the object is defined, which allows access to private variables.

```js
function Gadget(){
// Private member
var name = 'iPod';

// a function (privatized member)
this.getName = function(){
return name;
};
}

var toy = new Gadget();

// 'name' is private and undefined is printed.
console.log(toy.name);

// Public methods allow access to 'name'.
console.log(toy.getName());
```

As you can see, JavaScript can easily implement private members.

It just needs to wrap data that will be kept private as a function.

When these data are made into local variables of the function, they are not accessible outside the function.

### Privileged method

Using the above code techniques, a common method can be created to allow access to eigenfunctions outside of a function, which is called a privileged methods.

In other words, the privileged method is a common method with access to unique variables/functions.

The privileged method is just a name that refers to a public method that has access to a private member.

In the previous example, getName() is a privileged method because it has `special` access to the private property name.

### Disclosure member's loophole

If the privileged method returns the value of a private variable immediately, the value of the private variable can be modified in the external code because if the variable is an object or array, it returns a non-value reference.

```js
function Gadget(){
// Private Members
var specs = {
screen_width : 320,
screen_height : 480,
color : "white"
};

// Public function
this.getSpecs = function(){
return specs;
};
}

var toy = new Gadget(),
specs = toy.getSpecs();

specs.color = "black";
specs.price = "free";

console.log(toy.getSpecs());
//Object {screen_width: 320, screen_height: 480, color: "black", price: "free"}
```

At first glance, it does not seem to be a problem, but here the getSpec() method returns a reference to the specs object.

Specs appear to be a hidden private member, but may be changed by Gadget users.

To address these unexpected problems, care must be taken when passing references to objects or arrays that must be kept private, and can be solved with extend() functions that copy only the top-level properties of a given object and extendDeep() functions that recursively copy all nested properties.

There are many ways to create privileged methods on objects, but in this posting, let`s find out how to use privileged methods by looking at modularity and module patterning.

### Modularity (capsules)

```js
'// global scope
// Variable (member variable)
// var sayHi = "안녕";

// Functional Area
/*
var moduleFunc = function() {
// Function scope (new zone created)
};
*/

// create one code block of the above member variables and functional regions
// That is, the code above is globally defined, but the member variables and functional regions are independent of the global scope.
// modularize to create and manage one new range.

// New modularity (capsule)
// self-execution function
(function(){

var sayHi = "안녕";

var moduleFunc = function() {
return sayHi;
};

console.log (moduleFunc()); // function called in the same scope

}); // Immediate Run Function

// Call from outside
// console.log(sayHi); // Uncaught ReferenceError: sayHi is not defined
// console.log(moduleFunc()) // Uncaught ReferenceError: moduleFunc is not defined
```

### Module Pattern

The module pattern devised by Douglas Crockford does the same thing in a single tone.

A singleton is an object intended to have only one instance. Traditionally, JavaScript uses object literal notation to create singletones, as shown in the following code.

```js
var singleton = {
name: value,
method : function() {
// Method Code
}
}
```

### Object Literals and Private Members

Non-disclosure members can be implemented as object literals rather than constructors.

In object literal, an anonymous immediate execution function is added to create a closure.

The module pattern extends the default singleton according to the above code format, allowing the use of a private member and a privileged method.

```js
'var myobj;// assign objects to this variable.
(function(){
// Private Members
var name = "my, oh my";

// implement parts to be disclosed.
// Do not use var.
myobj = {
//Privileged Method
getName : function(){
return name;
}
};
}());

myobj.getName();
```

Alternatively, it can be implemented as follows:

```js
var myobj = (function(){
// Private Members
var name = "my, oh my";

// implement parts to be disclosed.
return {
//Privileged Method
getName : function(){
return name;
}
};
}());

myobj.getName();
```

Let`s write more codes and review them.

```js
var myObj = function(){

// Scope to be a private member
"Hello!!!"";
var intCnt = 0;
var hi = function() {
intCnt += 1; // increase by 1 each time the hi function is called
return sayHi;
};

var cnt = function() {
Return intCnt; // allows an increased intCnt value to be returned through closure.
}


// Privilege/Public Method and Property (Public Interface)=>Role to disclose outside
// Return an object literal as a function value (the returned object literal has only the properties and methods that will be public)
return {
getHi : function() {
return sayHi; // access to unique members (privileged method)
},
getHi2 : function() {
'Nice to meet you~'!';
},
getHi3 : hi,
If getCnt : intCnt, // intCnt is returned directly to the outside, the increased value is not output.
getCnt2 : cnt
}
}();

// function calls are possible outside of the module pattern because the object literal is handed over to the return value.
// This is called the public method because it is available externally.
console.log(myObj.getHi());
console.log(myObj.getHi2());
console.log(myObj.getHi3());
console.log(myObj.getCnt);
console.log(myObj.getCnt2());
console.log(myObj.getHi3());
console.log(myObj.getCnt2());
```

Thus, the module pattern uses an anonymous function that returns the object.

Within an anonymous function, the first is to define the parameters, region variables, and functions of the function, which are distinct members, and then return the object literals as function values.

The returned object literal contains only the properties or methods to be used publicly, and the object is defined within an anonymous function, so the common method is accessible to its own members.

In other words, object literals define the public interface for singletones.

### Prototype and Private Members

When creating a private member using a constructor, the disadvantage is that each time a constructor is called to create a new object, the private member is recreated every time.

In fact, this problem always occurs when members are added to this inside the constructor

To eliminate this redundancy and save memory, you must add common properties and methods to the prototype property of the constructor.

This ensures that all instances created with the same constructor share a common part.

Hidden private members can also be used by all instances.

This requires two patterns: a pattern of creating private members inside the constructor function and a pattern of creating private members with object literals.

This is because the prototype property is also an object and can be created as an object literal.

```js
function Gadget() {
// Private Members
var name = 'iPod';

// Public function
this.getName = function () {
return name;
}
}

Gadget.prototype = (function () {
// Private Members
var browser = 'Mobile Webkit';

// published prototype members
return {
getBrowser : function () {
return browser;
}
}

})();

var toy = new Gadget();
console.log(toy.getName()); // privileged method of object instance
console.log(toy.getBrowser()); // privileged method of prototype'
```

### To expose a private function as a public method

An exposure pattern is an implementation of a private method while also exposing it as a public method.

All of the functions of the object are essential to what the object does, so you need maximum protection, and at the same time, you may want to allow public access because of the usefulness of these functions.

Exposure patterns can be useful in such cases.

The fact that a method is public means that it is eventually at risk.

This is because public API users can unintentionally modify the method.

ECMAScript 5 has a selector to freeze objects, but not earlier versions.

Now let`s find out about the exposure pattern of exposure.

The term was coined by Christian Heilmann and was initially referred to as the `revealing module pattern`.

Let`s look at the example first.

This example is based on a pattern of creating private members within an object literal.

```js
var arr;

(function(){

var astr = '[object Array]';
var toString = Object.prototype.toString;

function isArray(a) {
return toString.call(a) === astr;
}

function indexOf(haystack, needle) {
var i = 0,
max = haystack.length;
for (; i < max; i += 1) {
if (haystack[i] === needle ) {
return i;
}
}
return -1;
}

arr = {
isArray : isArray,
indexOf : indexOf,
inArray : indexOf
}

})();
```

There are two private variables and two private functions, `isArray()` and `indexOf()`.

If you look at the last part of the immediate execution function, the functions that you decide are okay to allow public access can be filled in the arr object.

The private function indexOf() is exposed with two names: indexOf, the name of the ECMAScript expression 5, and the name affected by PHP, inArray.

Based on the code defined above, try to task the new arr object.

```js
arr.isArray([1, 2]); // true writes
arr.isArray ({0:1}); // false writes
arr.indexOf (['a', 'b', 's'], 's'); // 2 is logged
arr.inArray (['a', 'b', 's'], 's'); // 2 is logged'
```

Now even if something unexpected happens to the released method `indexOf(), `inArray()` will continue to work well because the private function `indexOf()` is secure.

```js
arr.indexOf = null;
arr.inArray (['a', 'b', 'z', 'z']); // Record 2'
```

Module Pattern Cleanup

Module patterns are widely used because they help you structure and organize your growing code.

Unlike other languages, JavaScript does not have a separate grammar for the package.

However, module patterns allow for loose coupling of individual codes.

This allows you to treat each feature like a black box while also adding, replacing, or deleting features as required during software development (continuously changing).

The module pattern is a combination of the following patterns we have identified so far!!

- Namespace Pattern
- Immediate Run Function
- Private and privileged members
- Declaration of Dependency

The first step is to set up a namespace.

Using the `namespace()` function, which was found in the top article above, create an example of a utility module that provides useful array methods.

```js
MYAPP.namespace('MYAPP.utilities.array');
```

The next step is to define a module. If you need to limit disclosure, you can create a private effective range using the Immediate Run function.

The Immediate Run function returns the object to be a module.

This object will contain an open interface to be provided to module users.

```js
MYAPP.utilities.array = function () {
return {
inArray : function (needle, haystack) {
// ...
},
isArray : function (a) {
// ...
}
}
}();
```

The immediate execution function`s private effective range allows you to declare private properties and methods freely.

If a module is dependent, it is defined at the top of the Immediate Run function.

After you declare a variable, you may want to have the one-time initialization code required to initialize the module as needed.

The final result returned by the immediate execution function is an object containing the module`s public API.

```js
MYAPP.namespace('MYAPP.utilities.array');

MYAPP.utilities.array = function () {

// Declaration of Dependency
var uobj = MYAPP.utilities.object,
ulang = MYAPP.utilities.lang;

// Private Properties
var array_string = '[object Array]',
ops = Object.prototype.toString;

// Private Methods
// ...

// execute a one-time initialization procedure if necessary.
// ...

// Public API
return {
inArray : function (needle, haystack) {
for (var i = 0, max = haystack.length; i < max; i += 1) {
if (haystack[i] === needle ) {
return true;
}
}
},
isArray : function (a) {
return ops.call(a) === array_string;
}
// ... More necessary methods and properties can be added here.
}
}();
```

The module pattern is a highly recommended method, especially when it is widely used to clean up increasing numbers of code.

In the next posting, we will continue to learn about module exposure patterns, modules that generate generators, and sandbox patterns.
