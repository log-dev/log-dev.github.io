Receiving commands from the shell to the keyboard is called standard input, and outputting the execution results of commands entered by the keyboard to the monitor is called standard output.

### I/O redirection

The shell can save the results of a command to a file without outputting it to a monitor, which uses redirection. Redirection can be used to specify the direction of the output and input.

| Redirection symbol | Direction | Meaning |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| \> | Standard Output | Command > File : Save the results of the command to a file |
| \>> | Standard Output (Add) | Command >> File : Add Command Results to Existing File Data |
| < | Standard Input | Command < File : Enter data from file into command |

Other redirection symbols are used as follows.

- Command >
- Commands >>
- Command >! File name: Outputs the results of standard output generated and commanded to a file, regardless of the existence of the file.
- Command >
- Command >>! File name: Create and add to file output regardless of whether file exists or not
- Commands >>
- Command A | Command B : Run using the output from Command A as the Command B input
- Command A |

### File Detector

Standard inputs, standard outputs, and standard errors can also be expressed numerically in shell or system programming, which is called file descriptors.

/dev/null is a null file with a value of zero and means to redirect the standard error (2) to the standard output (1).
