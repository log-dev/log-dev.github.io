### Introducing html5shiv

Originally developed by John Resig and completed by Remi Sharp (?not accurate) JavaScript, it is a library that allows new HTML5 segmentation elements to work with previous versions of IE6–9, Safari 4.x (iPhone 3.x) and Firefox 3.x.

If you stop by the GitHub repository above, you can explain and download it in detail (of course, in English), and simply organize what you need underneath.

Briefly describe the downloaded file.

It includes `document.createElement` and `document.createDocumentFragmenter` with monkeypatches for basic `createElement()` technology and application of technology in IE6–8. It also provides basic styling for IE6-9, Safari 4.x and FF 3.x.

Everything in the html5shiv.js file and when printed in IE6–8, include a mechanism to allow new elements of HTML5 to have style and children.

### How to use html5shiv

Select the file to be used in the list folder of the downloaded file and apply it to the `head` part as shown below.

```html
<head>
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="경로명/html5shiv.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
</head>

```

If this code is used, the corresponding block elements should be `display:block` in the CSS.

```css
article, aside, details, figcaption, figure, footer, header, hgroup, main, nav, section, summary {display: block;}

```

If Modernizr is used, html5shiv can be included in the core.

### html5shiv Known Issues and Limitations

- The `ShivMethods` option (document.createElement) and `html5.createElement` method create an unseparable element with parent node (check #64).
- The problem with clone nodes is currently a problem that is not resolved by HTML5 Shiv. HTML5 elements can be dynamically generated, but not replicated in all cases.
- The printshiv version of HTML5 Shiv changes the print style and the entire DOM of the print. This can lead to performance and style problems when having complex websites or large amounts of print styles. The solution is to use htc-branch in HTML5 Shiv, another technology that implements print styles for IE6–8.
