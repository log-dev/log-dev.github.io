This is the main purpose

The main purpose of creating instances with new operators and constructor functions is to set and maintain different values for each generated instance.

Example code to set and maintain values for each instance using this keyword

```js
var title = function(opt) {
this.opt = opt;
};

title.prototype = {
getValue: function() {
return this.opt;
}
}

// Create Instance
var one = new title(100);
var two = new title([200,300]);
one.opt = 77;

console.log(one.getValue()); // 77
console.log(two.getValue()); // [200, 300]
```

When the new title (100); constructor function is executed, it is set to the property of the instance created by 100 passed over to the parameter.

Therefore, you can set values for each instance.

Setting a value for an instance in the instance method gives you access to this in other methods that belong to the same instance.

The generated instance references and shares the property associated with the title.prototype.

This is the main purpose of generating instances, and the main purpose of this.

Assigning 77 to the opt property of the above code one.opt = 77; one instance is only set to one instance, but not to two instances.

Thus, changing the value of one instance does not affect the two instances.

Use this keyword in an instance is to have a different value for each instance.
