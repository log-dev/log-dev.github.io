JS : prototype constructor inheritance

In this posting, you will learn about the code that inherits the constructor and steals the constructor.

### prototype constructor inheritance

Let`s take a look at the following example code:

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
this.length = length;
this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype = {
getArea : function () {
return this.length * this.width;
},
toString: function () {
return "[Rectangle : " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
}
};

// inherits from Rectangle
function Square(size) {
this.length = size;
this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype = new Rectangle();
Square.prototype.constructor = Square;

Square.prototype.toString = function () {
return "[Square : " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
};

var rect = new Rectangle(5, 10);
var square = new Square(6);

console.log(rect.getArea()); // 50
console.log(square.getArea()); // 36

console.log(rect.toString()); // [Rectangle : 5x10]
console.log(square.toString()); // [Square : 6x6]

console.log(rect instanceof Rectangle); // true
console.log(rect instanceof Object); // true

console.log(square instanceof Square); // true
console.log(square instanceof Rectangle); // true
console.log(square instanceof Object); // true
```

This code has two generators, Rectangle and Square.

The prototype property of the Square constructor is set by an instance of Rectangle` (Square.prototype = new Rectangle();).

No arguments were required when setting to this point, so no arguments were passed to the Rectangle.

If you used this argument, all Square instances would have been set to the same size.

When changing the prototype chain in this way, the constructor must be carefully written to prevent errors from occurring without any arguments being passed (many constructors must be passed on), and the constructor must not modify any kind of global state.

An example can be to track the number of instances created using global variables, and so on.

The `constructor` property must be overwritten and returned to its original value.

After this process, create an instance of Rectangle, correct, and square, which is an instance of Square.

Both objects have a method called getArea() inherited from Rectangle.prototype.

The square variable is also an instance of Square and an instance of Rectangle and Object.

Because the `instanceof` operator uses a prototype chain to determine the type of object, this variable appears as an instance of three types.

In fact, `Square.prototype` does not necessarily have to be redefined as a Rectangle object, but it does not have to do anything unnecessary to Square in the Rectangle constructor.

`Square.prototype` and `Rectangle.prototype` are only connected to show how inheritance occurs.

Therefore, using `Object.create()` may make the above example simpler.

```js
Inherit the Rectangle.
function Square(size) {
this.length = size;
this.width = size;
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype, {
constructor : {
configurable : true,
enumerable : true,
value : Square,
writable : true
}
});

Square.prototype.toString = function () {
return "[Square : " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
};
```

In this code, `Square.prototype` was assigned a new object that inherited `Rectangle.prototype` and the Rectangle constructor was never called.

In other words, if you call this constructor without an argument, you don`t have to worry about the error.

Nevertheless, this code behaves exactly like the one we saw earlier.

Because the prototype chain remains intact, all instances of Square inherit `Rectangle.prototype` and the `constructor` property of the instance is well restored.

### constructor stealing

Because inheritance in JavaScript is done through prototypes, you do not need to invoke the object`s parent type constructor.

To call a higher type of `generator` from a lower type of `generator`, you need to understand and use JavaScript`s behavior.

You can use the `call()` and `apply()` methods that make you use different `this` values when you invoke the function.

The same is true of constructor steering.

You can invoke the parent type constructor by using call() or apply() in the child type constructor and passing the newly created object as an argument.

The following example is a code that steals a parent type constructor from a self-created object.

```js
function Rectangle(length, width) {
this.length = length;
this.width = width;
}

Rectangle.prototype.getArea = function () {
return this.length * this.width;
};

Rectangle.prototype.toString = function () {
return "[Rectangle " + this.length + "*" + this.width + "]";
};

// Inherit from Rectangle.
function Square(size) {
Rectangle.call(this, size, size);

// Here you can define a new property or rewrite an existing one.
}

Square.prototype = Object.create(Rectangle.prototype, {
constructor : {
configurable : true,
enumerable : true,
value : Square,
writable : true
}
});

Square.prototype.toString = function () {
return "[Square : " + this.length + "x" + this.width + "]";
};

var square = new Square(7);

console.log(square.length); // 7
console.log(square.width); // 7
console.log(square.getArea()); // 49
```

The `Square` constructor called the `Rectangle` constructor and used size as two arguments at the same time as this (one is stored in length and the other in width).

This creates a new object with the value of length and width property equal to size.

This method prevents you from redefining the properties defined by the constructor you want to inherit.

You can add a new property or modify an existing property after calling the parent type constructor.

Running the constructor in these two steps can be useful when inheritance occurs between two objects that you create.

You may always need to modify the prototype of the constructor, but you may also need to call the parent constructor together within the subtype constructor.

Typically, prototype inheritance is used for method inheritance and constructor steal is often used for property inheritance.

This method mimics class inheritance in a class-based language, which is called pseudo-pseudoclassical inheritance.
