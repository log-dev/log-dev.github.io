We often imagine what kind of box it will look like in our heads while applying CSS. Organize the relevant points so that the form can be drawn correctly.

The box model defines how elements are rendered in box form with the design patterns underlying the CSS. Box models are inline, inline-block, block, table, absolute position, float.

The width and height properties set the inner box size of the element. There is a padding around the inner box, a border around the padding, and a margin around the border. The box around the margin is the outer box.

The outer box grows due to padding, border, and margin, but the width and height of the inner box do not change. Specifying a negative value for margin may cause adjacent elements to overlap, but the width and height do not change.

### Inline box

Inline boxes are called inline, inline elements, and static inline boxes. The inline box is automatically wrapped into a new row when the width of the parent element is exceeded.

- Width, height, overflow: These properties do not apply to inline elements. This is because the width and height are automatically reduced according to the contents in it.
- Margin, line-height: Horizontal margins of margin properties operate, and margin-top and margin-bottom are not applied. Line-height should be used for up and down spacing.
- Border, padding: When the top and bottom borders are specified, the line spacing is stretched or the longitudinal position of the inline element remains unchanged, showing the border above and below the padding area. The border does not affect the line spacing, so if you do not specify a larger value for line-height, the border may overlap the border of the front and back lines. The padding properties are the same.
- The inline element cannot be aligned outside the parent element. Static block elements or float elements cannot be aligned at the outer top/bottom of the parent element. IE6 does not have the ability to externally align static block elements and float elements, and is in IE7 and later versions.
- When decorating inline elements, `<span class="deco">
- To render block elements like inline elements, specify `display:inline`. Specifying this rule for any element will display it as an inline element, but the margin value and padding value will be applied differently in the inline element, so this needs to be adjusted. When a list item is displayed inline, the bullies and numbers are not displayed. Chrome browser versions 8 and later require a value of "display: inline-table" in a table to render the table like an inline element.

### Inline-block box

Inline block boxes are subject to inline flow, but like block boxes, margin, border, padding, width, and height properties are applied. Automatic shrinkage, designated size, and automatic expansion are possible without overlapping lines.

- width, height : Specifies the width and height of the element. If `display: inline-block` is specified for inline elements, the desired width and height can be set. To automatically shrink according to the content, `width: auto` and `height: auto` can be specified. `width: 100%` is designated to automatically expand according to parent`s element. Auto-zooming inline block elements equates to block elements.
- The margin:margin property applies differently to inline block elements. Specifying a positive value for the margin-top property increases the line spacing, while specifying a negative value decreases the line spacing. Specifying a positive value for the margin-bottom property raises the element and lowers the element when specifying a negative value. Of course, the margin-bottom property can also increase or decrease line spacing. If you specify a positive value for the margin-left property, it falls from the front element, and if you specify a negative value, it approaches the front element. If you specify a positive value for the margin-right property, the next element is pushed away, and if you specify a negative value, the next element is pulled close.
- Border, padding: Specifying borders and padding increases the size outside the inline element. The element itself and its contents are pushed to the right, and the element is raised and the line spacing containing the element is increased.
- Vertical-align: The inline-block element is influenced by the vertical-align property.(Maybe you want to set this property to top.)

IE6 and 7 are not supported, so the nucleus `*display: inline; zoom: 1;` is used together to make it recognised.

```css
.inline-block { display:inline-block; *display:inline; zoom:1; }

```

### Block box

They are called blocks, block elements, and static block boxes. Blocks can be automatically enlarged to match the width and height of the parent element, or smaller or larger than the parent element. Specifying the size of the block element larger than the parent element causes it to overflow out of the parent element. The overflow attribute lets you specify how to handle the overflow.

- Width: The default is `width: auto`, where the element extends to the width of the parent element.
- Height: The default is `height: auto`, where the element is reduced to match the noopy of all child block elements.
- margin-left, margin-right: insert or write the left and right sides of an auto-expanding block element to place a gap between the left and right sides of a sizing block element. Automatic horizontal reduction is not applied to the block box.
- margin-left: auto, margin-right: auto: sets the horizontal position alignment of the specified size block element. If you resize a block element by specifying a size in the width property, specifying `margin-right:auto` will align the block element to the left of the parent element and specifying `margin-left:auto` will align to the right of the parent element. When both `margin-left: auto` and `margin-right: auto` are specified, the block element is centered on the parent element.
- margin-top, margin-bottom: If you specify a positive value, the distance between the block elements will be distant, and if you specify a negative value, it may become closer and overlap. The browser combines the bottom margin of the block above with the top margin of the block below.
- Border, padding: The outer width and height of the box are increased, and the block elements and the blocks behind them are pushed down. Specifying left and right borders and padding on auto-zoom block elements reduces the width of the inner box, and specifying left and right borders and padding on the specified size block elements pushes down due to lack of space for the inner box due to the border and padding.
- <h1>~<h6>, <p>, <blockquote>, <dt>, <address>, and <caption> are closing block elements that may contain content or inline elements, but cannot contain block elements.

### Table box

A table is a block box containing rows of cells. The table follows the block flow, and the cells in it follow the table flow of rows and columns. There is only margin on the table, no padding, only padding on the cell, and no margin. The two properties that affect the table box model are border-colapse and talbe-layout.

- Width, height: The width and height of the table are not the width and height inside the padding, but the width and height outside the border.
- margin: The results depend on which style is specified in the table, whether the specified size, auto-reduction, or auto-zoom. If a specified size table or auto-reduction table specifies a margin as a positive value, the table and the next table will be pushed back, and if a negative value is specified, the table may overlap adjacent elements. When an auto-zooming table is specified, the table is inserted, reducing the internal size and reducing the cell width.
- Border-overflow: This property does not apply to the table because the table cannot overflow the parent element. However, the cells in the table may overflow. To ensure that all browsers display the same for situations that are full of fixed cells, `overflow: hidden` must be specified in all cells.
- Border-collapse: Sets whether adjacent borders are displayed together.
- Table-layout: Set whether the table size is fixed or changed automatically according to the contents.
- IE9 versions below do not render borders around empty cells. To prevent this, `
- If the table and cell borders are displayed as one, specify the "border-colapse:colapse" property on the "table" element to combine the border of the table with the cell border. When combining the table border and the cell border in it, the cell spacing property value must be zero for the table element, regardless of whether the cell spacing property is specified, so that there is no problem with IE7 or lower versions.

### Absolute position box

Absolute elements are placed out of their original position, creating layers up and down, relative to or fixed on the screen of the closest parent element. It can be specified in a set size, automatically reduced to match the content, or automatically expanded to match the nearest parent element. All elements can be positioned absolutely and do not affect the placement of other boxes.

- z-index: Sets the order in which placed elements are stacked.
- left, right, top, bottom: Specifies the position of the absolute element.
- Width : The default value is `width: auto`. If width is auto and left and right are both auto, the absolute position box is automatically reduced to match the content. If the width is auto and the left and right are both zero or different values, the absolute position box is automatically enlarged to match the parent element. If you specify a value for width, left, and auto for right, the absolute position box is set to the specified size and the interval is set to the left. If you specify a value for width, right, and auto for left, the absolute position box is set to the specified size and the interval is set to the right.
- Height: Heigit, top, and bottom properties have the same principle as width, left, and right properties.
- margin : specifying a positive value moves the side of the absolute position box close to the center of the parent element, and specifying a negative value moves away from the center of the parent element.
- Border, padding: Specifying a border and padding reduces the size of the inner box of the auto zoom absolute position box. Specifying borders and padding on the designated size absolute position box and the automatic shrink absolute position box increases the size of the outer box, which moves the absolute position box toward the center of the parent element.

### Float box

The element that specifies the float property goes beyond its original position and covers the border and background of adjacent block elements. Thus, the size of the parent element that does not include the float element is reduced, and if the float was specified for all child elements of the parent element, there would be no content inside, so it would disappear altogether.

The float element deviates from its original position but pushes the adjacent content back as it enters the root flow. The float element is placed in the same longitudinal position as it was in its original position, and horizontally in the padding area on the left or right side of the parent element. Float elements are stacked next to other float elements at the same longitudinal point, and are lowered if there is no space to be placed next to another float elements.

- width : The default value is auto, which reduces the float element to the widest row.
- Height : The default value is auto, and the float element is reduced to match the height of all child block elements or rows.
- margin: applies differently to float elements only. Specifying a positive value pushes the float element away from the alignment point and moves the other float element and inline content away from the float element. When a negative value is specified, the float element is pulled to the opposite side of the alignment point and the other float element and inline content are closer to the float element. The margin around the float element is not combined.
- Border, padding : specifying the border and padding properties increases the external size of the float element.

### Change Box Model

This method changes the rendering method of elements in browsers.

```css
'p {display: inline; } /* Rendering inline */
strong { display: inline-block; } /* Rendering as an inline block */
em {display: block} /* Rendering as block */
dfn {display: list-item; } /* rendering in list format */
img {display: none} /* element not rendered at all */

```

When presenting an element as a list item, the parent element must be rendered as a block and the left padding or left margin must be placed in the bullit marker. This is because the list is structurally divided into external blocks such as ol, ul, and dl, and internal blocks such as li and dd.
