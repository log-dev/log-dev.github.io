Inheritance

In the real world, inheritance is the act of handing over the property that parents have to their children.

@ Inherit from object-oriented programming

> The act of passing on fields (properties) and methods from a parent (parent) object to a child (child) object

Child objects can have additional fields (attributes) and methods by extending the parent object

Inherit from: fields (properties) and methods

> We reuse the parent object so that it can be developed quickly.

Reduces repetitive code duplication

It provides convenience of maintenance.

The polymorphism of objects can be implemented.

Polymorphism

@ refers to properties that allow users to substitute objects of the same type but with different execution results.

> All child objects are accepted for the parent type.

All implementation objects are accepted for interface type.

> Objects can be partnered.

Easy to maintain.
