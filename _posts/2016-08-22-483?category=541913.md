Text-shadow for stereoscopic effects of text

The ability to express shadow effects on text using the `text-shadow` property has long been used and was first implemented in a Safari browser in 2005.

However, this property was excluded from CSS2.1 because all browser companies did not implement it.

This property has since been re-registered in the CSS3 specification and has recently been implemented almost in modern browsers.

### text-shadow

The shadow location of the text is specified using the x and y coordinates.

The simplest grammatical form uses only two values, x represents a horizontal distance (x offset) from the text and y represents a vertical distance (y offset).

And by default, the color of the shadow is inherited from the parent element (usually black), so you must specify a separate color value to specify a different color.

```css
.seletor-01 {
text-shadow: x y;
}
.seletor-02 {
text-shadow: x y color;
}
```

The following example shows a gray shadow in a position that has moved 3px to the right and 3px down.

```undefined
<h1>Shadows</h1>

<style>
h1 {
text-shadow: 3px 3px #bbb;
}
</style>
```

You do not need to use only positive numbers for offset values; you can use zero for coordinate values as well as negative numbers.

Let`s take a look at the following examples:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="336" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/jAJGyL?height=336&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=jAJGyL&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_jAJGyL"></iframe>

Understanding coordinate axes and coordinate systems

The grammar concept introduced in CSS3 is about coordinate axis.

It`s similar to what I heard at first glance in math class, but I need a slightly different approach.

The CSS uses a Cartesian coordinate system that intersects at right angles to each other; the horizontal line is the x-axis, the vertical line is the y-axis, and the part where the two lines intersect is called the origin.

So far, that coordinate axis is what we normally think, but CSS uses positive (+) and negative (-) signs along each coordinate axis as follows:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/251FFB3E57B3F49930)

The value of this coordinate system indicates the distance from the origin, and the positive and negative numbers indicate directionality.

That is, the coordinates of each point indicate the direction and distance from the origin.

The coordinates of the image above (5 and 3) represent the points along the x-axis and 3 pixels in the y-axis positive direction.

For another example, coordinates (-3, -5) represent 3 pixels in the negative direction along the x-axis and 5 pixels in the negative direction along the y-axis.

Even if the contents of the coordinate system feel strange, it is not difficult to understand because it has been used through various attributes such as `background-position`.

The `text-shadow` property has a fourth option, blur-radius.

This option adds a blur effect to the shadow effect, which must be specified after the offset value.

Let`s take a look at an example of adding a blur effect (the blurring feature).

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="421" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/RRdLqR?height=421&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=RRdLqR&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_RRdLqR"></iframe>

The first black letter used the same offset value and added a `blur-radius` value to blur 5px to create a smoother shadow effect, while the second white letter defined an offset value of 0 and a blur effect of 8px, indicating that the text itself is the same as the background color, but the blur effect.

### Expressing Multiple Shading Effects

So far, only one shadow has been represented in the letter, but the `text-shadow` statement supports grammar that allows multiple shadows to be added to the text.

To represent multiple shadows, you can use commas as separators to add only attribute values.

Consider the following examples of representing multiple shadows.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/mEoqJm?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=mEoqJm&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_mEoqJm"></iframe>

The first example defines the x offset value as zero and the y offset value as negative from -2px to -8px.

And the blur-radius value is applied from 3px to 9px, and the shadow color is gradually darkened so that under the letter, the light color like a fluorescent lamp appears, and the darker the shadow appears as it moves away from the letter.

In the second example, only the y offset gradually increased in positive direction to the same value with the x offset value of zero. We set blur-radius to the same as the first example, and this time we used the `rgba()` color function to represent the overlapping shadow elements with transparency to create a natural shadow effect.

### letterpress effect

The letterpress effect is a style that gives the impression that it was taken by lightly pressing the letters on the background like stamping on a thick piece of paper or leather.

Let`s implement this style using CSS3 text-shadow.

To create this effect, you need four tones of color: dark color for letters, medium color for background, and lighter color and darker color for shadowing.

Then you can apply the `text-shadow` grammar with multiple shading values.
