Deburgging - console, alert

This article summarizes how JavaScript is debugged.

First, you will learn about the concept of debugging.

In the computer field, debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs or avoiding errors on a computer program or hardware device.

To eliminate program or hardware device defects, you must remove the problem and correct it. If a program has been debugged or fixed a program`s fault, it means that there is no more error.

In other words, it`s about fixing the program`s bugs.

A bug refers to a malfunction in a program, even if it`s a long program, it`s basically good to put a breakpoint on the suspected code part and run it little by little to see if a lot of different values come out right, but it might be more efficient to create a bug from the beginning.

If the wrong variable goes over to an argument, it`s either a return value or two or more algorithms, such as an important function, to compare the calculations with each other. This debugging should only be based on practice and experience.

### alert

It`s a simple way to write an alert statement in JavaScript.

This will display the alert dialog box when you open the web browser. JavaScript version of debugging using so-called print.

This method is available in any web browser. In addition, all JavaScript will stop running while the alert dialog is displayed.

This allows you to create large volumes of alerts, such as phased execution.

However, it is not very convenient to close the alert dialog (warning window) one by one.

Furthermore, if you accidentally run an alert in an infinite loop, you will not be able to close the window if you cannot terminate the process in the web browser.

The following example is a code that overrides the toString() method, changes the string, and then displays the string in the alert:

```js
var StringObject = function (text) {
this.text = text
};

var strObj = new StringObject('안녕, alert');

alert(strObj); // [object object] is output.

strObj.toString = function () {
return this.text;
};

alert(strObj); // Hi, alert is printed.
```

### Learn console

Today`s web browsers have a standard console feature for running JavaScript.

Originally, it was a function implemented in Fireburg, an add-on for Firefox, but as more developers use Fireburg, it is standard for safari and Google Chrome.

When you write a code in a JavaScript, such as `console.log(`using console object`);`, the console displays "Use console object."

It is essentially the same as using an alert, but using a console does not require closing each dialog box, so it would be better to use than an alert.

You can also display more detailed data than notifications.

However, please be aware that there will be an error in browsers (without console objects) that do not exist in standards such as Internet Explorer.

dummy console object

In fact, if you`re using console objects, you`ll need to remove the code from the console, but if you want to test it a little bit during development, it`ll be a hassle to remove the console code as part of it.

Therefore, it is also used to put dummy console objects so that no errors can occur even in browsers where console objects such as Internet Explorer do not exist.

The dummy console object, which provides all the methods contained in Fireburg`s console object, can be created as shown below:

If you write it at the top of the JavaScript code that reads it for the first time, there will be no error due to console calls.

In practice, when you release it, you must also remove the code, such as console.log.

Of course, you can leave the code below, but if you want to reduce the amount of code and improve performance, you`d better remove it.

```js
if(!window.console) {
(function(win){

var names = [
'assert', 'clear', 'count', 'debug', 'dir', 'dirxml', 'error',
'exception', 'group', 'groupCollapsed', 'groupEnd', 'info', 'log',
'markTimeline', 'profile', 'profileEnd', 'table', 'time', 'timeEnd',
'timeline', 'timelineEnd', 'timeStamp', 'trace', 'warn'
];

var consoleMock = {};

for (var i = 0, len = names.length; i < len; i++) {
consoleMock[names[i]] = function () {};
}

win.console = consoleMock;

})(window);
}
```

You can also write the above code as below.

```js
(function() {
var method;
var noop = function () {};
var methods = [
'assert', 'clear', 'count', 'debug', 'dir', 'dirxml', 'error',
'exception', 'group', 'groupCollapsed', 'groupEnd', 'info', 'log',
'markTimeline', 'profile', 'profileEnd', 'table', 'time', 'timeEnd',
'timeline', 'timelineEnd', 'timeStamp', 'trace', 'warn'
];
var length = methods.length;
var console = (window.console = window.console || {});

while (length--) {
method = methods[length];
console.log(method);
// Only stub undefined methods.
if (!console[method]) {
console[method] = noop;
}
}
}());
```

Console method for displaying messages or objects

The following methods provide almost the same functionality, taking a message or object as a factor and outputting its contents to the console.

You can specify any number of factors, and it outputs all of them.

```js
console.log();

console.debug();

console.error();

console.warn();

console.info();
```

By default, only the `log()` method is sufficient.

The `debug()` method is convenient for large quantities of the `console.log()` family of methods, but it is now recommended to use the log instead in a de-preserved state (which will no longer be used and will disappear in the future).

The row numbers are also displayed in `error(), `warm(), and `info()`, and the difference from debug() is that the icons or characters displayed in the console window are different in color, but there are not many things to use with awareness.

console.dir()

The console.dir() method dumps objects passed by the factor to make them easier to see.

It is easier to see than when outputting, such as console.log(), but you should be careful that other logs are flowing because they are longer at once.

console.trace()

Using the method `console.trace()` shows where the function is called from.

You can also see which event of the object is triggered.

When creating event processing, it may be difficult to pinpoint which function is called at which time.

This is convenient because the `console.trace()` method lets you know the path to the place you called.

console.time(), console.timeEnd()

The method `console.time(), console.timeEnd()` measures time, number of times, and performance.

When you specify a name that you want to define for each factor, the same name is paired, and the elapsed time is output in between.

The displayed time is in milliseconds.

The following example checks the repeat statement performance with console-time methods.

```js
'console.time('check repeat performance'));
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
console.log(i);
}
console.timeEnd ('check repeat performance');
```

console.count()

The `console.count()` method allows you to see how many times a particular row has been run.

Please check the following example.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
console.count('foo');
if (i % 10 === 0) {
console.count('bar');
}
}

```
