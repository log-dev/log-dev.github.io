Function that overrides itself

Functions can be dynamically defined and assigned to variables.

When you create a new function and assign it to a variable that already has another function, the new function overwrites the previous function.

In a way, the old function pointer is reused to point to a new function.

You can also do this within the body of the previous function.

In this case, the function can overwrite and override itself with a new implementation.

Perhaps it sounds more complicated than it really is, but let`s take a look at the simple example below.

### Lazy function definition

Let`s take a look at the following examples:

```js
var scareMe = function () {
console.log('Boo!!!');
scareMe = function () {
console.log('Boooo~~~~~~~~~');
};
};

// use functions that define themselves
scareMe(); // Boo!!! Record of
"ScareMe(); // Boooo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
```

This pattern is useful if the function performs any initialization preparation only once.

Some of the functions will no longer be useful because there is no reason to repeat unnecessary tasks, and in this case, the function can override itself to update its implementation.

Simply put, this pattern certainly helps the performance of the application when the overridden function has less workload.

The disadvantage of this pattern is that once you redefine yourself, you will not be able to find all the properties that you previously added to the original function.

In addition, if a function is used under a different name, for example, if it is assigned to another variable or used as a method of an object, the body of the source function is executed, not the overridden part.

Take a look at an example of using the `scareMe()` function as a top-level object:

```js
var scareMe = function () {
console.log('Boo!!!');
scareMe = function () {
console.log('Boooo~~~~~~~~~');
};
};

// 1. Add a new property.
scareMe.property = 'properly';

// use functions that override themselves.
console.log(scareMe.property);
scareMe();
scareMe();


// 2. Assign As
var prank = scareMe;

// 3. Define for use as a method.
var spooky = {
boo: scareMe
};

// Call to a name assigned by another name.
prank(); // Boo!!! Record of
prank(); // Boo!!! Record of
console.log(prank.property); // properly 가 기록

spooky.boo(); // Boo!!! Record of
spooky.boo(); // Boo!!! Record of
console.log(spooky.boo.property); // properly 가 기록

// try to use functions that override themselves after assigning them as different names and methods above.
Take care Me(); // Boooo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Take care Me(); // Boooo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
console.log(scareMe.property); // undefined 가 기록
```

As you can see in the example, when a function is assigned to a new variable, it does not define itself unexpectedly.

Whenever `prank()` is called, `Boo!!` is output to the console.

In addition, after overwriting the global `scareMe()` function, the `prank()` self still refers to the previous definition, including the property property.

The same thing happens when a function is used as the `boo()` method of a spooky object.

All of these calls continue to overwrite the global `scareMe()` pointer.

Therefore, when the global `scareMe()` is called at the end, the updated body to print out "Boooo~~~~~~~~~~" is executed properly as the first one.

You will also no longer be able to refer to the careMe.property.
