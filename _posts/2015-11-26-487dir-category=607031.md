A description of the technique used when you want an image element or video element to be expanded or reduced to a specific proportion. It helps you understand the principles by implementing it only using CSS without using the script.

### Maintaining image proportions

A way to resize an image while maintaining its proportion is to resize it with either the width or height of the image maintaining the auto value. Methods commonly used in reactive images are as follows.

```css
img {
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
}

```

To freely adjust the width of the reactive image, add a container to cover it and give it the appropriate width as shown below.

```html
<div class="thumbnail-wrapper">
<img src="xxxx">
</div>
```

```css
.thumbnail-wrappper {
width: 25%;
}

img {
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
}

```

The image was given only widths to maintain the proportion of the image`s original, so the image had its own unifying height. It also gives a % width value to have a flexible width, but the height cannot.

Typically, if you give a fixed height value and cut the excess, you will get the following results.

```css
.thumbnail-wrappper {
width: 25%;
height: 200px;
overflow: hidden;
}

img {
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
}

```

It is an unrecommended method because it results in a failure to correspond to a fluid width. The container also realizes that a certain percentage is needed.

### Keep container proportions

The key technique used to maintain the ratio of containers is to understand the following contributions to the 2009 Creating Intrinsic Ratios for Video:

> The percentage stage (%, percentage) refers to the width of the container block.

As we know, the percentage unit is calculated based on the parent component. Surprisingly, the vertical padding value of the child element is also affected by the width of the parent element. If you ask me why... It was created as such and is common to browsers. This feature allows the creation of containers that maintain a certain proportion using padding values in either direction, up or down.

```html
<div class="thumbnail-wrapper">
<div class="thumbnail">
<img src="xxxx">
</div>
</div>
```

```css
.thumbnail-wrappper {
width: 25%;
}

.thumbnail {
position: relative;
padding-top: 100%; /* 1:1 ratio */
overflow: hidden;
}

img {
position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;
right: 0;
bottom: 0;
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
}

```

This excludes images with each height from the flow of documents through absolute positioning, making the height of the image impossible to affect the height of the container and the newly added `.The top padding value of the thumbnail` element causes the height to be adjusted.

In other words, the image is exposed only as much as the top padding value, and the remaining overflows are cut, so the container maintains a constant ratio and responds to fluid width changes.

Various ratios can be obtained by changing the value of padding-top as shown below.

- 2:1 : `padding-top: 50%`
- 1:2 : `padding-top: 200%`
- 4:3 : `padding-top: 75%`
- 16:9 : `padding-top: 56.25%`

### Center and fill images

If the size of the image to be printed is somewhat predictable, the width and proportion of the container can be modified to make the image fill the container. In the above ratio example, the 4:3 ratio would be the recommended form of the image to be output.

If the size of the image is not predictable, we can at least try to make it centered. The code used above requires re-adjustment.

```html
<div class="thumbnail-wrapper">
<div class="thumbnail">
<div class="centered">
<img src="xxxx">
</div>
</div>
</div>
```

```css
.thumbnail-wrappper {
width: 25%;
}

.thumbnail {
position: relative;
padding-top: 100%; /* 1:1 ratio */
overflow: hidden;
}

.thumbnail .centered {
position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;
right: 0;
bottom: 0;
-webkit-transform: translate(50%,50%);
-ms-transform: translate(50%,50%);
transform: translate(50%,50%);
}

.thumbnail .centered img {
position: absolute;
top: 0;
left: 0;
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
-webkit-transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
-ms-transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
transform: translate(-50%,-50%);
}

```

Of course, IE8 and below, which do not support the `translate` property, do not align. CSS alone is a limitation.

The images used in the above examples use the default values for reactive images. Because width has been limited to `max-width` properties, it is not able to fill up the screen even if width reaches maximum.

If the width of the container is larger than the original image and the reactive image setting is removed, the space that cannot fill the screen is clearly revealed.

Long, long-form images are often called portraits, which require the width of the image to be adjusted to the width of the specified area.

```css
img.portrait {
width: 100%;
height: auto;
}

```

Similarly, horizontally long images are often referred to as landscape. These types of images must be set to the height of the image in a given area to fill the screen.

```css
img.landscape {
width: auto;
height: 100%;
}

```

The above images are damaged because the width and height of each image were forcibly increased to 100% to fill the container area beyond the size of the original image. If `max-width` and `max-height` are used, the maximum size of images cannot exceed the original size and leaves a margin, and each of them should be used according to the situation.

Unfortunately, adding the desired class name by image type is not possible only with CSS, and it is necessary to use a script to compare the actual width and actual height of the image to give the contextual class name. Of course, if the server team already supports it, it`s a different story, but...

### Crop Image

If you leave the width and height of the images set above as auto values, the size of the original image will be output in the container. If the middle is aligned, the middle part will be cut and visible.

In other words, depending on the size of the container, depending on where you want to align, you can cut and expose pictures of the original image. Since the translate property was used for alignment, you may need to adjust this value as much as you want, and you may be able to remove all the translate properties and select the area to cut using the absolute positioning directly.

> So far, the conclusion is that a complete model cannot be implemented without the use of scripts. At least if the server team supports the form classification of images that will be used as thumbnail, it will be able to reach the desired result.
