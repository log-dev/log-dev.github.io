Windows 10 is equipped with a new DirectX (DX) 12. It is the first change in more than six years since the 11th version, and considering the development of GPUs (graphic cards), it is a part that cannot hide expectations. Most of all, those who like games will be pleased with the performance improvement and lower power consumption with the advent of the new DX.

DirectX is a library (API, platform) used to bring games and multimedia to maximum performance without loss. Developers will create products using the DX library, which is well-received in terms of performance.

### DirectX 12 appears

In the past, DX11 was released with Windows 7, with minor updates continuing. Since then, DX12 has emerged as a new version in six years. Although the development of GPUs (graphic cards) has been rapid, the API of DX, which will be in charge of handling them, has been stagnant.

In order for hardware to reliably support its maximum performance, most of all, software support is needed, and with the launch of Windows 10, software that will narrow the gap has emerged. Unlike DX, which previously released a new version on a yearly basis, test reports follow that performance improvement will develop rapidly if it is used because it is a new version in a long time.

> Creating games and other multimedia software takes more than one to two years to develop, so accurate performance test reporting will begin with the emergence of software that formally supports it.

### DirectX 12 Performance Improvement

Since DX11 was introduced in 2009, multi-core penetration was low, and there was a lack of technology and difficulty in controlling multiple cores needed to utilize them properly. As a result, DX12 focused on improving the CPU load by increasing the utilization of multiple cores, and succeeded in significantly improving it.

While existing DX supports multi-core CPU environments, if the load is concentrated on one core, DX12 can distribute the remaining threads, reducing overall CPU runtime by less than half. DX12 provides direct access to hardware, reducing unnecessary API overhead, significantly improving the efficiency and performance of tasks handled using multi-core CPUs.

### Using DirectX 12 Multi-GPU

Previously, there was a way to install multiple GPUs and improve performance with technologies called crossfire and SLI. However, the limitation of existing technologies was that GPUs should be prepared with the same products from the same manufacturer. The DX12 supports multi-GPU, which allows for graphics processing in combination, regardless of CPU-embedded graphics and manufacturer or performance. Although it has not yet achieved satisfactory test results, there is no doubt that it will be an improved technology in the future.

### DirectX 12 enabled GPU

Most GPUs produced in recent years will support this, GPU manufacturers say, but let`s not think that all of DX12`s capabilities will be available. Some performance improvements will be made, and so will the newer, higher-performance GPUs.

Intel`s graphics-embedded CPUs are supported by the Intel Haswell fourth-generation core and Broadwell fifth-generation core processors.

DX11 supports DX12 for all products equipped with GPU that can be used by DX11. The GeForce 600, 700, 900 series and GTX Titan series, a family of Kepler and Maxwell architectures, will also be supported by other Fermi architectures. Let`s check the Fermi architecture product line directly at WH NVIDIA GPUs will support DX12?

Radeon HD 70000, 80000 series, Radeon R7, R9 series, AMD A4/A6/A8/A10-7000 APU (codenamed Carberry), AMD A6/A8/A10 PRO-7000 APU (codenamed Carberry), AMD E1/A4/A10 Micro-6000 APU (codenamed Mulein/AMD), AMD/A6/A2 EPU/AMD/A4).

### DirectX verification method

- Start Menu > Run or Start Menu Right-click > Run
- Enter dxdiag and confirm
- Checking the version on the DirectX Diagnostic Tool System tab
