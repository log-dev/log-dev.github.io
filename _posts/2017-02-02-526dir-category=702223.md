The PHP variable responsible for the title output on the gnubod is `$g5[`title`]`. Let`s look at the settings and the principles of the title of each page and revise them.

### Responsible for Site Title ($g5_head_title)

The place where the title of the site is set on the nooboard is head.This is a sub.php file.

In the head area of the head.sub.php file, `<title><?php echo $g5_head_title; ?></title>>><g5_head_title> is a PHP variable head.The variable value is set at the top of the sub.php file as shown below.

```php
if (!isset($g5['title'])) {
$g5['title'] = $config['cf_title'];
$g5_head_title = $g5['title'];
}
else {
$g5_head_title = $g5['title']; // Title displayed in the status bar
$g5_head_title .= " | ".$config['cf_title'];
}





```

- £ If the variable $g5 [`title`] is not set, set the variables in the following syntax. (The value of the $g5[`title`] variable that you print depends on the page you are accessing because the snoopboard creates a separate title for the bulletin board and a specific page.)
- £ If the value of the variable $g5[`title`] is not set, take the value of the homepage title set in the administrator`s preference and assign it to `$g5[`title`]`.
- £ If the variable value of $g5 [`title`] is not set, take the value of the homepage title as shown above and assign it to `$g5_head_title`.
- When the variable value of £ $g5[`title`] is set, i.e. for certain pages that have their own bulletin boards or titles, take the page titles and homepage titles already set in $g5[`title`] and assign them to `$g5_head_title`. Detailed page name or bulletin board title | Site title.

### Output under brand name

When a site is collected by search engines or other bots, the heading tags of the site are highlighted, and the "<h1" tag of the site. Considering the contents of the book, it is easy to understand, but the main title (h1) and the contents below (h2,h3,h4) are divided into detailed contents.

At the top of the head.php file, print the title as shown below. In the case of Gnubod, the basic type uses a logo image, and the part is actually collected by bots, although the part is invisible to the eyes.

```php
"<!-- Top Start { -->
<div id="hd">
<h1 id="hd_h1"><?php echo $g5['title'] ?></h1>


```

- £ Print the brand name (not on the screen).

### Output to Body

At the bottom of the head.php file, print the title as shown below.

```php
'<!-- Content launch { -->
<div id="wrapper">
<div id="aside">
<?phpecho outlogin('basic'); // external login, specifying skin as theme/basic to use the theme's skin?>
<?phpecho poll('basic'); // survey, to use the theme's skin, specify the skin like theme/basic?>
</div>
<div id="container">
<?php if ((!$bo_table || $w == 's' )
```

- £ If it is not a bulletin board, a secret article, or an index page, it shall be printed under the title of the text.

Title of the page

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/2564F84B58879B2015)

### Output to bulletin board

If the text is a bulletin in the output section of the text viewed above, it is subject to a different application, which sets the value of variable `$g5[`title`] in the board.php file as shown below.

```php
.....
$g5['title'] = strip_tags(conv_subject($write['wr_subject'], 255))." > ".((G5_IS_MOBILE
```

- £ Bring the title of bulletin board set up on mobile and PC and assign it to `$g5[`title`]`.
- £ If there is more than one page on the bulletin board, assign the number of pages to `$g5[`title`]`.
