Here`s an open-source web analyzer you found while looking for a replacement for awstats. Easy to install, clean UI, and mobile support for real-time analysis. This is a php-based application that is similar to Google Analytics provided by Google and provides extensions.

You can install it by referring to the above installation method, which is briefly described in Ubuntu.

### Preinstallation Requirements

- php 5.1.3 or later (recommended for php 5.3 or later)
- MySQL 4.1 or later
- pdo and pdo_mysql PHP extension (enabled by default)
- PHP GD Extensions
- MySQL User Requirements

If you are using Webhosting, you must add piwik users to the DB used by hosting and grant privileges to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, LOCK.

Mysql connection (hosting users access their IDs with their mysql connection)

```bash
mysql -uroot -p

```

Create Database (Hosting Users Use Granted DB)

```undefined
CREATE DATABASE piwik;

```

The `$piwik_db_name_here` part of the syntax below enters the DB name created - piwik (hosting user enters the DB name granted)

User name to be created is piwik, set to password in `$password` part

It is recommended to read LOAD DATA INFILE (Error handling method) before entering the command below.

```undefined
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON $piwik_db_name_here.* TO piwik@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '$password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

```

### Install Piwik

Download, extract, and move the latest version to the directory to serve.

```bash
wget http://builds.piwik.org/latest.zip
unzip latest.zip
sudo mv piwik /var/www/example.com/public_html
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/example.com/public_html/

```

(Users who use hosting download and decompress http://builds.piwik.org/latest.zip to upload the piwik directory in binary mode.)

It is accessed via a web browser by http://domain name/piwik.

If a problem occurs at this time, piwik suggests a solution.

1. Welcome. Select Next

2. Verify that the server meets Piwik requirements. If a problem occurs, it tells you how to correct it.

3. Database installation

- database server : localhost
- login : piwik
- Password : Password specified above
- database name : DB name specified above
- table prefix : piwik_
- adapter : PDO_MYSQL

4. Verify Database Installation

5. Create Table

6. Create Super User

Piwik can add new websites and users to monitor, change user permissions, and perform administrative tasks that enable or disable plug-ins.

7. Website Settings

- Website name : my blog (site name to analyze)
- Website URL: http://blog.uzuro.com (site address to analyze)
- Website time zone: Seoul
- E-commerce: Normal sites are not e-commerce sites

8. JavaScript Tags
Copy the trace tag and paste it before the </body> tag on all pages where analysis trace will be used. When creating a web page, it is recommended to paste it in a place that is used repeatedly, such as header.php or footer.php. If WordPress is used, it provides a plug-in. WP-Piwik Plug-in

9. Congratulations.

### Setting up GeoIP

Piwik uses MaxMind`s GeoIP databases to pinpoint location information more accurately than in the past. The location information database provided by MaxMind has a commercial version and a free version, which is less accurate. The free version includes a database that provides the country`s IP address and a GeoLiteCity database that provides the city`s IP, which GeoLiteCity recommends because it is the same as the commercial version.

To enable GeoIP, go to Settings > Geographic Location. Piwik includes tools to download geolitecity databases (in my case, this automatic download did not work).

The latest version of piwik includes automatic updates to the GeoIP database. When downloading GeoLite City manually, the compressed file must be decompressed and renamed from GeoLiteCity.dat to GeoIPCity.dat.

Copy it to the site where GeoIP will be used (e.g. /var/www/example.com/public_html/piwik/misc/).

```bash
cd /var/www/example.com/piwik/misc
sudo wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
sudo gunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
sudo mv GeoLiteCity.dat GeoIPCity.dat

```

When using the free version, location information may be marked as Unknown. It can be shown by widgeting in real time in conjunction with visitor-world-map using GeoIP.

The default value of the location provider is set to the value provided by the ISP, and GeoIP is recommended.

This location provider does not require installation and configuration on the server, so it is a suitable installation method for shared hosting. We use the GeoIP database and MaxMind`s PHP API to accurately determine the location of visitors.

If the website has high traffic, this location provider recommends using PECL or installing an Apache server module because it is too slow.

This location provider uses the PECL module and the GeoIP database to accurately and efficiently determine the location of visitors. There are no restrictions on use, so I recommend this.

Install essentials for installing and configuring packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential

```

Install what you need to install PEAR with apt-get

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-pear

```

Install the Package Required for Compiling PHP5 Source Files

```bash
sudo apt-get install php5-dev

```

Installing the PHP5 Interworking Module and Library

```bash
sudo apt-get install php5-geoip php5-dev libgeoip-dev

```

Install GeoIP using pecl

```bash
sudo pecl install geoip

```

In the PHP setup file, set geoip.so in the [PHP] section and set the geoip directory in the [gd] section.

```undefined
sudo vi /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

[PHP]
extension=geoip.so

[gd]
geoip.custom_directory=/var/www/example.com/public_html/piwik/misc

```

Restart Apache

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart

```

Access the Piwik page and navigate to Settings > Geographic Location to select GeoIP (PECL).

This location provider can use Apache`s GeoIP module to quickly and accurately, but only trace from a regular browser.

Module Installation

```bash
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-geoip

```

Module Settings

```undefined
sudo vi /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/geoip.conf

; GeoIP database path
GeoIPDBFile /var/www/example.com/public_html/piwik/misc/GeoIPCity.dat
GeoIPScanProxyHeaders On

```

Restart Apache and GeoIP Extensions

```bash
sudo service apache2 restart

```

### Troubleshooting

Using Piwik, it solves some problems.

I explained in detail above.

Piwik`s plug-in is distributed as a zip file, which can be decompressed and uploaded as a plug-in folder under the Piwik/plugins directory to manage it through the Settings > Plug-in - Installed menu.

In the current version, active/inactive does not work if there is a problem with the Korean translation part, so it works if you switch to English through a language change in the entire menu (top).

The geoip-related installation creates and automatically includes the /etc/php5/conf.d/geoip.ini file, which seems to be caused by adding it one more time in the above settings. Delete `extension=geoip.so` added to the /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini file.
