# git error after macOS update

Whenever I update macOS, errors always occur in various programs.
After updating to `High Sierra` this time, I was quite embarrassed because `git` order didn`t work.
Enter `git --version` and you will see the following:

```bash
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun

```

This will resolve the issue when reinstalling `XCode` or only reinstalling `XCode`s Command line tools` as shown below.

```bash
$ xcode-select --install

```

> Remember, in MAC git is attached to XCode's ComÂ­mand line tools.
