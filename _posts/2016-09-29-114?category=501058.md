Function as Value

In JavaScript, a function is also an object.

In other words, it`s a kind of value.

Almost every language has a function, but the difference between a JavaScript function and a function in another language is that it can be used as a value.

So what are the characteristics of the value?

For example, a value can contain a string `value` in any variable.

var a = `value`;

The value can contain a string `value` in any variable.

The reason why you can hold the string value is because value is the value.

The function in JavaScript also has properties that can be contained in variables, which is different from the function in other languages.

function a() {}

The function defined above is a kind of value contained in a JavaScript variable called a.

This is also referred to as a function variable.

If you define the above functions in a different way:

var a = function() {}

This way, you can understand that the function is clearly used as a value.

That is, the definition of a function is contained in a variable and the function is written as a value.

The function can also be included as a value for an object, which is called a method, which contains the value of the object`s properties.

The function cal executes an incase passed to the first factor, where the value of the second factor passes 1 to the factor.

The function create returns the calculated result and cal returns the value again.

### The function can be returned as the return value of the function.

The function can also be used as the return value of the function.

### Functions can dynamically create and assign properties

To continue to emphasize, in JavaScript, a function is also an object.

In addition to code execution, which is the fundamental function of a function, the function itself can generate and assign a property like a normal object.

You can see that the add() function dynamically creates the result property as if it were a normal object and saves the result of calling the add() function.

You can access it using add.result, add.status, just like a typical object`s approach.

In other words, in JavaScript, a function not only performs code of a particular function, but is also a special object that can have its own property like a regular object.

### Assign to elements in a variable or array, property of an object, etc.

The function can also be used as a value in an array.

As described above, functions are treated as values. And the function is an object.

This means that functions can be treated like normal objects.

Therefore, the JavaScript function can behave as follows:

> 1. The function is generated by literal.
2. Functions can be transferred to the factors of functions.
3. Assignments can be made to elements of variables or arrays, object properties, etc.
4. The function can be returned to the return value of the function.
5. Functions can dynamically generate and assign profiles.

These types of data are called first-class objects, first-class citizen, and entity in programming.

### Callback

Callback is also closely related to the use of functions as values.

Properties that can be used as values allow you to pass functions to factors in a function.

Because functions passed by values can be called, they can be used to completely change the behavior of the functions.

The following code completely changes the behavior of the built-in sort method according to the implementation of the function sortNumber passed by the factor:

The callback function is primarily used to export the processing results inside the function to the outside of the function. You can think of it as a kind of return door.
