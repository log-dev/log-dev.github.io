## CSS Gradients

A gradient is an intermediate step from one color to another, called a gradient, with a type of linear and circular gradient.

Try to learn about linear, circular gradients.

### Linear Gradient

A linear gradient can be defined as one axis, called a gradient line, in which each point has a different color value.

The gradient line is defined by the area center coordinates and angles in the form of a box containing the gradient.

The color value of the gradient is defined as the starting point, the ending point, and the color stop point between these two points.

The starting point is the point at which the gradient color starts on the gradient line, and the ending point is similar to the starting point, and the gradient color is the end point.

In addition to starting points and ending points, you can define what is called a color stop point on the gradient line.

Manufacturers can use color stop points between the start and end points to create more different color transition effects, and can also configure multi-color gradients.

Default Syntax

```css
기본구문: linear-gradient( [ <angle> | to <side-or-corner> ,]? <color-stop> [, <color-stop>]+ )
\---------------------------------/ \----------------------------/
Define gradient lines Define color stop points

where <side-or-corner> = [left | right] || [top | bottom]
and <color-stop> = <color> [ <percentage> | <length> ]?
```

```css
'/* 45 degree slope, starting with blue and ending with red */
background: linear-gradient( 45deg, blue, red );

/* Gradient starting with bottom, right, ending with top, left, blue, ending with red */
background: linear-gradient( to left top, blue, red);

/*
Start at bottom and end at top (vertical gradient),
Start at blue and switch to green at 40%,
Gradient ending with red
*/
background: linear-gradient( 0deg, blue, green 40%, red ); 
```

Angle of gradient

The angle of the linear gradient is used to determine which direction the gradient is facing.

```css
background: linear-gradient( 90deg, #ff3400, #f7e763 );
```

The gradient orientation according to the angle is as follows:

- 0deg (360deg): Gradient direction from starting color to ending color
- 90deg : Gradient direction from starting color to ending color
- 180deg: Gradient direction from starting color to ending color
- 270deg : Gradient direction from starting color to ending color

Setting gradient direction: left, top, right, bottom

```css
'/* Destination is lower */
background: linear-gradient( to bottom, #ff3400, #f7e763 );

/* Destination Top */
background: linear-gradient( to top, #ff3400, #f7e763 );

/* Destination is at the top right corner */
background: linear-gradient( to top right, #ff3400, #f7e763 );

/* Destination is at the bottom left corner */
background: linear-gradient( to bottom left, #ff3400, #f7e763 );
```

Specify color and color position values for the gradient intermediate step

```css
'/* Set intermediate level color */
background: linear-gradient( to bottom, #ff3400, #45d5bf, #f7e763 );

/* Specify color position value (last value means 100% from all position value) */
background-image: linear-gradient( 45deg, #ff3400 30%, #45d5bf 60%, #f7e763 );

background: linear-gradient(
45deg,
#6c52da 25%,
#ff3400 25%,
#ff3400 50%,
#45d5bf 50%,
#45d5bf 75%,
#f7e763 75%,
#f7e763
);
```

### Radial-gradient

The circular gradient is also the same as the linear gradient and grammar.

```css
'/* default ellipses */
background: radial-gradient( #6c52da, #2e2f32 );

/* circle */
background: radial-gradient(circle, #6c52da 50%, #2e2f32 50%);

/* Default fast-corner */
background: radial-gradient(circle,
#f7e763
#6c52da,
#2e2f32
);

/* close-corner (to the nearest part of the garden in gradient color */
background: radial-gradient(circle closest-side,
#f7e763
#6c52da,
#2e2f32
);
```

### Utilize overlay gradient

Overlay gradient refers to the use of images such as gradient colors and background patterns together.

```css
''/* Invalid multi-background technique */
background:
linear-gradient(45deg, #ff3400, #f7e763),
url("//goo.gl/B6SfbX");
background-size: contain, 120px;
```

The above code draws gradients in code order and the background image pattern falls below them.

However, the above code will only show gradient colors, and the pattern image will not be visible.

In order to make the background image visible, you must change the gradient color to an alpha-valued form as shown in the code below to see the pattern image.

```css
`/* Take advantage of the correct multi-background technique */
background:
linear-gradient(45deg, rgba(255, 52, 0, .4), rgba(247, 231, 99, .4)),
url("//goo.gl/B6SfbX");
background-size: contain, 120px;
```

### Multigredient

Multi-gredients are similar to the previous multi-background techniques.

In other words, multiple gradients can be overlapped to show, and if the opacity is not 100%, it will be expressed in a mixture of colors.

Explore the following code:

```css
'/* Multi-linear Gradient */
background:
linear-gradient(217deg, rgba(255, 0, 0, .78), rgba(255, 0, 0, 0) 65.70%),
linear-gradient(127deg, rgba(0, 255, 0, .78), rgba(0, 255, 0, 0) 65.70%),
linear-gradient(336deg, rgba(0, 0, 255, .78), rgba(0, 0, 255, 0) 65.70%);
```

```css
'/* Multi Round Gradient */
background:
/* x-axis 50% y-axis 0 => extends above */
radial-gradient(circle at 50% 0, rgba(255, 0, 0, .45), rgba(255, 0, 0, 0) 65.70%),
/* 6.7% x-axis y-axis 75% */
radial-gradient(circle at 6.7% 75%, rgba(0, 255, 0, .45), rgba(0, 255, 0, 0) 65.70%),
/* 6.7% x-axis y-axis 75% */
radial-gradient(circle at 93.3% 75%, rgba(0, 0, 255, .45), rgba(0, 0, 255, 0) 65.70%),
url("//goo.gl/B6SfbX");

/* first, second, third image is 100%, forth image is 140px */
background-size: 100%, 100%, 100%, 140px;
```

In the case of a circle, a circle is drawn from the center point, and you can use the at keyword to set where the circle is sprayed.

### Repeat Gradient

Repeat gradients can be used repeatedly, similar to using the background image repeat.

```css
'/* Repeat Linear Gradient */
background: repeating-linear-gradient( -45deg, red, red 10px, yellow 10px, yellow 20px );

/* Repeat Round Gradient */
background: repeating-radial-gradient( circle at 50% 50%, red, red 10px, yellow 10px, yellow 20px );
```

Repeated gradients can be useful when using patterns.

Box shadow

Just as the text has a `text-shadow` property, CSS3 provides a `box-shadow` property as a way to add shadows to box elements.

### box-shadow Syntax

```css
.box { box-shadow: outset | inset horizontal vertical blur spread color; }
```

The property values for `box-shadow` are as follows:

- set : Keyword to choose whether the shadow appears inside or outside the element
If you do not set an indet value separately with the default outset, the default setting value causes a shadow outside the element.
- Horizontal, vertical: A keyword for setting length that determines how often shadows appear horizontally or vertically from box elements.
These values must be set to make shadows appear.
- blur : Sets the degree of blur effect, which is also expressed in length
- spread : value for setting the distance the shadow spreads widely
- color : Specifies the color of the shadow, if not a separate color, represent black

Box Shadows Example

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="384" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/qNvpEX?height=384&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=qNvpEX&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=box-shadow%20%231&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="box-shadow #1" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_qNvpEX"></iframe>

The style rule above represents a dark gray shadow in the outer area of the element (no inset applied), moving 4px in both landscape and longitudinal directions, and applying a 3px blur effect.

To determine how the shadow of a box element differs depending on the value of the box-shadow property, look at the following code:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="443" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/BzbJdg?height=443&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=BzbJdg&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=box-shadow%20%232&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="box-shadow #2" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_BzbJdg"></iframe>

set keyword example

When the `inset` keyword is applied, it shows a shadow inside the box, which appears to be flipping on the other side of the box.

In other words, normal shadows without `inset` (set to outset) are applied with a positive x,y value and a shadow appears at the bottom right of the box, but when an insert is applied, the shadow appears at the top left of the box.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="448" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/wWONrG?height=448&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=wWONrG&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;pen-title=box-shadow%20inset&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="box-shadow inset" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_wWONrG"></iframe>

The results of the execution in the example appear to be upside down, as opposed to the shadow effect of `outset`.

Shadows appear inside the box to which `inset` is applied, in opposite corners of the box.

To sum up, it is okay to think that the x and y axes change when the inset is applied.

In other words, the `inset` setting changes the horizontal, longitudinal, and lateral values, the longitudinal positive values are expressed to the left, the negative values to the right, and the lateral positive values to the top, and the negative values to the bottom.
