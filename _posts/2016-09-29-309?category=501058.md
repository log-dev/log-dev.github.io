core pattern of javaScript constructor function

JavaScript is quite flexible because there are no classes.

This is because you don`t need to know about objects in advance, such as `blueprints` of classes.

However, JavaScript also has a constructor function that has a syntax similar to creating class-based objects such as Java.

### Creating objects with constructor functions

When you create objects, you can use the constructor function that you create, or you can use built-in constructors such as Object(), Date(), String().

The following example illustrates two ways to create the same object.

```js
// First Method - Using Object Literals
var car = { goes : 'far'};

// Alternative - Use built-in constructor
// WARNING: This method is anti-pattern.
var car = new Object();
car.goes = 'far';
```

As you can see, the obvious benefit of the first object literal notation is that it is shorter.

It also clearly shows that objects are just deformable hashes and are not something special that must be baked by any `cooking` (i.e., from a class).

This is also one of the advantages of a pattern that creates objects in literature.

Literal notation also prevents valid range discrimination.

If you used the constructor function, the interpreter must go back and search for the valid range from the location where you called `Object()` to the global object constructor, because the constructor function may have the same name in the region valid range.

### Object constructor's trap

When object literals are available, there is no reason to write `new Object()` constructors, but you will need to be aware of their `features` because they can inherit legacy code written by others. (That`s why we shouldn`t use a constructor after all.)

The function of the problem is that the `Object()` constructor can receive the factor. Depending on the value passed to the factor, the constructor function can delegate the creation of an object to another embedded constructor, which may result in a different object being returned than the one being enlarged.

The following are some examples of passing numbers, strings, and Boolean values to `new Object(), which return objects created with different constructors than expected:

```js
'// Warning: All anti-patterns

// Empty Object
var o = new Object();
console.log(o.constructor === Object); // true

// Numeric objects
var o = new Object(1);
console.log(o.constructor === Number); // true
o.toFixed(2); // '1.00'

// String object
var o = new Object('I am a String');
console.log(o.constructor === String); // true
// A typical object does not have a method called substring() in it, and it is in a demographic string object.
console.log(typeof o.substring); // 'function'

// Called Object
var o = new Object(ture);
console.log(o.constructor === Boolean); // true
```

### User-defined constructor function

You can also create objects by creating your own constructor function without writing object literal patterns or built-in constructor functions.

Take a look at the following example:

```js
var Person = function (name) {
this.name = name;
this.say = function () {
return 'I am ' + this.name;
};
};

var jaehee = new Person('jaehee');
jaehee.say(); // 'I am jaehee'
```

The code above defines the User Person constructor function.

This pattern is quite similar to how Java uses a class called Person to create objects.

But even though the grammar is similar, JavaScript has no class, and the person is just a normal function.

When you invoke the constructor function with `new`, the following happens within the function:

- An empty object (not in fact an empty object) is created. This object can be referenced by the variable "this" and inherits the prototype of the function.
- Properties and methods are added to objects referenced by this.
- If no other object is returned explicitly at the end, this object referenced as this is returned.

In other words, it goes as follows.

```js
var Person = function (name) {
// Creates a new object with object literature.
// var this = {};

// Add properties and methods.
this.name = name;
this.say = function () {
return 'I am ' + this.name;
};

// returns this.
// return this;
};
```

In this example, we simply added a method called say() to this.

This results in a new function being created in memory each time you invoke new Person(). The method called say() does not vary by instance, so it is obviously inefficient.

It is better to add this method to the Person`s prototype.

```js
Person.prototype.say = function () {
return 'I am ' + this.name;
};

```

There is one more thing to mention in the sense of being fully prepared.

First, inside the constructor, the following is said to happen:

```js
// var this = {};
```

And that`s not all. Because `empty` objects are not really empty.

This object inherits the person`s prototype.

That is, it is closer to the following code:

```js
// var this = Object.create(Person.prototype);
```

### Return value for constructor

Invoking the constructor function with new always returns the object.

The default value is this referenced object.

If you did not add any properties or methods within the constructor function, an `empty` (i.e., empty` object will be returned except that inherited from the constructor`s prototype).

The constructor implicitly returns this even if the return statement is not written within the function.

However, you can explicitly specify the object to be the return value.

You can create a new object in the following example to refer to this and see it returned.

```js
var Objectmark = function () {
// The constructor has decided to return another object.
// The following 'namme' Properties are ignored.
this.name = 'This is it';

// create a new object and return it.
var that = {};
that.name = "And that's that";
return that;
};

// TEST
var o = Objectmark();
console.log(o.name); // "And that's that"
```

So in the constructor, any object (as long as it`s an object)You can return it. If you attempt to return something that is not an object (for example, a string or false pack), the error does not occur, but it is just ignored and the object referenced by this is returned instead.

### pattern forcing new

As mentioned earlier, constructors are called with new and are still nothing but functions.

So what happens if we skip new when we call the constructor?

Grammar errors or runtime errors do not occur, but logical anomalies may result in unexpected results.

If you omit new, this inside the constructor will point to the global object (this will point to the window in the browser).

Inside the constructor, this.When you call this constructor without new if you have code such as member, a new property is actually created on the global object named member.

This property can be accessed through window.member or just member. As you know, the global namespace must always be kept clean, so this behavior is highly undesirable.

```js
// constructor
function Coffee() {
this.tastes = 'dalcom';
}

// New Object
var morning_coffee = new Coffee();
console.log(typeof morning_coffee); // 'object'
console.log(morning_coffee.tastes); // 'dalcom'
```

```js
'// Anti-Pattern
// 'new' is omitted
var morning_coffee = Coffee();
console.log(typeof morning_coffee); // 'undefined'
console.log(window.tastes); // 'dalcom'
```

Naming Rules

The simplest alternative is to use naming conventions.

This means that the first letter of the constructor function name is capitalized (Myconstructor), and the first letter of the `typical` function and method is to use lowercase letters (myFunction).

Use that

It is also quite helpful to follow naming conventions, but this only recommends the correct behavior, but does not enforce it.

Let`s take a look at the pattern that allows the constructor to always act as the constructor.

Instead of adding all members to this, you are adding all members to that and then returning that.

```js
function MyConstructor() {
var that = {};
thatname = 'jaehee';
return that;
}
```

If the object is as simple as the code above, you don`t need to create a local variable called that, but you can return the object through the object literal as follows:

```js
function MyConstructor() {
return {
name : 'jaehee'
}
}
```

Any of the above MyConstructor() implementations will always return the object regardless of how it is called.

```js
var first = new MyConstrutor(),
second = MyConstrutor();

console.log(first.name); // 'jaehee'
console.log(second.name); // 'jaehee
```

However, the problem with the pattern above is that the connection with the prototype will be broken.

This means that members added to the MyConstructor() prototype will not be available on the object.

### The constructor calling itself.

To solve the problems of the aforementioned patterns and to make the prototype`s properties available for instance objects, the following approaches should be considered:

Within the constructor, you determine if this is an instance of that constructor, otherwise you are calling yourself back with new.

```js
function MyConstrutor() {
if(!(this instanceof MyConstrutor)) {
return new MyConstrutor();
}

this.name = 'jaehee';

}

MyConstrutor.prototype.anotherName = true;

// Call Confirmation
var first = new MyConstrutor(),
second = MyConstrutor();

console.log(first.name); // 'jaehee'
console.log(second.name); // 'jaehee'

console.log(first.anotherName);
console.log(second.anotherName);
```

Another general-purpose way to determine an instance is to compare the constructor name with `arguments.callee` instead of hardcoding it.

```js
function MyConstrutor() {

if(!(this instanceof arguments.callee)) {
return new arguments.callee();
}

this.name = 'jaehee';

}
```

This is a pattern that takes advantage of the fact that when all functions are called, an object called `arguments` is created internally, which contains all the factors passed to the function.

The property called `callee` in `arguments` refers to the function called.
