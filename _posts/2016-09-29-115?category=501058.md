What is a reference?

### Replication

The result is natural. Because the change in the value is variable b, the value contained in variable a remains the same.

The value of variable b is a duplicate of the value of variable a.

In other words, b has another separate data 1 by copying 1.

### References and Variables

There is an amazing difference. We only changed the id value of the object in variable b to 2, but the value of a.id also became 2.

Because we created and assigned a new object to b, the object b no longer looks at a, but the object b looks at the new object.

### Functions and References

Let`s take a look at how the parameters of the method, which is a kind of variable assignment, work.

It`s a little complicated, so you have to look at it carefully.

The following is the behavior when the raw data type is passed over to the factor:

The following code works when a reference type is passed over to a factor:

The value passed to parameter b of the function func is object a.

Parameter b is a reference to object a (reference).

Changing the property of this value also affects a because changing the property of b is a modification to the object to which it belongs.
