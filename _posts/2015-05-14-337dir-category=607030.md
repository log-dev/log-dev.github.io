I summarized what I was curious about Fabicon.

### Introducing the favicon

Pavicon is an icon that is displayed on the top tab when a web page is accessed. This icon is also used to publish web pages as a favorite. It is similar to the concept of a logo representing a website and also reveals the nature of the site.

Recently, the appearance of touch icons and tile icons has added to the confusion, and the size of the fabicon optimized for each device has been reset, causing difficulties for developers.

### Pavicon Preferences

Since its introduction to Internet Explorer in 1999, Fabicon`s specifications have remained largely unchanged, mostly in the domain`s root directory in the form of an icon file.

With cross-browsing in mind, the setup is completed by placing a multiple size1 "favicon.ico" file in the root directory of his web account, with images of 16x16 and 32x32, without writing any HTML code.

This method works with all desktop browsers/version (including IE6) except for SeaMonkey browsers.

CMS also uses a theme or image directory.

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/path/to/favicon.ico">

```

Traditionally, the favicon.ico file is a 16x16 icon (ICO) file in the 16-color, 24-bit alpha transparency format. Recent Fabicon supports 32x32, which is properly reduced and represented by all major popular browsers. In IE10, a 32x32 icon is used in the address bar.

When using ICO files, it is recommended to include the following sizes:

| Size | Purpose |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 16x16 | IE9 Address bar, Jump List/Toolbar/Overlay at fixed site |
| 32x32 | IE's New Tab Page, Taskbar Button in Windows 7 and above, Safari Read Later Sidebar
| 48x48 | Windows Site Icon |

If you want to set it up more perfectly and you don`t care about the extra capacity increase of 1~3kb, you can include the size below.

| Size | Purpose |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 24x24 | IE9 Pinned Site Browser UI |
| 64x64 | Windows site icon, Safari from HiDPI/Retina Read later sidebar |

### Additional Pavicon Settings

Touch icons can be specified on iOS 2.0 and Android 2.1 and later. If only one high resolution icon (152x152) is prepared, the size of the icon changes at low resolution. However, adding an icon to the device`s home screen can negatively affect performance.

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" href="path/to/favicon-152.png">

```

IE10 The mat adds a tile icon (similar to an Apple-touch-icon) which is displayed on the start screen when visitors pin it. The size of the tile icon is a 144x144 PNG file, which requires a transparent background to achieve the best results.

```html
<meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#FFFFFF">
<meta name="msapplication-TileImage" content="/path/to/favicon-144.png">

```

You can modify `content=` #ffffffff` with the color of the tile you want.

### Favision PNG file support points

Chrome, Firefox, Opera 7+, and Safari all support PNG Fabicon, but Chrome and Safari ignore PNG Fabicon and use it regardless of the order of declaration if the ICO Fabicon is specified together. In other words, Chrome and Safari ignore PNG Fabicon when they use ICO files for IE that does not support PNG Fabicon.

favicion.ico > favicon.png

```html
<!-- Chrome, Safari, IE -->
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico">

<!-- Firefox, Opera (Chrome and Safari say thanks but no thanks) -->
<link rel="icon" href="path/to/favicon.png">

```

ICO Pavicon supports multiple sizes, so it can be used with multiple size icons in one ICO file, but PNG Fabicon cannot. For that reason, each required size should be declared as follows.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon-16.png" sizes="16x16">
<link rel="icon" href="favicon-32.png" sizes="32x32">
<link rel="icon" href="favicon-48.png" sizes="48x48">
<link rel="icon" href="favicon-64.png" sizes="64x64">
<link rel="icon" href="favicon-128.png" sizes="128x128">

```

When using PNG Fabicon, how does the browser determine which Fabicon to use?

- Firefox and Safari use the last available Pavicon.
- Chrome for Mac uses a 32x32 pavicon if it is not an ICO-formatted pavicon.
- Chrome for Windows uses ICO Fabicon unless 16x16 is first declared.
- If none of the above options are available, both Chrome uses the first declared Pavicon, while Firefox and Safari use the last declared one. In fact, Chrome for Mac only uses the 32x32 Fabicon to ignore the 16x16 Fabicon and reduce the size to 16x16 on non-retina devices.
- Opera will randomly select one of the available icons.

### Favicon hands-on organization

At least prepare the ICO file below.

| Size | File Name | Purpose |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| 16x16

Even if it slows down a bit, if it is going to consider iOS and Android, it will prepare PNG files as below.

| Size | File Name | Purpose |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 152x152 | favicon-152.png | Typically, the size is automatically reduced depending on the icons and devices used in iOS and Android. |

If you want to set up a more complete Fabicon, please refer to the table below and prepare the PNG file.

| Size | File Name | Purpose |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 32x32 | favicon-32.png | Some old but too old Chrome does not handle ICO properly. |
| 57x57 | favicon-57.png | Standard iOS Home Screen (iPad Touch, first generation of iPhone 3G) |
| 72x72 | favicon-72.png | iPad Home Screen Icon |
| 96x96 | favicon-96.png | Google TV Icon |
| 120x120 | favicon-120.png | iPhone Retina touch icon (Change for iOS 7: up from 114x114) |
| 128x128 | favicon-128.png | Chrome Webstore Icon |
| 144x144 | favicon-144.png | Tile with pinned IE10 mats |
| 152x152 | favicon-152.png | iPad Retina Touch Icon (Change for iOS 7: up from 144x144) |
| 195x195 | favicon-195.png | Opera Speed Dial Icon |
| 228x228 | favicon-228.png | Opera Coast 아이콘 |

### Favicon and IE browser reminders

- IE8–10 shows the Pavicon on the first visit to the page.
- IE7 ignores the first visit and marks the Pavicon on the revisit.
- IE6 bookmarks the site and re-open the browser to display it. IE6 deletes the Pavicon whenever the browser cache is deleted, and does not display the Pavicon until the site is re-booked or somehow reloaded.

### Forced refreshing of favicon

It is generally not necessary, but it takes into account when pavicon is not displayed during development or as a refresh.

- Delete the browser cache (Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R).
- If IE, close and reopen the browser.
- If you are still struggling, try opening a new tab or refer to How do I force a favicon refresh.
- Temporarily add explicit HTML tags and query strings. Let`s remove it after the confirmation is complete.
HTML
`<link rel="shortcut icon" href="http://www.yoursite.com/favicon.ico?v=2">
<link rel="icon" sizes="16x16 32x32" href="/favicon.ico?v=2">
`
