Before I start learning PHP in earnest, I will summarize the basic contents.

### How the Web Works

The sequence of processes that occur when a domain (www.php.net) is entered into the address bar of a web browser is shown below.

- The domain address entered by the client (web browser) is converted to IP via DNS server (understanding DNS).
- Access the Web server, the destination of the translated IP address (64.71.164.5), and forward the information of the request file through the URL (when you request the URL www.php.net, automatically locate the file, such as www.php.net/index.html or www.php.net/index.php, depending on the web server`s settings).
- The web server processes the files it finds and delivers the results to the web browser.
- A web browser interprets the results it receives and shows them to the user.

Requests for URLs delivered to the HTTP protocol are returned from the server for each status code, which is referred to below.

| Status Code | Meaning | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 200 | OK | Indicates that the request was completed normally. |
| 302 | Found | Indicates that the requested resource temporarily belongs to another URI. It is used for redirection. |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Indicates user authentication failed. |
| 403 | Forbidden | Indicates that the server refused to execute the request because it did not have access. |
| 404 | Not Found | Indicates that no matching resource was found for the request URI. |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Indicates that an error occurred during the execution of the server-side program. |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Indicates a temporary serviceability caused by excessive connectivity. |

### Static vs Dynamic Web Pages

Web pages can only be configured with HTML, but they say they serve static content because they only show responses to requests. On the other hand, server-side scripts such as PHP can be used to store and print data using databases, and reconstruct HTML to dynamically add or modify pages as requested, allowing users to print desired results in many ways. In other words, dynamic web page implementation is possible.

### History of PHP

The current version of PHP is the PHP 7 version. However, it would be right to think that PHP 7 is not being used most actively, and it is at a time of transition from PHP 5 to 7 versions. The history of PHP is recorded in detail in the history of PHP and PHP related projects.

### PHP Definition

PHP was originally an abbreviation for Personal Home Pages, but was recently used to refer to Hypertext Preprocessor.

- PHP is a scripting language that runs on the server side, and at the request of the client (web browser), the server interprets and executes PHP and returns the results back to the client.
- PHP extends pages written only in PHP, pages consisting of PHP and HTML, and pages consisting of HTML only.It can be recognized as a PHP page using php.
- PHP grammar is easy to learn because it is similar to those of C, Java, Perl, etc.
- PHP is run on a server, converted to HTML, and sent to the browser, so the client cannot see the PHP code, but only the HTML as a result of the execution.
- PHP can run PHP without a server or browser through command line scripting.
- PHP has a faster speed than CGI in the past, as it is common to operate as a module on a web server.
