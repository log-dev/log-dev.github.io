Flex Box Layout

In this posting, I would like to introduce the most comprehensive grid layout of the new layout modules, as well as a flexible layout module or a module called Flexbox 1, which is a new layout designed to implement more complex web pages and applications.

This flex box can handle a lot of everyday issues and has the potential to dramatically change the layout of web pages.

With the advent of Flexboxes, we are able to provide solutions that reflect the basic concepts that CSS pursues while addressing the challenges of layout, such as flexibility or space distribution.

While the support rate for older browsers such as IE is still insufficient, mobile is now available and is a module that provides a good direction for the web to move forward.

From now on, let`s take a look at exactly what the flex box is and what functions it has, and look at the properties and values of each of the modules.

### What is a Flex box?

What exactly does Flexbox layout mean and what are the advantages?

The most basic model that forms this layout is related to flex containers. The content of this container is called flex items, and the most basic function of this flex item is its ability to "flex" size.

This means that you can adjust the length of the horizontal or vertical depending on the space, and you can adjust the size based on the ratio to the available space.

Another impressive feature of flex items is that they can set visual order and direction.

Simply put, the flexbox layout module is not restricted to accessibility because it allows flex items to appear in any order or direction we want and operates independently regardless of the actual marked-up sequence.

The flex box module also has the ability to control alignment.

The width and spacing can be equal, the height of the hem can be equal, and the vertical alignment can be easily controlled.

The Flexbox module has a lot of new attributes and values to review, but if you`re ready for the coming future, you`ll be using this Flexbox to deal with a number of layout issues.

### display: flex (configuring the flex formatting environment)

The flexbox module presents two new values for display.

These values can convert elements into block or inline flex containers.

Although this module presents a lot of properties, it may be necessary to learn about existing properties (legacy) because the flex properties used by IE and other browsers differ slightly in their usage.

For example, IE specifies display: flexbox and other browsers specifies display:box. Alternatively, you can use it with a prefix (vendor-prefix).

Please refer to the link below to learn more about flexbox.

- CSS Flexbox Layout Specification
- Flexbox Complete Guide (css-tricks)
- Learn the difference between new and old versions of flexbox
- The best way to support older and newer versions of flexbox browsers
- IE flexbox reference

As mentioned earlier, flexbox`s content (flex items) can be located in any direction, can be dynamically changed order, or can be automatically sized and positioned within the available space.

When this property is applied to an element, these display values create a new flex formatting context for the content, which becomes a flex item.

When you configure the flexbox layout, you assign this property to the parent element that surrounds the content (flex item).

```undefined
<div class="container">
<nav></nav>
<section></section>
<aside></aside>
</div>

<style>
.container {display:flex;}
</style>

```

The above display: flex; rule has converted the container into a flex container, and this code configures the flex formatting environment.

The contents in the flex container ( <nav>, <section>, and <aside>) are flex items.

Generally, to arrange items of the same size well, each item must be in float state, give an inflexible height value, and clear the float state to prevent the container from being disturbed. However, it allows much more flexbox functions to be activated as well as sorting with the flex values previously suggested. (Keep explaining the flexbox functions.)

- IE10 should be used with `-ms-display: flexbox`.

### flex-direction - orientation, flow, visual ordering

First, let`s take a look at the concept of the direction and flow in which elements are constructed in the flex format environment, and then how the flexbox is involved in the aesthetic part of the layout.

The attribute `flex-direction` controls the flow direction of an element, that is, whether the flex items should be aligned (arrayed) in the right, left, down, or up directions.

The default value for the flex-direction property is row, which allows flex items to be listed based on the Western way of writing (left-to-right, top-to-bottom writing).

```css
.container {
display: -ms-flexbox;
display: flex;
flex-direction: row;
width: 200px;
}
```

This value should be specified in the flex container, not in the flex item, because it controls the flow direction of the entire flex item.

flex-direction property value

- row : default, list from left to right. (→)
- row-reverse: list from right to left. (←)
- column: List items vertically from top to bottom. (↓)
- column-reverse: list items vertically from bottom to top. (↑)

### flex-wrap

`flex-wrap` specifies the property that controls how flex items change columns, i.e., whether the flex item is wrapped or not.

When this value is applied, the items are not divided into multiple columns, and the items are all wrapped in one column by adjusting the width.

In other words, as the number of items increases, they are lined up in a row without changing the column. (white-space: similar to nowrap)

```css
div {
display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
-webkit-flex-wrap: wrap; /* Safari 6.1+ */
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

This property must also be specified in the flex container.

flex-wrap attribute value

- nowrap : Specifies that flex items are not broken by default.
- Wrap : Allows flex items to heat multiple lines in a container.
- Wrap-reverse : The sort (list) direction caused by the wrapper is listed in reverse.
- initial : Sets this property to default value.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

### flex-flow

This property is a short property that specifies the flex-direction and flex-wrap values discussed earlier.

`flex-flow` can specify two factors (parameters) in any order, and it is possible to omit either of them.

```css
div {
display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
-webkit-flex-flow: row-reverse wrap; /* Safari 6.1+ */
display: flex;
flex-flow: row-reverse wrap;
}
```

Specifies this property in the flex container.

flex-flow attribute value

- flex-direction : You can use the flex-direction property value regardless of the factor order. (Direction of Flex Items)
- flex-wrap : You can use the flex-wrap attribute value regardless of the factor order.

### flex

flex can specify the length of the flex items inside the flex container and the free space allocated between each item is determined by three factors:

That is, the initial default width, expansion factor, and reduction factor.

In other words, specify the attribute value for the flex item with the abbreviated attributes of flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis to be introduced later.

The default is 01 auto.

```css
/* flex : flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis */
#main div {
-webkit-flex: 1; /* Safari 6.1+ */
-ms-flex: 1; /* IE 10 */
flex: 1;
}
```

This property must be specified in a flex entry, not in a flex container.

flex attribute value

- flex-grow : Specifies an incremental number for the width that the flex items will occupy.
- flex-shrink : Specifies a decreasing number for the width that the flex items will occupy.
- flex-basis : Specifies the length of the item.
- Auto : 11 is the same as auto.
- Initial : 01 auto is the same.
- None : It`s the same as 00 auto.

### flex-grow

The `flex-grow` property accepts a positive integer value, which controls how much of the remaining space should be distributed to the specified flex item.

This determines how much the item will expand compared to other items in the flex container.

The default value is 0.

```css
/* Safari 6.1+ */
div:nth-of-type(1) {-webkit-flex-grow: 1;}
div:nth-of-type(2) {-webkit-flex-grow: 3;}
div:nth-of-type(3) {-webkit-flex-grow: 1;}

/* Standard syntax */
div:nth-of-type(1) {flex-grow: 1;}
div:nth-of-type(2) {flex-grow: 3;}
div:nth-of-type(3) {flex-grow: 1;}
```

flex-grow property value

- number : Specifies the number of values to increase. The default value is 0.
- initial : Follow the default values for this property.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

### flex-shrink

The attribute `flex-shrink` also has an integer value. This determines how much less flex items will be compared to other items in the flex container when reclaiming insufficient space.

The default is 1.

```css
/* Safari 6.1+ */
div:nth-of-type(2) {
-webkit-flex-shrink: 3;
}

/* Standard syntax */
div:nth-of-type(2) {
flex-shrink: 3;
}
```

As with `flex-grow`, you must attribute the flex entry.

flex-shrink attribute value

- number : Specifies the number of values to decrease. The default is 1.
- initial : Follow the default values for this property.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

### flex-basis

The flex-basis property accepts the width value and sets the initial size of the flex entry. The remaining space is then distributed based on the growth/shrink factor.

This means that you specify the default value for the flex item, and the default value is auto.

```css
div:nth-of-type(2) {
-webkit-flex-basis: 80px; /* Safari 6.1+ */
flex-basis: 80px;
}
```

This value must also be specified in the flex entry.

Flex-basis property value

- number : You can specify the default value for flex items in length units such as px,pt, or % (percent stage).
- auto : By default, the length is the same as the flex item length.
- initial : Follow the default values for this property.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.
