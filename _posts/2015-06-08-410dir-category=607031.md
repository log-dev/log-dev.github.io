CSS3 includes box-shadowing elements (boxes) and text-shadowing letters. In the case of shadowing letters, the effect is minimal due to the leanness of the Korean font, but you can use the box-shaped shadowing as much as you want.

### text-shadow

Creates a shadow in the letter.

- CSS does not pass validation because it does not support IE9 version and supports its own proprietary attribute `filter: shadow`.
- Specifying the text-shadow property is not harmful even if there is a browser that does not support it. If there`s none, if there`s none, it`ll be rendered as none.

selector {text-shadow: color horizontal length vertical length spread; }

```css
.shadow { text-shadow:#999999 5px 5px 5px; }

```

선택자 { filter:shadow(color=색상, direction=방향, strength=크기); zoom:1; }

```css
.shadow { filter:shadow(color=#999999, direction=135, strength=4); zoom:1; }

```

The direction is the direction of the shadow. 0 means the top right, 45 means the top right, 90 means the bottom right, 135 means the bottom right, 180 means the bottom left, 225 means the bottom left, 270 means the top left, and 315 means the top left. The size is the shadow size specified in px.

In IE, the shadow effect is only applicable by specifying zoom:1. IE6 can only be applied with a filter effect if there is a block element to assign layout properties. The specified zoom:1 results in a layout property. Layout properties exist only in IE. When bordering block elements with letter shadows, IE6 has a problem of double-laying shadows around the border and around the letters.

It is best demonstrated when dark text with non-white background is shaded in highlight colors (white or near).

```css
text-shadow: 0 1px 0 rgba(255, 255, 255, .75);

```

TEXT SHADOW

The descriptions of the shadow attribute values separated by commas can have multiple shadow effects.

```css
text-shadow: 0px 1px #ffffff, 4px 4px 0px #dad7d7;

```

TEXT SHADOW

```css
object.style.textShadow="2px 2px #ff0000"

```

### box-shadow

A property added to CSS3 creates one or more shadows in the box.

```css
div {box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;}

```

- Write offset-x, offset-y, blur, spread, color, and insert.
- Several shadow attributes can be applied separately by commas (,).
- The omitted length value is zero.

- offset-x: required as offset value of horizontal shadow.
- offset-y: required for offset value of vertical shadow.
- blur: An optional value indicates the degree to which shadow edges are treated smoothly. 0 means the sharpest.
- spread : indicates the size of the shadow and is an optional value.
- color : An optional value that specifies the CSS color value.
- inset : An optional keyword defining the inner shadow.

Examples associated with box-shadow are more likely to experience effects in CSS drop-shadows without images.
