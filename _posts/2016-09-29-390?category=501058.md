Defining Object Objects

The method of creating objects using object literal can be combined to define and create structures for objects, which makes the process of creating objects and creating structures more simplified using new and object constructors.

This simplifies the code and increases readability.

### Object Literals

Let`s now learn how to create objects using object literals.

The following methods are often used as object-generated syntax because of the simplicity of the representation:

```js
var obj = {
Name: 'jaehee', // Wrap the member's name in quotation marks like 'name'
age : 10,
increaseAge : function (i) {
this.age + i;
}
};
```

The code above uses the object literal representation `{ ...}` to create an object object object.

The members of the entire object are separated by a comma (,) inside the `{ }. Again, each member is a colon (:), separated by its name and initial value.

The internal process of creating objects using object literals and creating objects using the Object constructor is the same.

Once the Object constructor is used to create the first Object object, it dynamically adds the members defined in the literal representation.

These defined members are all externally accessible public members.

This method cannot implement private members. We will discuss how to implement private members later.

This used by the object literal representation points to the object created with { }.

Therefore, `this.age` is `obj.`It is the same expression as `age`.

If you want to create an object object with no members, you can do the following:

```js
'varobj = {}; // Create an object with a default member of an object'
```

This code is the same as the following code:

```js
var obj = new Object();
```

Objects with the same structure as obj mentioned earlier can be created using object literal representations in the following ways:

```js
var obj = {};
obj.name = 'jaehee';
obj.age = 10;
obj.increaseAge = function (i) {
this.age + i;
};
```

You can also use object literals to make nested representations that assign different objects to properties.

The following code assigns another object to the parent property of the obj object:

```js
'var anotherName = 'JavaScript';
var obj = {
name :'jaehee',
age : 10,
parent : {
"Hong Gil-dong,"
job : 'Freelancer'
},
etc : function() {
this.Another name for the name + ": " + anotherName
}
};

```

You can access the job properties of the parent as follows:

```js
console.log(obj.parent.job)
```

You can also assign the value of an attribute in an object literal as well as the value returned by the calculated expression, as well as the fixed value.

If you look at libraries such as jQuery, you can see that they use object literal representations more frequently than new objects.

The jQuery library code partial creation is as follows:

```js
jQuery.fn = {
constructor : jQuery,
init : function() { ... },
selector : "",
length : 0,
size : function() { ... },
toArray : function() { ... },
each : function(callback, args) { ... },
ready : function(fn) { ... }
};

```

When you invoke a function, you often see code that is also constructed using object literal representations.

Suppose you have the following defined functions:

```js
function OpenWindow(options) {
var url = options.path || 'http://e-rooms.net';
var name = options.windowName || 'eroomWindow';
var option = options.windowOptions || 'width=100,height=100';
window.open(url, name, option);
}
```

In the code that calls the preceding function, you can configure the options object using the object literal to pass the factor used to call the function.

```js
var options = {
path: 'http://e-rooms.tistory.com',
windowName: 'jaeheeWindow',
windowOptions : 'width=500, height=500'
};
OpenWindow(options);
```

Inside the function, check that the options that receive the factors have path, windowName, and windowOptions properties.

You will use each default value that does not exist.

### Define Custom Objects

There is a way to create objects using classes in a general object-oriented language.

The following code defines a class called Person in Java.

```js
public class Person {
public string Name;
// constructor
public Person(name, age) { this.Name = name; ... }
}

// Create Object
mySon = new Person(...);
```

You can use the keyword class to group the code that defines the structure of the object together with the code that performs the initialization operation.

In a general object-oriented language, the class, Person, in this way, incorporates all of the code responsible for defining and initializing the structure.

In a general object-oriented language, you cannot add any other members after you create an object.

It also provides a technical method for adding members at runtime by language, but it is an independent function provided only in the language, which violates object-oriented ideas.

Object Definition

To define custom objects, JavaScript uses function instead of the keyword class.

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
}
```

The code above is no different from the normal function.

If you use the function keyword like this when you define an object, what is the difference from the function you use to define a function?

The function of the function is practically the same as the function of the object when it is created.

The JavaScript function can be used by the same function as a callable element or as an element that creates another object.

The role to be used depends on the surrounding execution environment, that is, the operator.

When used in conjunction with `new`, it is used as a role to create an instance in memory.

If you simply use the () operator without new to invoke it like Person (`Jaehee`) it is used like a normal function.

Thus, with an implicit promise, the programming world recommends that regular functions start with lowercase letters and constructors start with uppercase letters.

Define Members

In JavaScript, defining a member of an object is quite different from normal object-oriented languages.

JavaScript uses `this` to add members.

this.name = name;

This code defines the public property named name on the Person object.

If you want to define a method, you can use an anonymous function.

```js
this.setNewName = function (name) {
this.name = name;
}
```

The following person constructors have members defined:

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name;
this.setNewName = function (name) {
this.name = name;
}
}
```

Create Object

You can now create objects by invoking the previously defined person constructor with `new`.

```js
var mySon = new Person('jaehee');
```

The constructor defines the member structure of the initial object and initializes its value.

JavaScript has a variety of syntax for calling the Person constructor using `new`.

```js
var mySon = new Person('jaehee');
var mySon = new Person(); // constructor parameter name is set to undefined
var mySon = new person; // constructor parameter name set to undefined'
```

When using a constructor with `new`, you can omit the `()` operator as in the third syntax.

When you invoke a constructor, if you create an instance without factors, such as new Person(), new Person, the constructor`s parameter name is set to undefined.

The parameter of the function that did not receive a value from the outside is initialized to undefined.

The characteristics of these general functions are applied to the constructor.

Members defined by this are defined as public members of the object currently being created.

Members defined by this will exist separately for each instance created by new.

Therefore, in this article, the member added using this inside the constructor is described as an "instance member".

An instance member is a concept that contrasts with a prototype member you will encounter later encounter.

A prototype member is a member that can be shared by all objects (instances) created with the same constructor, and if that value changes, it affects all objects created with that constructor.

In contrast, changes to instance members can affect only those objects.

In fact, JavaScript is centered on prototype members.

When designing objects or designing inheritance, they are all based on prototype objects.

Therefore, JavaScript is a prototype-based object-oriented language.
