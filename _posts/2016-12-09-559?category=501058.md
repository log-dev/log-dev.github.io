JavaScript Prototype

JavaScript has no concept of class. So it`s a prototype-based language that copies existing objects and creates new objects. The prototype-based language uses prototypes that are object prototypes to create new objects. These created objects can also be circular to another object.

Prototype allows you to expand objects and do object-oriented programming.

The prototype can be interpreted in two main ways.

Prototype properties referencing prototype objects and hidden links referenced by the object member Proto properties.

To understand the difference between these two, you need to understand the internal structure of the JavaScript function and the object.

In this article, we`ll start with JavaScript`s function and object internal structure and learn about prototypes.

### Internal structure of functions and objects

JavaScript defines a function, and once you enter the parsing phase, there is an internally performed action.

The function member has a prototype property. This property references a prototype object in a function name created elsewhere.

The constructor property, a member of a prototype object, has an internal structure that references the function.

Express as shown in Figure 1 below.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
function Person (){ }
```

When a function called Person without any properties is defined and you enter the parsing phase, the Person function `Prototype Properties` refers to a prototype object.

The `constructor` property, a prototype object member, has a structure that references the Person function.

What you need to know here is that the prototype object referenced by the prototype property of the Person function is an operator named new and an object that is circular to all objects created by the Person function.

Remember that all created objects reference.

Express as shown in Figure 2 below.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
function Person(){}

var joon = new Person();
var jisoo = new Person();
```

In JavaScript, the default data types Boolean, number, string, and special values null, undefined are all objects.

The user-defined function is also an object, and the one created by the operator new is also an object.

The object has a non-standard property.

This property refers to a prototype object as a hidden link that is the prototype used to create the object.

### What is a prototype object?

When you define a function, a prototype object that is created elsewhere is an object that is circular to another object.

All objects have access to prototype objects.

Prototype objects can also dynamically add members at runtime.

Any object created by copying the same circular can use the added member.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
function Person(){}

var joon = new Person();
var jisoo = new Person();

Person.prototype.getType = function (){
return "human";
};

console.log(joon.getType()); // 인간
console.log(jisoo.getType()); // 인간
```

The source 6 line above added members using the prototype property in the function.

When you add a function called getType() to a prototype object, you can also use the added member on the object that was created before you added the member.

Jun and jisoo objects created using the same prototype can use getType().

What you need to know here is that when you add, modify, or delete members to a prototype object, you should use the prototype attribute in the function.

However, when you read a prototype member, you access the prototype attribute or object name in the function.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
joon.getType = function (){
return "people";
};

console.log(joon.getType()); // 사람
console.log(jisoo.getType()); // 인간

jisoo.age = 25;

console.log(joon.age); // undefined
console.log(jisoo.age); // 25
```

The source 1 line above modified the getType() return value to people using the jun object.

And if you call getType() from jun and jisoo respectively, the result of the call using jun object is output to human, and the result of the call to jisoo is output to human.

When you modify a member of a prototype object using the created object, you do not modify the member in the prototype object, but add the member to your object.

When you invoke getType() using the jun object, you do not invoke getType() of the prototype object. call to getType() added to jun object.

When modifying a member of a prototype object, modify it using the prototype property of the function, such as adding members.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
Person.prototype.getType = function (){
return "people";
};

console.log(jisoo.getType()); // 사람
```

When you see the source above, modify the getType() return value to human using the prototype property of the function. And as a result of calling using jisoo object, a person comes out.

In conclusion, a prototype object is a circular object for the creation of a new object. Space commonly referenced by objects created in the same circle.

When you read a member of a prototype object, you can access it through the prototype property of the object or function.

However, adding, modifying, or deleting must be accessed through the prototype property of the function.

### What is a prototype?

Everything in JavaScript except for the default data type is an object. To create an object, create the object using the prototype object, the prototype used to create it.

Within the object created, there is a hidden link that refers to the prototype object, which means the prototype from which the attribute `__proto__` created itself.

Define this hidden link as a prototype.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
function Person(){}

var joon = new Person();
```

The hidden link that points to the prototype object is called a prototype by the __proto__ (non-standard) attribute that is a member of the above figure jun object.

They said that prototypes can be interpreted in two main ways.

The prototype property, a member of a function, is a property that references a prototype object.

The function and the new operator meet to specify the prototype object of the object created.

The __proto__ (non-standard) property within an object means a prototype as a hidden link that references the prototype object that created it.

JavaScript has hidden links that allow you to access prototype object members.

So if you set this prototype link to be referenced to a user-defined object, you can reuse code and do object-oriented programming.

### Reuse of Code

The word that comes to mind when you think of code reuse is inheritance. Java, which has the concept of a class, can inherit duplicate code and recycle code.

But in JavaScript, it`s a prototype-based language with no classes.

So we can reuse code using prototypes.

There are two main categories of this method. There are classic and prototypal methods.

The classical method is to reuse code using objects created by the new operator. Similar to how Java creates objects, it is called a classical method.

The prototypal method uses literal or Object.create() to create and expand objects.

JavaScript prefers the prototypal approach.

This is because it can be implemented more concisely than the classical method.

Examples 1 through 4 below are classic code reuse methods, and 5 show code reuse using the prototypal method Object.create().

1) Basic method

Creates an object using a function corresponding to the parent. A method that references a prototype property of a function corresponding to a child to an object created using the parent function.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name || "혁준";
}

Person.prototype.getName = function(){
return this.name;
};

function Korean(name){}
Korean.prototype = new Person();

var kor1 = new Korean();
console.log(kor1.getName()); // 혁준

var kor2 = new Korean("지수");
console.log(kor2.getName()); // 혁준
```

If you look at the source above, the function corresponding to the parent is Person. The prototype property in the child function Korean function was replaced with the object created by the parent function in line 10.

The __proto__ property of the kor object created using the Korean function and the new operator now refers to the object created using the parent function.

This object becomes a prototype object of all objects created using the Korean function.

kor1 does not have the properties name and getName(), but the prototype object corresponding to the parent has a name.

The parent of this prototype object has getName() and is available in kor1.

This method also has a disadvantage. You inherit both parent object properties and parent object prototype properties.

In most cases, the object`s own attributes are specific to a particular instance and cannot be reused, so you do not need them.

Also, even if you pass over a factor when you create a child object, it fails to hand over the factor when you create a parent object.

When creating the kor2 object in the second line at the bottom of the source, we gave it as an exponential as a factor in the Korean function.

When you call getName() after creating the object, it is likely to be output as an exponential, but the name contains the default value, Hyukjun, because the factor was not passed to the parent constructor.

You can also invoke the parent function whenever you create an object. But it`s very inefficient.

So the next method is to find out how to solve the problem of this method.

2) Borrow and write constructors

This method solves the problem with the default method, where the factors received from the child function could not be passed to the parent function.

How to bind a child object to this of the parent function.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name || "혁준";
}

Person.prototype.getName = function(){
return this.name;
};

function Korean(name){
Person.apply(this, arguments);
}

var kor1 = new Korean("지수");
console.log(kor1.name); // 지수
```

If you look at the source 10 line above, use the `apply` function inside the Korean function.

Bind this in the Person function area, the parent object, to this in the Korean function.

It copies all the parent`s attributes within the child function. Creates an object and outputs a name. When you create an object, you can see that it outputs a factor that you passed over.

In the default method, members of the parent object were inherited by reference.

However, there is a difference between borrowing a constructor and copying a parent object member into his own.

However, this method has a disadvantage that only this member of the parent object inherits. Therefore, the members of the prototype object of the parent object are not inherited.

If you look at the picture right above, you can see that the kor1 object does not have a link to the prototype object of the parent object.

3) Borrowing constructors and specifying prototypes

This method complements the problems of Method 1 and Method 2.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name || "혁준"; }

Person.prototype.getName = function(){
return this.name;
};

function Korean(name){
Person.apply(this, arguments);
}
Korean.prototype = new Person();

var kor1 = new Korean("지수");
console.log(kor1.getName()); // 지수
```

Bind the parent function this to the child function this at the source 9 line above.

You specified the child function prototype property on line 11 as an object created using the parent function.

Make it mine through a copy rather than having a reference to the parent object property. At the same time, a link to the prototype object of the parent object is referenced. You can also use prototype object members of a parent object.

Compared to the figure in the default method, you can see that the kor1 object does not have a name member, while the figure immediately above shows that it has a name member.

Compared to the figure in borrow constructor, the prototype link also references objects created by parent functions.

You can also see that the prototype object of the parent object is linked.

There is also a problem with this method.

Invoke the parent constructor twice. Unlike the borrow constructor write method, getName() is inherited properly, but for the name, it can also be seen in objects created using the kor1 object and the parent function.

4) Prototype sharing

This method is to share prototype objects without invoking the parent constructor once.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/xBoxReplace_250.png)

```js
function Person(name) {
this.name = name || "혁준";
}

Person.prototype.getName = function(){
return this.name;
};

function Korean(name){
this.name = name;
}
Korean.prototype = Person.prototype;

var kor1 = new Korean("지수");
console.log(kor1.getName()); // 지수
```

The prototype property of the child function was set as the object referenced by the prototype property of the parent function at the source 12 line above.

Objects created by the child function do not pass through objects created by the parent function, but create the object by specifying the prototype object of the parent function as the parent.

Because you do not inherit the contents of the parent function, you must create the part you want to inherit in the parent function`s prototype object to get the result you want.

Compared to the picture in Borrowing constructors and assigning prototypes, you can see that there are no parent functions in the middle, and the link is referenced as a prototype object of the parent function.

5) Prototype reuse

This method uses `Object.create()` to specify a prototype object at the same time as it is created.

This function passes over the object that the first parameter will use as the parent object, and the second parameter is the part that is added to the attribute of the child object that is returned as an optional parameter.

This function simplifies code recycling by specifying parent objects at the same time as you create them.

```js
var person = {
Type: "Human,"
getType : function(){
return this.type;
},
getName : function(){
return this.name;
}
};

var joon = Object.create(person);
joon.name = "혁준";

console.log(joon.getType()); // 인간
console.log(joon.getName()); // 혁준
```

The person corresponding to the parent object was created in an object literal fashion on the source 1 line above.

In line 11, the child object joon used the function `Object.create()` to take person over to the first parameter and create the joon object.

You created an object in a single line and inherited all the attributes of the parent object.

It`s simpler than the classical method that corresponds to number 1 through 4 above, and you don`t have to think about many situations.

JavaScript prefers the prototypal method to the classical method that uses new operators and objects created by functions.
