### CCZ-CROSS Skin Introduction

There was a request to share the skin that I was using before, so I reworked it and distributed it in a distributable form. Personally, it`s the last piece of work that supports older browsers and devices, and it`s a test piece that combines many useful ideas.

- Classic theme
- Reactive design supports a wide range of devices and browsers
- Some functions can be turned on/off due to changes in option values
- Add formatting styles to help you write

- Internet Explorer 7/8 on the Windows XP operating system
- Internet Explorer 9/11 on the Windows 7 operating system
- Internet Explorer 11 on the Windows 8.1 operating system
- Internet Explorer 11/Edge on the Windows 10 operating system
- Firefox Latest Version
- Chrome Latest Version
- Opera Latest Version
- iOS Safari
- Android 2.3.x or later internal browser
- Android Chrome

- CCZ-CROSS skin is distributed free of charge, and you can freely modify it and use it.
- It cannot be used for sales purposes.
- For the source related to thumbnail extraction, ishaiin referred to the source of thumbnail extraction of the skin being sold. Do not reuse it because it is not an open license.

I re-worked the skin as a distribution version and referred to many of the works that were submitted in the skin contest.

- T-story
- THINK MORE,
- Life is an egg.
- That`s the story.

### Setting Skin Options

The main.js within the images folder has triggers that allow you to set several options. When you open the main.js file with Notepad or other editor, you can find the syntax below at the beginning of the document.

```js
var setting = {

activeCate: true, //mark current category location
autoLink: true, //comments, automatic link to guest book
extendThumb: false, //thumbnail extension
newIcon: true, //new icon change status
preloader: false, //preload enabled
searchTag: true, //Show priority tags at search time
searchTagCount: 8, //number of priority tags to show
tbHide: true, //hide trackback
timeChange: true //change the date of the post, comments, and guest book

}

```

Each option is an `true` and `false` value and is active/disabled.

This is a newly created option to support the current location of categories provided by T-Story because they are poor. If T-Story provides the normal form afterwards, you can deactivate it.

This option converts characters in the link format (ex. http://www.tistory.com) into actual clickable links in comments and guestbooks. Blogs with a lot of comments can affect performance, and disable them if you want to avoid malicious link connections.

The option to add thumbnails of multimer services such as YouTube, Vimeo, Next TVPod, SoundCloud, and Daily Motion from the Home screen or category list. Activate it if you usually write using related services.

Option to change the NEW icon to announce a new article. The existing image-type icon has a limit to the vertical alignment, so I prepared it, but if you don`t want it, disable it.

The skin has parts that are changed to scripts, and FOUC processing is applied as a basis to hide the process of changing the content while it is exposed. However, if the loading is prolonged, the blank screen is exposed, so this option is provided so that you can replace it with a loading image according to your preference. When enabled, the image below is provided when loading the page.

We provide recommended search terms to show you when searching using popular tags. If the skin changes the tag to a popular tag by default, but it does not change, please change the sidebar tag in the order of popularity in the screen setting → screen output on the management page.

Set the number of recommended search terms to show when you activate the searchTag option above.

Hides content related to the woven text (trackback). Disable it if you are using a linked article.

- The woven writing area at the bottom of the body
- The woven area of the sidebar

The date format is the same as in 2015.09.07 to indicate the past time based on the present, such as three months ago and a few hours ago.

### Patch Notes

The download file above is being updated every time you modify it. I think it will be difficult for those who use it after modifying the skin, so I`m separately revealing the patch details.

Please let me know about the insufficient parts found while using the toner.

- Issues related to formatting, style and location alignment of designs - 2015.12.29/2015.12.31 Patch
- Questions that could not be filled out after writing comments and guest book - 2016.01.04 Patch
- Scanning is not working with Chrome browser on MAC operating system - Checking on T-Story side
- Exposure of category names causes malfunction (ex. C/C++) - `,` or `` if category names contain `/` characters
- If you do not see a list of categories and search results, - After applying the skin, go to the Screen Settings menu in the Admin page, and switch the number of screen text lists and display screens to List+Contents. Even if the display screen is already listed + content, change it in a different way, save it, and change it back to list + content.
- Updating the reporting function of T-Story prevents the existing date stamping function from functioning normally. Please refer to the update regarding it.
