It is about testing and introducing the distribution of Noto Sans as a web font. I hope it will be helpful for those who are considering using the web font.

### Introducing Noto Sans Webfont

The Noto Sans Webfont is produced by extracting only 2,350 Korean characters (KS X 1001 standard) that are frequently used in the Korean version of Noto Sans CJK KR to use the Noto Sans CJK as a webfont. This production process is described in detail to lighten and use the Hangeul Web font, which is used to share a Web font called NotoSans KR-Hestia (hereinafter referred to as Noto Sans Korean).

In addition, similar webfonts are distributed (called notokr) in the use of Noto Sans webfonts, and are slightly different compared to NotoSans KR-Hestia. Choose between the two and use them, but refer to the difference below. Noto Sans CJK is a free font, so there are no restrictions on using it as a web font.

The original version of Noto Sans can be downloaded from Google Noto Fonts.

### Noto Sans Korean

### Limits of Noto Sans Webfont

Rather than a problem with the Noto Sans web font, it is also a problem with the use of the web font in XP. A feature we commonly call Hinting does not seem to apply in XP. I don`t know the details of this, but it remains the same that XP is a stumbling block today. XP... it`s convenient to give up.

Noto Sans Korean does not apply in IE8 of XP. On the surface, it contains eot files that support this, but it is for people who use IE8 on Windows 7, not XP. No matter how it is applied, there are not many fonts that are properly represented unless hints are applied.

On the other hand, notokr is also applicable in IE8 of XP, but is not a hint as mentioned earlier.
