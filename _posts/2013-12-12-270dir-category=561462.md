After living without jQuery for a while, many changes have been made.

< 2013 - 12 - 12 Cleanup>

- jQuery is being developed in two versions: 2.x and 1.x. Version 2.x no longer supports IE 6, 7, and 8. The 1.x version supports IE 6, 7, and 8.
- There are many things that have disappeared or changed as jQuery is versioned up. In particular, in the 1.9 version, some of the past plugins created could malfunction due to changes, and new scripts were created to ensure compatibility with older versions of the API.
