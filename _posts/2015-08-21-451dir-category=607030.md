I thought I wrote it down somewhere, but I couldn`t find it, so I`m writing a new article. It is still used a lot for cross-browsing.

### Conditional Annotation Introduction

Conditional annotations are conditional statements that operate only below IE10, which are often used to insert features, files, designs, etc. for each IE browser.

If you write the appropriate conditions for the basic type as shown below and satisfy them, you will render the HTML code. The `<!--` part at the beginning of the phrase and the part where the last `>` is applied are ignored in the tablouser.

```html
<!--[if condition]>
HTML Code
<![endif]-->

```

Symbols used are:

- If it is not `[if!ie]`ie, it is not `!
- `lt`: Less than - e.g. `[if ltie 9]` If it`s smaller than `ie9`
- `lte`: Less than equal - e.g. `[if lteie 8]` If it is less than or equal to ie8
- `gt` : Greater than - e.g.) [if gtie 6]`i6
- `gte` : Greater than equal - e.g.) `[if gteie7]` equal to or equal to i7
- `() : preferential treatment
- `
- If `|` : or (or) - e.g. `[if(ie 7|(ie 8)]` - `ie7 or `ie8`, then `i8`.

### Utilize Conditional Annotations

In the past, HTML5 Boilerplate used the following conditional annotations for cross-browsing.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--[if lt IE 7]> <html class="lt-ie9 lt-ie8 lt-ie7" lang="ko"> <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 7]> <html class="lt-ie9 lt-ie8" lang="ko"> <![endif]-->
<!--[if IE 8]> <html class="lt-ie9" lang="ko"> <![endif]-->
<!--[if gt IE 8]><!--> <html class="no-js" lang="ko"> <!--<![endif]-->

```

- It was a method to control `<html>` elements by giving each browser a class name using conditional annotations.
- The phrase in the last line is a bit different from the existing syntax, where IE versions that meet the original conditions and other browsers also add `-->` conditional afterwards to satisfy the need to read at the same time. However, IE, which does not meet the conditions, will be rendered as soon as the conditions are finished and the `-->` part will be displayed on the screen, so the `-->` part will be changed to `<!-->` to annotate this part. The last part is the same reason.
- In a similar way, it also shows only phrases that correspond to specific browsers within `body`.

Because this method causes malfunction in X-UA-Compatible meta-tags for compatibility views, it is recommended to apply only after `head` tags.

It is also frequently used as a way to replace the features required by older IE browsers in terms of functionality.

```html
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="js/html5shiv.min.js">
<![endif]-->

```

Recently, a growing number of libraries and frameworks have eliminated compatibility with IE8 and lower versions. This means that older browsers only support versions of IE9 and later and other newer browsers, which should be avoided because they cause errors or malfunctions.

```html
<!--[if gte IE 9]><!-->
<script src="js/iscroll.min.js"></script>
<!--<![endif]-->

```

- In the case of scripts, they can be inserted at the top of the document as well as at any desired location.
- For style sheets, it should be written inside the head to minimize the triggering of FOUC.
