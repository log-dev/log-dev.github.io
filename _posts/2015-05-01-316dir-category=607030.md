### CITE Elements

The cite element is an element that is overridden in HTML5, indicating the cited title of the work.

```html
<p>This article is based on <cite>UX DESIGN</cite>.</p>

```

- Books, papers, essays, songs, movies, games, etc. correspond to works, and use the cite element when there are contents that introduce other people`s works.
- The cite element is a standard technique for citation, but it can also be used to display the title of the work, whether or not it is cited.
- The cite element cites a title about a reference or source, and the q element cites a reference or source.
- The cite element is an inline element, and most browsers display italic characters marked up with the cite element.
- The cite element must cite external content.

### Q Element

The q element indicates the quoted content.

```html
Chul-soo said, "Q life is beautiful."</p>

```

- If quoted, it can be used regardless of whether it is internal or external.
- It is an inline element, with most browsers represented in italics and double quotes.

### ABBR Element

The abbr element indicates an abbreviation (ABBReviation) or an acronym (acronym).

```html
<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>

```

- In HTML5, just as the acronym element disappeared, complex and subtle linguistic issues are considered to be better addressed in the writing area than in the markup language. In order to describe WWW, it is not necessary to use html specifications such as abbr elements, but to describe it as World Wide Web (WWW) in the writing area.
- An abbreviation or acronym description may use the title property, but it is also valid to be written at source in the writing area because it may not be output.

### SUB element

The sub element displays the subscripts below.

```html
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

```

H2O

- A subscript consists of letters or symbols and is sized and positioned according to special rules.

### SUP Element

The sup element displays the above subscript (SUPerscript).

```html
<var>E</var>=<var>m</var><var>C</var><sup>2</sup>

```

- A subscript consists of letters or symbols and is sized and positioned according to special rules.

### DEL Element

The del element displays the deleted text.

```html
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>!</p>

```

My favorite color is blue red!

- While most documents are provided as final, content that is important for revision, such as rules and guidelines, can be configured to compare and evaluate the content before and after a change, using the del element.
- Because deletion is important information, most browsers represent characters with del elements as cancellation lines.

Use the cite attribute to specify the document that describes the reason for deletion. In some cases, it is necessary to inform the reason for the change in detail.

```html
<del cite="http://www.example.com/promotion.html/" datetime="2014-01-20T20:00:00">워크숍 개최</del>

```

As a newly added property to HTML5, the datetime property specifies the date and time information at the time of change.

- YYYY: Year
- MM : Month
- DD : Date
- T : Separator
- hh : poem
- mm : minutes
- ss : seconds
- TZD : Time Zone Designer, calculated time difference based on Greenwich Mean Time Zone

### INS Elements

The ins element displays the inserted (additional) character (INSerted text).

```html
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>!</p>

```

My favorite color is blue red!

- It is used to add and inform the contents differently from the previous contents.
- Used in pairs with del elements, most browsers are represented in underlined letters.
- Like the del element, it has cite and datetime properties.

### S Element

The s element is an overridden element in HTML5, which is used to inform that it is no longer accurate or appropriate.

```html
<p><s>My car is blue.</s></p>
<p>My new car is silver.</p>

```

My car is blue.

My new car is silver.

- Express the characters with the element s applied as cancellation lines.

### ADDRESS ELEMENTS

The address element is an overridden element in HTML5, which displays contact information about the author or document.

```html
<address>
Written by <a href="mailto:webmaster@example.com">Jon Doe</a>.<br>
Visit us at:<br>
Example.com<br>
Box 564, Disneyland<br>
USA
</address>

```

- Lists the author, provider, contactable email address, company address, phone number, etc. of the document.
- It can only be used for contact information related to the current document.
- When used in a particular section, it is limited to a particular section, and when used in putter, it is contact information for the entire document.
- Unlike before, multiple contacts have been changed to fit in a single document so that each address can be held.
- It cannot contain block-level elements and can only contain inline elements and text.
- Most browsers display text marked up with address elements in italics, while separating it from other information through line spacing or line breaks.

This contact information can be marked up to be microformatted, RDFa, microdata, etc.

### SMALL Element

The small element was overridden entirely, meaning "a small letter area containing the definition of rights, guidance to procedures, legal restrictions, or copyright content". It is also used as a description of the property or a description of the license fulfillment." The reason why it is expressed smaller than the basic size of characters is to reveal that it is not the main content but an annotation.

```html
<p>W3Schools.com - the world's largest web development site.</p>
<p><small>Copyright 1999-2050 by Refsnes Data</small></p>

```

- When expressing content that doesn`t need to be read in detail, such as copyright, or that can be read without having to.
- When you are passive in expressing content that you don`t want to reveal, such as regulations,
- When expressing content that is not as important as a comment, but that helps you understand the body content.

### TIME Element

The time element is a newly added element in HTML5, indicating the date, time-zone offset, and duration.

```html
'<p>We open every morning from <time> 10:00</time>.</p>
>I have a date with her on <time datetime="2014-02-14">Valentine's Day</time>.</p>

```

As a newly added property to HTML5, the datetime property specifies the date and time information at the time of change.

- YYYY: Year
- MM : Month
- DD : Date
- T : Separator
- hh : poem
- mm : minutes
- ss : seconds
- TZD : Time Zone Designer, calculated time difference based on Greenwich Mean Time Zone

### WBR Element

The wbr element is a newly added element in HTML5, indicating Word BReak. If a long word comes to the end of a line, the browser cannot show it by breaking the word at will, so the whole word moves on to the next line, inevitably creating space at the end of the line. In this case, wbr elements can be used to show words by breaking them apart, and unlike br elements, they are not forced to change lines, but only when words come to the end of a line and show them by breaking words.

```html
<p>To learn AJAX, you must be familiar with the XML<wbr>Http<wbr>Request Object.</p>

```

### SPAN Element

The span element displays the inline SPAN. This element is a universal text container for grouping text, displaying the starting and ending points of the text, which binds the inline text.

```html
Her eyes were deep span style="color:blue"blue".</p>

```

### BDO Elements

The bdo element indicates whether it is a bi-directional override. This element is used to arbitrarily change the direction of text. Text direction is conventionally determined.

```html
<bdo dir="rtl">This text will go right-to-left.</bdo>

```

The dir property is a property that specifies the text direction. Text can proceed in two directions.

- `dir="ltr" : expresses text from left to right.
- `dir="rtl" : Express text from right to left.

### BDI Element

The bdi element indicates whether it is bi-directional isolation. Text with this element applied may have a different orientation from surrounding text. If the author knows the text direction, he/she can set the text direction with the bdo element and dir attribute, but if he/she does not know at all, the author cannot set the text direction arbitrarily.

```html
<ul>
<li>User <bdi>hrefs</bdi>: 60 points</li>
<li>User <bdi>jdoe</bdi>: 80 points</li>
<li>User <bdi>إيان</bdi>: 90 points</li>
</ul>

```

### RUBY Element

The ruby element is a newly added element in HTML5, which displays the reference text of the Ruby annotation. Ruby is a writing that is attached next to Chinese characters, and annotations are intended to easily interpret words. Ruby annotations require ruby and rt elements, which represent reference text that requires annotations, and rt elements represent ruby text that is provided as annotations.

```html
<ruby>
漢<rp>(</rp> <rt>한</rt> <rp>)</rp> 子<rp>(</rp> <rt>자</rt> <rp>)</rp>
</ruby>

```

- Used to indicate the pronunciation of Chinese characters, Japanese, etc.
- a word originated in the British publishing culture that uses 5.5pt of small writing to add a quote.

### RT Element

The rt element is a newly added element in HTML5, which displays RUBY Text. Ruby text refers to the letters provided as annotations and is mainly used to describe or sound reference text.

### RP Element

The rp element displays Ruby Parenthesis. This element is used to represent annotations in parentheses when the browser does not support rt elements.

### BR Element

The br element displays line BReak.

- The br element is used to lightly change the read flow through line breaks within paragraphs.
- It is often used when a reading start point begins in a new line, such as a poem.
- The p element should be used to give semantic distinction because it provides visual distinction only.
- To prevent the user and the interface from being divided into different lines, such as user interface, use a blank character between two words.
