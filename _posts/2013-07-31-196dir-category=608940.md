Ubuntu has a different structure than typical Linux distributions. I think it`s a characteristic of the Debian family.

### Setup directory structure

The setup file root location, where setup files are located under this directory.

It is a basic setup file and other distributions are using `httpd.conf` as a basic setup file, but Ubuntu uses `apache2.conf`.

It is a high-level setup file, and other distributions separately set up `httpd.conf` files, error messages, and security-related settings under the `conf.d` directory. The setup files for the Apache-related applications that the user will install will also be located.

This is an apache2ctl configuration file.

A user-specific setup file, historically httpd.conf was the default setup file, but now it is empty. Users can assign specific settings to use them.

The magic number database for the file. This value determines the MIME type of the file being transferred. Do not modify as much as possible.

This is where the available Apache modules are loaded.

The modules in /etc/apache2/mods-available above are added as symbolic links to make them work.

The Apache server`s service port settings allow you to set the default value of 80 for http, 443 for https, and ports for virtual hosts.

This is the setup file of the site to be operated by the server.

The files set in /etc/apache2/sites-available above are added as symbolic links to be used for actual operations.

### Default Settings

The default setting for apache2 is virtual host friendly. By default, if one virtual host is set up by the VirtualHost indicator and you plan to operate only one site, this virtual host setting becomes the default website.

You can modify and use the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file.

If you modify ServerAdmin`s mail address as desired and do not set it up on several other virtual hosts, it is used as the primary mail address.

ServerName is not specified. This will respond to all requests that do not match ServerName on other virtual hosts. If you do not wish to do so, add the domain you purchased to ServerName.

Server Alias is not specified by default, but www is often used as the host name, so you can add it.

The DocumentRoot value is specified as /var/wwww, which can be modified if desired.

Indexes are set in the Option item in the £Directory branch office, which can be removed to prevent the file list from being printed.

<Directory /home/MyID/www/uzuro.com>

Option -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews

First, copy the default file and change it to the desired file name (site name). Create a directory for a new site and set the path to DocumentRoot for the copied file.

Use the a2ensite utility to add.

```bash
sudo a2ensite mynewsite
sudo service apache2 restart

```

By default, index.html, index.cgi, index.pl, index.php, index.xhtml, index.xhtml, index.htm is set when /etc/apache2/mods-available/dir.conf is enabled. You can add more if necessary.

If the above files are not in the requested directory, the files will be listed if Indexes is set to the Option value of the > indicator.

It can be set in /etc/apache2/conf.d/localized-error-pages.

Apache`s default log files exist as access.log, error.log, and other_vhosts_access.log in the /var/log/apache2/ directory. If the errorLog indicator or CustomLog is not set separately in the virtual host settings, the logs are stored in the above mentioned files and created in the other_vhosts_access.log file if the settings are annotated or deleted by the virtual host.

If you plan to run multiple sites, you can create logs directories in each home directory and use many methods to locate them.

An error message will appear whenever the service is restarted, but the default site`s ServerName does not exist. This can be added to /etc/apache2/apach2.conf, such as ServerName localhost.

Ubuntu is basically compiled to dynamically recall modules. It can be surrounded by blocks of < to give instructions to specific modules and can be used by registering with /etc/apache2/mods-enabled.

Modules that do not exist in the /etc/apache2/mods-available directory are installed with an apt-get light.

```bash
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo service apache2 restart

```

Modules that are not to be used are used like `sudo a2dismod ssl` and restart apache services.

Create a structure of /home/UserID/public_html (notice that the folder owner is the user ID of the account).

```bash
mkdir public_html

```

User Directory Module Activation

Users will be able to access the http://Server Domain (IP)/~UserID.

```bash
sudo a2enmod userdir.conf
sudo a2enmod userdir.load
sudo service apache2 restart

```

Change settings in `sudovi /etc/apache2/mods-available/userdir.conf` accordingly

activating in the module user directory of php

The default settings for php modules are disabled by default on /home/*/public_html.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/apache2/mod-available/php5.conf

```

Annotate the block from the part of 끝나는 to the end of £IfModule_userdir.c.

The mod_ssl module adds an important feature to the Apache2 server - the ability to encrypt communications. Thus, when your browser is communicating using SSL, the https:// prefix is used at the beginning of the Uniform Resource Locator (U

The mod_ssl module is available in apache2-common package. Execute the following command from a terminal prompt to enable the mod_sslmodule:

There is a default HTTPS configuration file in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl. In order for Apache2 to provide HTTPS, a certificateand key file are also needed. The default HTTPS configuration will use a certificate and key generated by They are good for testing, but the auto-generated certificate and key should be replaced by a certificate specific to the site or server. For information on generating a key and obtaining a certificate see Certificates

To configure Apache2 for HTTPS, enter the following:

With Apache2 now configured for HTTPS, restart the service to enable the new settings:

You can access the secure server pages by typing https://your_hostname/url/ in your browser address bar.
