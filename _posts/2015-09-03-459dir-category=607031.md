I didn`t notice it because I didn`t usually do SNS, but the animation effect of the fave button on Twitter was unique, so I searched for it. I found a well-organized place and translated it.

> The step timing function is being translated into the step timing function, but the step timing function may be more correct in the context.

### Introducing Twitter fave

Twitter updated the design of fave (known as favorite) by applying a new animation effect. The focus is on animation effects using collections of images rather than CSS transitions. Let`s find out how to recreate animation using CSS animation `steps` timing function below.

### Illusion of motion

The illustration is similar to the live-moving Zoetrope effect. It has a similar effect by listing images on the plane inside the element.

### Demo

The animation starts when you mouse over the star shape.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="153" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/uzugoer/embed/XmWVgK?height=153&amp;theme-id=17120&amp;slug-hash=XmWVgK&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=uzugoer&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_XmWVgK"></iframe>

In this example, we create an animation, starting with creating a collection of images. In this case, we use an image set for animation of Twitter`s fave icon.

To implement these frame animations, images must be placed on a single line.

By downloading the above file, you can obtain an image listed in a single line. By placing this image as the background of the element, the transition effect can be obtained from the first frame to the last frame.

### step() timing function

Most timing features are like the "ease" or "cubic-bezier", a transition animation that smoothes between the start and end points. Timing function of `steps` is different from this. Instead of a smooth transition effect, the transition is divided into multiple steps, moving rapidly between each step.

The HTML settings are as follows (no problem with any of the elements you want).

```html
<section class="fave"></section>

```

### Background Image

Let`s add some styles to place the background image.

```css
.fave {
width: 70px;
height: 50px;
background: url(images/twitter_fave.png) no-repeat;
background-position: 0 0;
}

```

It is going to add `hover` status that will move the location of background to the end of image collection.

```css
.fave:hover {
background-position: -3519px 0;
transition: background 1s steps(55);
}

```

Pay attention to the `transition` declaration. In this case, it is set to transition background properties for 2 seconds using `steps` timing function. Because animation is 55 frames, 55 values are given for `steps` part.

This effect means that when the mouse is raised over an element, it is transmitted and moved over 55 steps.

### Why didn't you use gif?

Animated GIFs can potentially be used, but they are not suitable in this case. The use of animated GIFs typically results in larger files and difficulty controlling frame rates. Animation using CSS can be paused, rewinded, or other settings for animation can be set in any part.
