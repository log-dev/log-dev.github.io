WordPress 4.3 is named "Billy" in honor of jazz singer Billie Holiday, and is available for updates through dashboards (notifications) or for direct download. The new features of 4.3 make it easier to write content and modify the site to suit your taste.

### Menus in the Customizer (menu customization tool)

A user-defined tool provides real-time previews of everything that creates, changes, or assigns menus. Simplified user-defined tool design provides a mobile-friendly approach environment. It makes it easier and faster to create sites in any distribution in any way you want.

### Formatting Shortcuts

WordPress 4.3 provided a new format shortcut, which accelerated the flow of writing. Use * and # to speed up your writing.

> It provides something similar to MarkDown or Wiki grammar.

### Site Icons (site icon)

It displays a site icon (often called a Pavicon) on the browser tab, the bookmark menu, and the home screen of a mobile device. Adding a unique site icon from a custom tool keeps the theme well even if you change. The entire site reflects the brand.

### Better Passwords

An improved approach to cryptography allows the site to remain more secure. Instead of receiving the password via email, it was changed to obtain a password reset link. When adding a new user or editing a user profile, WordPress automatically generates a secure password.

### Other improvements

- Flexible management experience: WordPress, which is subdivided into manager list views, is more accessible and easy to work with on any device.
- Turning off comments on pages: Turning off comments on all new pages has become possible.
- Rapid site customization: To quickly change the site anywhere on the front end, you can click the customization link on the toolbar.
