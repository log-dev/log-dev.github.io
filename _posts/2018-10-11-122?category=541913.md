Font Unit (Font unit size comparison)

In css, various units such as pt, px, em, ex, and % can be used for font size or width, height, etc.

While most front development uses px units, em and % units are being used due to the current trend of reactive (RWD) and mobile devices.

While pt and px represent absolute sizes, em, ex, and % represent relative sizes for the parent element.

The advantages of em, ex, and % are the ability to adjust the font size in the menu of a web browser, which improves accessibility because the layout can be changed fluidly.

In other words, even those who cannot see small letters can easily see them by enlarging them.

Then let`s find out about the Font Unit used on the web.

### em

Em is a unit of relative size that allows you to set character size units that are low on the element.

Originally, the unit em originally means the width of the letter "M" in the alphabetical capital letters of the font set.

Typically translated into 1em = 16px in a web browser, 1em is the default for font sizes that are displayed when no letter size is specified in a web browser.

Em units allow scaling based on the letter size specified in the parent element.

Therefore, specifying 1.5em results in 1.5 times the letter size of the parent element (E.g. html,body).

It is commonly used to make the document layout flexible depending on the letter size.

### rem

The newly introduced rem as the font size value of CSS3 means rootem, which refers to the root element of an HTML document called the "html" element, which has a relative value based on the size specified in the element.

The em unit inherits the font size from the parent, but the rem unit inherits the font size from the root = html rather than the parent.

For example, because the em unit inherits font size from its parents, the font size becomes exponentially larger or smaller as the node deepens, even if the same value is set.

The problem with this approach is that changing the font size value of any element of a parent or ancestor node also affects all children and offspring.

Therefore, it is difficult to predict and complex to calculate. This complexity, of course, does not make this method a good use, although it exists with the aim of making font zoom flexible.

> html = 100% = 16px
body = 0.5em = 8px
div = 0.5em = 4px
p = 0.5em = 2px

However, because the "rem" unit inherits the font size from the progenitor rather than the parent, if the html element is given the default font size, it always inherits the font size from the HTML element.

The fact that changing the font size of an html element alone is no different from the em element itself, but the rem element does not inherit from the parent element, making it much easier to predict and calculate all font size changes on the page.

a useful situation

If you need to control the default font size differently depending on the resolution of your device, using rem units with media queries is effective.

Make font size reactive

### Basic em usage and calculation

html, body { font-size: 14px; }

14px 1em on this basis is 14px, so 20/14 1.43em when converting a font size of 20px to em

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="523" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/MLYbMW?height=523&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;default-tab=html&amp;user=jaehee&amp;slug-hash=MLYbMW&amp;pen-title=Example%20em%20unit&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="Example em unit" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_MLYbMW"></iframe>

### EM Vs REM

```undefined
<div class="container">

<p class="first">First Paragraph using EM's</p>

<p class="second">Second Paragraph using REM's</p>

</div>

<style>
html { font-size: 62.5%; }
body { font-size: 14px; font-size: 1.4rem; }
h1 { font-size: 24px; font-size: 2.4rem; }
</style>
```

> * units of rem are not inherited from parents. It is an abbreviation of rootem.

```css
html { font-size: 16px; }

/* 16 * 1.4 = 22.4 */
.container { font-size: 1.4em; }

/* em inheritance value 16 * 1.4 * 1.4 */
p.first { font-size: 1.4em; }

/* rem absolute value 16 * 1.4 = 22.4 */
p.second { font-size: 1.4rem; }
```

### px

px stands for pixel.

The px unit is recommended when elements need to be placed exactly in line with the image.

This is because the size unit of the image is px.

### pt

pt stands for point.

1pt is 1/72in.

### pc

pc means pika.

1 pc is 12pt and 1/6in.

### cm

cm means the logical centimeter of a screen.

One in is 2.54 cm.
