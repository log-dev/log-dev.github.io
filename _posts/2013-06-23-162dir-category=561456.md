A long time ago, without DNS, /etc/hosts files on all servers were required to directly register domain and IP address pairs in the following format to find IP addresses for the domain. This was a hard work that had to be modified each file every time, so now it is used to build and use DNS servers using bind.

```bash
cat /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

```

Generally, it is set as follows.

IP (tab) Hostname (tab) Alias

192.168.0.1 www.uzuro.com uzuro

192.168.0.2 ftp.uzuro.com ftp

When operating a DNS server, it reads the /etc/hosts file first by default. If the requested domain is registered here, it does not send DNS requests to the name server and connects to the address registered there. As a trick, the desired IP and domain name can be registered and used.

Windows has hosts files in C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc. Most of the time, I will use Windows as my main operating system, but I think it would be good to modify this file and register it with home, webhard, study, etc.
