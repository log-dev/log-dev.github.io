# Device Pixel Density

Let`s learn about pixel density by device, which is closely related to reactive web design including mobile.

You need to know how each device handles pixels in today`s rapidly diversifying environment—in an era of numerous devices—and how to respond.

### Pixel Density

Pixel density is the physical number of pixels in space (mostly used in inches).
(We use centimeters or millimeters in Korea, but we use inches overseas.)

The first Macintosh computer (Apple2) from a Xerox study was 72 pixels per inch.

When a pixel-based GUI is first introduced, it refers to an interface that is displayed as a graphic icon, which is easy for people to recognize.
So, if you look at the original Mac icon design, it was a pixel-based icon design like below, and this was the beginning of grilled (read by this pronunciation overseas).

### Device pixel density (Device Pixel Dentify)

Devices are physical machines, such as smartphones, desktops, laptops, and so on.

The density of pixels varies from device to device, starting with Apple`s 2010 display.

After Apple introduced its incredibly clear Retina display in 2010 by doubling the pixel per inch, it was faced with the need to consider the device`s pixel in graphic design and design.

This continued to grow to x3 (three times) and x4 (four times) after the Retina Display announcement, which also complicated the visual (including CSS) design process.

In the past, it was designed only in 1 ratio without considering multiples, but since 2010, pixel concentrations have changed significantly, so the views shown on Android devices, Apple devices, laptops, and desktop views all have different pixel ratios.

Therefore, the pixel of the device must be considered during the design process.

Earlier, density (concentration) was mentioned as the number of pixels in an inch of physical space, and for smartphones with small non-laptop devices, the number of pixels has been increased so that users can see the screen cleaner and clearer.

Therefore, it means that the number of pixels with 1x has doubled in width and length respectively. And what we`re talking about here is that the number of pixels has changed from one to four.

In other words, the total number of pixels has increased by 4 times (double the width and double the length), but the physical space size remains the same, and the number of pixels in the physical 1 inch space has been divided into 4 pixels, but it is said to be 2 times.(Refer to the following figure)

[Pixel Density: Number of pixels in 1 inch physical space]

This resulted in more detailed pixels of the mesh, and clear graphics on the Retina display were shown less clearly on the Non-Retina Display.

For these reasons, pixel density is critical in the design (visual and design) process, and for the manufacturer, graphics production needs to be worked more clearly to respond to displays that are growing at 3x and 4x.

For bit-bap graphics, vector graphics, which are affected by device pixel density, the bitmap graphics are less clear, but the vector graphics are less clear at all. You need to be familiar with this and make graphics suitable for devices that support high resolution.

It is important to remember that these influences on device pixel density require careful graphical production for jpg, png, and gif bitmap data, and that SVG or CSS of vector graphics are not affected by device pixel density.

In summary, for bitmac data, x2, x3, xn... to make it clear on the Retina display. I need an image of something.
We need an appropriate CSS response strategy.
Please refer to the Apple site for information on how to respond to CSS and how to make graphics.

However, if it is made graphically with SVG that is not affected by pixel density, we will not need to worry about how to respond to CSS because we will only consider scale 1.

Even now, most visual designers argue that the design should be doubled or tripled.
In Korea, we still consider Retina when posting this article, and we design it as 640, 750 and deliver it to CSS developers.
In fact, if visual designers work on a one-fold basis and pass on the graphics where bitmap data is used separately, not only collaboration between workers but also the UI provided to users can be upgraded.

### UI Size by Device

As I have mentioned above, I will take a more practical approach and point out how to size the UI according to each device.

Even if users` smartphones each have twice and three times the density of pixels, the physical size of the smartphone itself does not double or triple.

That is, the screen size of the physical space is the same regardless of the number of times two or three.

For example, let`s say we`re making a draft.
Despite the same physical space size, nine times the thermal draft works in twice and three times the draft.

Therefore, it is necessary to think about how to produce the UI size at double, triple, and quadruple.

In other words, to maintain the same physical UI size, the 44px size button must be 88px when the pixel area is x2x.
To apply this concept of UI to different devices, designers need to build the original x1 (one-fold) size as well as the x2 size.

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/99FB274B5C46C59823)

If the button is designed with a height of 44px and a multiples of that button, the high resolution display requires design work with a height of 88px.

Then how should designers work?!
Like I said, x1, x2... Do we have to make all the UI sizes according to?

If you make the design with 1X UI, it will break because it`s a bitmap.

Therefore, we use the method to double the number and divide by 2 to send out the results.

Then you can handle it so that it doesn`t break.

However, the problem here is that when dividing, the design should be made so that the integer comes out, but the decimal point comes out.

If the button is 89px high, 44.5px and other multiple-considered resulting UI sizes are treated as decimal points such as .7, .4, .2, the browser will have a problem with the spacing because each manufacturer has a different way of dealing with pixel units.

In order not to cause this problem, the result of the integer must be given.

So if we let the integer value come out in a split-two way, will everything be solved? It`s not like that at all.

It is because there is not only a double retina display.

Displays such as Retina HD and Quadretina (three times, four times...) also face challenges in how to respond.

If you want to divide into 2 and 3 and fall into integers, you need to get 0 even if you divide into 2 and 0 even if you divide into 3.
That means you have to work on six times the design work.
But I think everyone will know that it`s not the right way in general and common sense.

Working with double and triple times, the way domestic working designers do now, is that there is a problem with the fundamental design from the beginning.

The only way to solve this problem is to work with the draft as a 1x and pass on the device pixel density-impacted bitmap image by multiples-using the SmartObject type to preserve the original data, i.e. using the original SmartObject, which can responding to 2x, 3x, and 4x.

Understanding your mobile (app) application (native) environment

Perhaps some designer who is watching this post might ask this question by now.
"If you design it with double or triple, it doesn`t go down to the whole number."

The designers who ask the above questions are probably the ones who made designs for native people.

So if what I`ve posted so far was about the environment on the web (including mobile web and hybrid web apps), I`d like to talk about the native environment in the following article.

When considering various multiples, Apple recognizes problems that do not fall to integers and suggests the following methods:

As no independent unit of numerical measurement specifies pixel density, the design process becomes difficult, and as a solution, Apple presents Point(pt) units (which is distinct from Web UI.

In the past, `pt` units were used for printing, but Apple announced that it would be used as a device independent unit.

Therefore, if you look at the unit of points, the density of the screen is interpreted as `1pt = 1px` if the density of the screen is multiplied by `1pt = 2px` if you work with 1pt on the Retina display.

Literally means device independent. Then the producer doesn`t have to think about whether it`s 1px or 2px, but only needs to use 1pt.

In the previous comment, if the button had to be made from 1x to 44px, 2x to 88px, you can just work with 44pt.

This means that whether it is 4x, 5x, or 6x, it is used independently of the device, so there is no need to respond according to the density of each device.

However, this environment focuses on the environment of mobile (app) applications, especially IOS, rather than on the Web.

Therefore, if the height of the button is made to `44pt`, it is a unit independent of the device, so it is changed from 44px in 1 multiple to 88px in 2 multiple, so both graphics in the physical space appear clear.
Once again, the physical space size is the same, so the visible size is the same and the density is different.

Therefore, design makers don`t have to respond to various pixel densities and can design without any concern by using device-independent units.

To summarize by looking at the picture above, the pixel concentration was 44 pixels outside of the Retina display, so if it was done like this, you would have to work with 88 pixels in the Retina display environment and see how clear it is through the picture shows.
Furthermore, device-independent units can be used to respond to pixel densities above Retina levels.

What about Android?

Unlike Apple, the Android camp creates DP, a device-independent pixel density (DIP) unit.

And the problem is that it is different from Apple with an integer array, so it has a real array.

It`s much more complicated than Apple, and Android developers say they`re tired enough to use the numerical conversion tool for Android.

I don`t cover the native field, so I can`t go into more detail.

It`s not an app, but Android is bothering both designers and developers.

However, I hope that your understanding of the device pixel density mentioned above has solved many questions.

### Export Device Pixel Density UI Graphics (Start Point of Design)

Finally, what should we do when exporting UI graphics that correspond to device pixel density?

Remember that non-application webs are more important to be seen in web browsers (including mobile webs) than operating systems, so in that respect, web browsers are only bitmaps that affect pixel density and most UI, except for bitmap images like photos, should be created using vectors and design scale x1.

Also, CSS usage and vector graphics are not broken, so please make them as vector as much as possible before using them.

When using bitmap, a smart object (advanced object) is available to Photoshop users, and if the project environment is considered to be x3 (multiplier), the bitmap`s graphics will need to be worked in 3x and applied to 1x draft.

This is because exporting a smart object made of three times smaller than twice or once will not break it.

If you are an application creator, you will need to work with vectors as much as possible and export vector data as multiple times when you `Export`.
