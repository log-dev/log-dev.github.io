Let`s find out what is frequently used in html and its characteristics.

# Set the primary language used in the documentation

You can use the `lang` property on the html root element to set the language used in the document.

```undefined
<html lang="ko">
```

The language code for this is to be set up by referring to ISO 639 (International Standard for Distinguishing Language Names worldwide).

- Korean - ko or Korea of Republic (KR)
- English - en
- Chinese - zh
- Japanese - ja

These properties can determine how the voice will be output by allowing you to read the above properties through the screen reader, a device for the disabled.

# Headings, Paragraphs, Lists, Links, img, 어휘 요소들..

Markups for structural design typically result in HTML Elements being written within the `body` tag, and the tags used in the body area are structures that represent web services.

# the main components

HTML tags include the following types:

| |
| |
| |
| |

| |
| |

## Headings – h1~h6

The first content you read is the title, consisting of the h element.

The heading tag is used for the main title of the document, and the higher the importance of the title, the lower the `hx` value.

In other words, the title, the title, the title, the title, the title, the title, the title of the title. You can configure to .

```undefined
"<h1>Privacy policy guidance</h1>
<h2>The items and methods of collecting personal information</h2>
<h3> collects personal information </h3>
```

## Paragraphs – p

Use to express a paragraph in a sentence, and if you need to use a new sentence, try to declare a new p-tag.

Often used with heading tags, the paragraph (p) element allows only the vocabulary content as a child element.

```undefined
<p>This site was created for personal purposes.</p>
Visitors to <p>Please leave a guest book.</p>
```

## Lists – ul(Unordered list), ol(Ordered list),dl(Description list)

A list refers to a list, which can be divided into a non-sequential list, a sequential list, and a definition (description) list.

- ul, ol : The non-sequential list is `ul`, and the sequential list uses the `ol` element.
ul,ol has a `li` (listed item) as a child.
- dl (definitive or descriptive list) : The descriptive list consists of the term `dt` (Definition Term), the term `ddd` (Definition Description), and the list of explanations `dl` (Description List), where dl has dt, dd.
In other words, the description, definition list is organized by grouping multiple pairs of defined terms and descriptions.

```undefined
<dl>
<dt>Noun</dt>
<dd>Words that represent the name of a thing</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Commercial medicine list</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cold medicine</li>
<li>Disinfectant</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ranking of real-time spikes</h3>
<ol>
<li>IU</li>
<li>Afterschool</li>
</ol>
```

## Links – a(Anchor) 및 경로(path), image map

Learn about link elements.

```undefined
<a href="#" target="_blank">페이스북</a>
```

a(anchor) - Hyperlink

Anchor elements are usually used to move links within a page or to move to another page. `anchor hypertext reference="url"`

You can use the href property on a element to set the link address and add content inside the element to show the user.

In addition, the hyperlink address uses the Uniform resource locators (URLs) to refer to the file.
The URL refers to the resource location path of a Web site and consists of the following:

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/991C743A5C1B26B111)

Absolute / relative path, root relative path.

There are three ways to enter a URL in a Web document.

- Absolute path
- Relative path
- root-relative path

![image](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/9927F5355C1B26EE2E)

Absolute path
Absolute path refers to finding resources using a URL address, regardless of the current HTML document.
Use with "http://domain.com/resource.html". (See image below)

Relative Path
Relative path refers to setting a relative location in the current HTML document.
Use with "../misc/extras.html". (See image below)

Root Relative Path
Root relative path refers to finding a target in the top root path of the area where the HTML document currently exists.
Use with "/images.html". (See image below)

## Images - img, figure, figcaption

Let`s learn about the image elements that are displayed on the screen and the figure elements that bind diagrams, charts, tables, and images with captions.

img

```undefined
<img src="smiley.gif" width="42" height="42" alt="Smiley face"> 
```

Use to represent foreground images and src(source) is to define where the resource is, meaningfully.

And `alt` is an alternative text for users (disabled people) who do not see the image on the screen or cannot see the image.
Writing a replacement (to represent) for the image, which is read by the screen reader.
Therefore, this alternative text should analyze the content of the image and describe the appropriate description.

This is essential for web accessibility, and if it is a meaningless image, it can be left blank, that is, blank.
Also, if the image link is broken, the value of the alt attribute is output on the screen, providing information on which image it was, so if you set the alt attribute well, you can set the alt attribute.
Even if you are not blind, you can get help.
And if the image is well represented, the `title` property can be used if the end user wants to provide the same content as the alternative text.
This title property is represented by a tooltip effect when mouse over.

However, you cannot omit the alt attribute itself.
Also, the image element can define the width, height property value, and the image width setting `weight` can set the image height.
This is also good for browser optimization because it helps you download images more quickly.

The image format used in Web documents uses JPG, GIF, PNG formats, and SVG formats for vector graphics files.

- JPG: A JPG image is a format that is highly compressed, designed to handle a variety of colors, and is often used for photography or complex graphics (such as gradients). However, unlike GIF and PNG, transparent pixels are not allowed.
- PNG : PNG is suitable for all types except photographs and animations, because for photographs, the same quality PNG file size is typically larger than JPG. However, unlike JPG, it can be transparent, so it is good to use it for icons, logos, diagrams, etc.
- GIF : GIF is not suitable for photography because it has a limited color of 256 colors, but it is a formet that can be applied to animations and is good for simple graphic animations. And it can be transparent, but it is less expressive than PNG pomet.
- SVG : SVG is a vector-based graphical format that can be zoomed in and out without loss of quality.
That`s why it`s perfect for today`s environment—a responsive web design that responds to a variety of screens.
The bitmap image appears blurry when it is scaled up. (Because it is a pixelated graphic)

figure, figcaption

It is used to enclose `figure` charts, charts, tables, images with captions, and is wrapped with figure elements to specify that they are image areas referenced in the document.
The `figcaption` is used to represent a summary (description) of the figure.

```undefined
<figure>
"img src="images/buyaty.jpg.jpg" alt="The scene where the male and female protagonists of the jtbc drama [Beauty Inside] are reunited."
<!-- figure caption -->
<figcaptions>Source: Capture the broadcast screen of the jtbc Beauty Inside</figcaptions>
</figure>
```

## Quotation syntax, creation reference elements (cite) and line break

Let`s learn about the use of quotes, the factors that indicate the source, and the line change.

Quotation syntax

Citation refers to the use of a writing using single quotes, double quotes, etc. as a method of investigating other people`s words or writings.
Typically, use double quotes for direct quotes and single quotes for indirect quotes. Quotes in HTML usually use short inline quotes and long quotes.
The Quote element `<q>` indicates that the surrounding text is a short inline quote.
This element is used for short quotes that do not require a paragraph break, and the `blockquote` element is used for long quotes.
And if you use line breaks for each line of writing, use line break called `<br>.
However, it is not right to use br several times because of the large space in the line and line in the design. Br is a line break, and it is desirable to treat design elements with CSS.

## Phrasing elements

Let`s find out about the elements used in the sentence.

In progressing visual and structural design, parts of the content are sometimes used to emphasize the importance of certain parts of the sentence or to distinguish them from other characters rather than emphasize, importance, or relevance.
The elements used in these lexical elements are as follows.

- `<strong>`: Used when a strong emphasis is used to emphasize importance, seriousness, and urgency
- "<em>: Emphasis (weak)
- `<b>` : Elements used for distinguishing between letters and other characters, regardless of importance or relevance
- <i>: elements used in technical terms, idioms, thoughts, etc. that are distinct from other letters;

In general, there may be a Semantic and Non-Semantic emphasis, which should be applied separately, but it is important for the manufacturer to identify the context and determine whether it is a semantic or expressive emphasis.

strong - Semantic Element

It is used to emphasize the importance, seriousness, and urgency of the content.
Significance can be used to further emphasize some of the letters in the title/caption, to warn or warn of severity, and to indicate that urgency should be viewed earlier than other parts of the document. Strong elements, like the `q` element, are superimposed and, if superimposed, have each dept as a hierarchical structure.

em - Semantic Element

The `em` element is used to emphasize a particular content of stress (empasis) to indicate a rather weak emphasis that changes the meaning of a sentence.

b - Non Semantic Element

The `b` element can be used simply to distinguish itself from other letters, or for key words, product names, etc. in document summaries.

It is recommended to use element b if it does not meet the following conditions:

- Subject uses h1 to h6 elements
- Emphasis uses em elements
- Mark importance as strong element
- Displayed or highlighted text uses the `mark` element

i - Non Semantic Element

The `i` element is also used to separate itself from other letters, but can be used to express technical terms, other languages (voice), and the thoughts of the character.
