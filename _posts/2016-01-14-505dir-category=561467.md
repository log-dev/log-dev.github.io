Microsoft (MS) has terminated regular security updates for Internet Explorer (IE) older versions as of January 13. We recommend updating your browser (IE11, Edge) or using another browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, for potential security vulnerabilities.

### What if you are using an IE support exit browser?

Support terminated browsers are no longer excluded from security updates, non-secure updates, free or paid support options, or online technical content updates. In other words, even if problems such as hacking and data leakage using security vulnerabilities are found while using the browsers continuously, no support will be available from MS.

In these days when the spread of ransomware is active, it is easy to think of the worst scenario in an environment where there is no place to manage and there is no place to measure what is installed with ActiveX like Korea. In the case of in-house intranet, there are many cases of using old browsers, which can be targeted enough.

### IE Support Exit Browser

Starting at 02:00 on January 13, 2016, the browser version below will support regular security updates.

- Internet Explorer 8
- Internet Explorer 9
- Internet Explorer 10

### To check the IE browser version

- Implement IE.
- Call the browser help menu with Shift+Alt+H shortcut.
- Select Internet Explorer information.
- Check the Internet Explorer version.

### IE Browser Update

If the operating system (OS) you use supports IE11, you can install it with an automatic update run (put it on the updatable list).

- Start menu > All Programs > Run Windows Update
- Alternatively, visit MS Update.

> The usage rate of old browsers is still quite high in Korea. Generally speaking of older browsers, versions IE8 and earlier were often referred to, but it is surprising that MS officially included IE10 and earlier.

MS has been striving to fight older browsers through automatic and forced updates, but it has often not been updated due to user conditions. In the field related to web development, it has been constantly criticized, and the share of browsers is also decreasing.

If Chrome and Firefox, not IE, were popular browsers in Korea, they would not have had such slow results in web development.
