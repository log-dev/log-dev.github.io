Pickpick has been using open-capture for free for a while and found it while searching for other capture programs as the program was converted to paid and restricted. It has a variety of functions and includes editing functions, so I`m satisfied and using it.

### Introduction to PicPick

It is a comprehensive graphical work tool for bloggers, web designers, programmers, and end users, providing a variety of capture functions and functions such as ruler, angulator, and color extraction. Of course, it`s freeware.

Windows provides Paint as a basic image program, but there are many inconveniences in using it because it provides only the minimal basic functions required for image editing. This leads to the installation and use of an image editing program, which supports too many features that are not even used, or suffers from complicated usage.

PicPick offers a variety of capture and graphics-related add-ons, including all the basic features needed for image editing, and is highly recommended as a portable version because it does not write registry values or access system folders.

### Install PicPick

If you run the downloaded file from the homepage, the installation process is carried out without any process.

After the installation of PickPick, I reported that the "Capture Windows Control" shortcut overlaps with other programs. The Ctrl + PrintScreen key was duplicated, so it was changed to Ctrl + F12.

### How to Use PicPick

When PickPick is installed, an icon appears on the taskbar as shown below.

### PicPick licenses and FAQs

This is the content of the FAQ posted on the developer`s blog.

- Is it free for individual users only?
This is part of the license agreement for Pickpick Korean version.
2.1. The term "Korean version" means a specific version of "software" consisting only in Korean for distribution within South Korea.
2.2. The term "overseas license" means a license applicable to users of all countries other than the Republic of Korea and may be used only by the scope of use and the institution of use listed in the certificate.
2.3. This "Product" is only licensed free of charge if "Korean Version" is installed, and "User" must purchase "Overseas License" if it is desired to use "Product" in other countries. For overseas license licenses, please visit the official website at http://www.picpick.org/en/EULA).
In summary, the "PicPick Korean version" distributed by this blog is freeware for all users (including individuals, businesses, and public institutions) to install and use for free. Therefore, it is not subject to illegal software crackdown. On the other hand, PicPick, which is distributed by global sites, is freeware for personal use, which means that programs are subject to restriction...We`re not going to get caught.
- I searched on the Internet and found that it`s free only for individual users.
Prior to PickPick 3.1.0, there was no Korean-only version and it was integrated and distributed from the global site, so it was provided free of charge only to individual users. In other words, you can ignore the licenses that appear in the Internet search results or in the post before the blog because they are from the past.

Since the 3.1.0 version, which will be released after December 2011, only the Korean version has been excluded and distributed on the blog. Please go to the English website and don`t download it hard, and write a Korean version that doesn`t have a toolbar or change the start page (ㅜㅜ)
- Do you collect personal information?
Do not collect personal information. I send a web request to the server to check the version, but if you turn off the automatic update function, nothing will be released.
- About the future pay policy?
No plans. I`m not interested. Do you need further explanation?
- About the collision of shortcuts...?
To start with the conclusion, it`s the PC problem. Nine in a column is a problem caused by overlapping Print Screen keys, but another capture program is running. This may be caused by some DRM software designating the Print Screen key as HotKey first. First, examine the tray area of the taskbar to see if any of the programs are running, and examine the running process, the startup program (msconfig) registered in the registry, and the running service. I can`t explain any more. (ㅜㅜ)
