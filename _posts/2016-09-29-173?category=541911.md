Compass Expansion Pack

Compass is a framework used by Sass.

You can import and use predefined style modules such as CSS3, typography, grid, layout, etc.

· Create and use Spites images easily and quickly.
· The CSS3 mix-in provided by Compass makes writing code easier.
· We provide beautiful typography (in our country's reality...)£)

### Learn the Class command

If you type gem install pass in the command window, the pass will be installed (requires sudo if the Mac fails).

class -v can view the information and version of the installed compass.

The compass -h provides command help information for the compas -h

When you run the class init command, the config.rb (compas configuration file) is created for building compas in that directory folder, as well as the default sass, css default file, and sass-cashe file for caching sass.

Specify the pass create folder name => folder and do the same thing as the init command on that folder.

In other words, the above two commands create a Class project template.

You can check the version of the class module list.

Compass provides built-in file templates

When you run the class init or class create, unnecessary files are created in the template.

This option --bare, as it provides a basic template but is inconvenient, allows you to create only the sass folder and config.rb file.

### config.rb (set default configuration file)

Like sass watch, the compass also goes to the directory where the config.rb file is located in the command window, and then compiles it.

The short expression is pass w.

### bourbon

If @ compass is the framework, burbon is the library (for Mixin).

After downloading the compass mix code by running , you can only use the mix code that you want to use.
