The menu provided by Gnubod5 does not have a class set to tell you where it is. Take a quick look at how to add an active class that will be used to tell you where you are.

### Menu current positioning principle

The menu provided by Gnubod5 includes `$row[`me_link`]`, which contains the link address. If this is the same as the address in the address window of the current page, the corresponding menu `<li>`.Its key point is to set up `active` to be added. By adding a design for `.active` to a style sheet, regular menus and current location menus are distinguished.

Naturally, it only works with menus added in the Admin > Preferences > Menu Settings on Gnubod 5, and does not work if you use a different way of changing the address in the address window.

### Set Menu Current Location

The code for setting the menu`s current position and giving each menu a class to select is as follows.

```php
<ul id="gnb_1dul">
<?php
$sql = " select *
from {$g5['menu_table']}
where me_use = '1'
and length(me_code) = '2'
order by me_order, me_id ";
$result = sql_query($sql, false);
$gnb_zindex = 999; // gnb_1dli z-index 값 설정용
$cur_url = G5_URL.$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; // #1Add for current location settings

for ($i=0; $row=sql_fetch_array($result); $i++) {
$li_view1 = $i+1; // #2 Set to add each menu name
?>
<li class="gnb_1dli <?php echo 'gnb_1dli_'.$li_view1; ?> <?php echo ($row['me_link']==$cur_url)?'active':''; ?>" >
<a href="<?php echo $row['me_link']; ?>" target="_<?php echo $row['me_target']; ?>" class="gnb_1da"><?php echo $row['me_name'] ?></a>
<?php
$sql2 = " select *
from {$g5['menu_table']}
where me_use = '1'
and length(me_code) = '4'
and substring(me_code, 1, 2) = '{$row['me_code']}'
order by me_order, me_id ";
$result2 = sql_query($sql2);

for ($k=0; $row2=sql_fetch_array($result2); $k++) {
if($k == 0)
echo '<ul class="gnb_2dul">'.PHP_EOL;
$li_view2 = $k+1; // #3 Set to add each submenu name
?>
<li class="gnb_2dli <?php echo 'gnb_2dli_'.$li_view2; ?> <?php echo ($row2['me_link']==$cur_url)?'active':''; ?>"><a href="<?php echo $row2['me_link']; ?>" target="_<?php echo $row2['me_target']; ?>" class="gnb_2da"><?php echo $row2['me_name'] ?></a></li>
<?php
}

if($k > 0)
echo '</ul>'.PHP_EOL;
?>
</li>
<?php
}

if ($i == 0) { ?>
Preparing liid="gnb_empty" menu.<?php if ($is_admin) { ?> <br><a href="<?You can set it in phpecho G5_ADMIN_URL; ?>/menu_list.php">Administrator Mode > Preferences > Menu Settings.<?php } ?></li>
<?php } ?>
</ul>


```

- 15: The `style="z-index: <?php echo $gnb_zindex--; ?>"` should have been added, but it was deleted above due to a notation conflict with T-story. In practice, it should be added.

```php
'$cur_url = G5_URL.$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']; // #1Add for current location settings

```

- `G5_URL` is an absolute path constant set in Gnubod5. This returns the same path as the http://domain name.
- `$_SERVER[`REQUEST_URI`]` is a constant that returns the domain except for the address on the current page. Unlike other PHP constants that return only file names or directory names, this constant is suitable for use where parameters are needed, such as bulletin boards, because variable values are also passed along.

```php
$li_view1 = $i+1; // #2 Set to add each menu name

```

- This setting is for displaying the increased name by 1 for each `$row`.

```php
$li_view2 = $k+1; // #3 Set to add each submenu name

```

- This is the same as described above, which is the setting for menu names to be displayed in the submenu.

```php
<li class="gnb_1dli <?php echo 'gnb_1dli_'.$li_view1; ?> <?php echo ($row['me_link']==$cur_url)?'active':''; ?>" >

```

- `<?php echo `gnb_1dli_`.$li_view1; ?>` is inserted as the class attribute, starting with `gnb_1dli_1`, the class name in the following menu is the class name with the last increasing number in the format gnb_1dli_2, .gnb_1dli_3.
The class name (menu name) is not based on the order added to the manager`s menu setting, but on the order field of the menu setting. That is, the actual order displayed on the screen is the reference.
The addition of menu names to sub-menus is in the same format as above.
- The class name (menu name) is not based on the order added to the manager`s menu setting, but on the order field of the menu setting. That is, the actual order displayed on the screen is the reference.
- The addition of menu names to sub-menus is in the same format as above.
- `<?php echo ($row[`me_link`]==$cur_url)?`active`:`; ?>` is also inserted as a class attribute value, and `active` is inserted by comparing the current page address with the link address set in the menu setting.
Note that `$row2[`me_link`]` is used in the submenu section.
- Note that `$row2[`me_link`]` is used in the submenu section.
- As a result, if you look at the classes in the first menu, the common class gnb_1dli, the class gnb_1dli_1, which allows you to select the menu, and if the current location is a page in the first menu, the class active is inserted.

### Add Style Sheet

The style sheet for the area where the menu is inserted, most of which is default.css, requires the desired design to be added. Of course, the existing menu area should be deleted or modified to prevent overlapping designs.

For example, let`s say that we want to set the colors of each menu differently in rainbow colors.

```css
.gnb_1dli a {
/* Common settings */
display: block;
font-size: 14px;
font-weight: bold;
color: #fff;
}

.gnb_1dli_1 > a {
background-color: red;
}

.gnb_1dli_2 > a {
background-color: orange;
}
...

```

Let`s put a different design on the menu at the current location.

```css
.gnb_1dli a {
/* Common settings */
display: block;
color: black;
background-color: transparent;
}

.gnb_1dli.active > a {
color: #fff;
background-color: red;
}

.gnb_2dli.active > a {
color: #fff;
background-color: orange;
}

```

- If you have a sub-menu, you can also add a design for the sub-menu.

### Additions for Sub-Menu

In the case of a typical menu bar, the sub-menu is hidden and only the primary menu is shown. The submenu says.Although active` is applied, it is unknown unless actions such as mouse over or clicking occur, and may want to modify them. A simple method is to use JavaScript to make a parent menu of sub-menu.It is to add `active`.

```undefined
$(document).ready(function() {
// Menu active
if ($('.gnb_2dli').hasClass('active')){
var $hasActive = $('.gnb_2dli.active');
$hasActive.parents('.gnb_1dli').addClass('active');
};
});

```

- Use jQuery to simply `.Parents of sub-menus with `active` also have `.It added `active`.
