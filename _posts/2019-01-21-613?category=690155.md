# CSS Concepts

Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is a language that describes how the markup language is actually displayed, and is mainly used in HTML and XHTML, and is also available in XML.

In other words, if you use the link element in an HTML document to read a CSS file in the language that styles HTML documents (standard in W3C), the structure of the HTML document is styled through CSS.

## Why CSS?

- Allows you to separate the articulatory design from the explicit structural design.
- It can be easier to access from various devices.
- It`s easy to modify many revisions to the website more quickly (just one CSS file, not all pages).
Of course, CSS files are divided into content characteristics, but even if there are multiple pages, they have a common style (design), so if you just modify those CSS files, it`s easy to work with.
- It is also good for readability, performance optimization, and customizing designs to your liking for code.
- And for those who run the site, maintenance is good, which is easy to manage.

## Style Documentation Default Creation Method (Syntax of CSS)

```css
h1 {
color: blue;
font-size: 16px;
}
```

As shown in the above CSS code, CSS is a phrase consisting of a selector, the beginning, end of a declaration interval (a bracket called a code block), a property, a value, and a pair of attributes and values, called a declaration; (semicolon).

CSS Style Declaration Method

Learn three ways to style HTML documents using CSS.

Internal Style

```undefined
<html>
<head>
<style type="text/css">
h1 {
color: blue;
font-size: 16px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Embed Style Sheet</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

As shown above, it is called the inner style to write a style sheet inside the `head`.
By default, the inner style should only be used on the head and not on the inside of the inner style should be used only on the head.

Internal styles are usually used when the CSS portion of a single page is small.

Inline Style

```undefined
<h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">
Embed Style Sheet
</h1>
```

Writing CSS code using the style properties inside an element in a single line (line) as above is called inline style.
properties, used when values need to be changed dynamically

External Style

```undefined
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" type="text/css">
</head>
<body>
<h1>Embed Style Sheet</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

The most recommended and common way to manage CSS files separately.

## Preview: CSS Properties and Categorization

CSS has the following properties and is recommended to declare them in order of layout (batch) and associated properties:

| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |
| |

Consider attribute order when creating CSS

In terms of readability, we recommend that you write the above attributes from a large blur to a small flow.

There may be several large flows, but CSS is a visual representation, so it`s about whether the most important thing is to be seen or hidden.

So if any of the properties that need to be declared are `display`, we first define the `display` property and sequentially write the properties that are normally required for layout.

It is then common to write in a flow of attribute values (usually attributes that are a little far from the layout) for detailed control of multiple people.

In fact, we don`t always follow the order above, but it doesn`t matter if the order changes a little.

However, if these attributes are roughly observed within a large framework, not only for maintenance workers but also among collaborators, we can quickly predict where and what CSS attribute values are defined.

For this reason, keeping the properties in order can increase the readability of the code.

## CSS Selector

The CSS selector is provided with a choice of targets so that you can select and decorate elements (destinations) in the document.

Without a selector, there is no way to style, so you should have specified properties such as inline styles for each element.

You can style all of an element or a specific group, so you can style many elements with just a few lines of CSS, and it`s very useful in JavaScript as well as CSS, so you need to learn enough.

CSS offers a variety of selector options for selecting HTML elements, which can be categorized into three main categories:

- `ID Selector` : [#content, #footer] 구체성(0, 1, 0, 0)
- `Class Selector` : [.aside, .section] specificity (0, 0, 1, 0)
- `Type Selector` : [h1, div, span, em] 구체성(0, 0, 0, 1)

The ID Selector uses the shape of a well pavilion, which is a hash, a sharp.

The Class Selector is separated by a .(point) and uses a .(point) before the user-defined name.

The Type Selector is called an element (type, tag) selector and uses the element name as it is.

```css
#wrap { ... }
#wrap .header { ... }
.content div ul.noti li { ... }
```

There are three major choices as shown above, but there are other choices.
Let`s find out about these different choices.

### Group Selector

It is easy to tie various elements together through a comma and style them in batches.

```css
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {font-weight:normal;}
a, img, p {border: none;}
h3 span, h4 span {position:absolute; left:200px;}
```

### Universal (Full) Selector

*(Asterisk) The selector is called the entire selector and can be used to give all elements present in HTML a batch of styling.

```css
* {margin:0; padding:0;}
html body {text-decoration:none;}
p.info {text-transform:capitalize;}
```

### Multiclass Selector

Multiclass refers to the presence of multiple selectors as meaningful.
When using a multi-class, there should be no space between .(point) and .(point).

```css
p.note.info {width:300px;}
.box.list {outline:1px solid #333;}
.noti-list { position:absolute;}
```

This applies only if the p element has a class named note and info.

### Proposed (sub) selector

You can think of the family tree for the offspring selectors.

```css
p strong {font-weight:normal;}
ul li a {text-decoration:none;}
h2 span {position:relative; left:-20px; z-index:2;}
```

`pstrong {font-weight:normal;}` This code means that find the strong element inside the p and decorate the target.
Since they are Descendants, there may be many other elements between p and strong.

### Child selector

The Child Selector uses the > symbol, unlike the offspring selector.

```undefined

```

### Property Selector

The property selector uses square brackets to select a destination using the property name.

```css
/* <div id="anywayId"></div> */
div[id] { font-size:14px; color:#000; }

/* <p class="note"></p> */
p[class="note"] { position:absolute; left:100px; }

/* <img src="love.jpg" alt="love-you">
|(Pipe) Symbol finds target by separating -(Dash)
*/
img[alt|="love"] { border:2px solid blue; }

/* <a href="http://naver.com"></a> */
a[href^="http://"] { background-color: yellow;}

/* <a href="../part/display.psd"></a> */
a[href$=".psd"] { float:left; }

/* <a href="#;" target="_blank" title="htmlcssjavascript"></a> */
a[title*="css"] { display:block; }
```

### Adjacent sibling selectors and generic sibling combinator

The adjacent Sibling Combinator is targeted at siblings immediately following an element.

In addition, the general sibling combinator selector is similar to the neighborhood combinator, but unlike the neighbor selector who targets the sibling that comes directly after the element, this selector can target any sibling that follows the element.

## Pseudo class, Element

So far, if you`ve chosen a target for elements that exist, the following selectors will learn how to select virtual classes and elements that do not exist: There are two virtual concepts in CSS: virtual classes, virtual elements.

### Pseudo-class (virtual class)

Virtual classes are called pseudo-classes, pseudo-classes, and Pseudo-classes, which are characterized by : (colons) immediately following the selection.

The following virtual classes are supported by CSS 2.1:

- `:link` - links you haven`t visited, i.e. what you have by default (if you don`t have a history) are called links
- `:visited` - the link you`ve visited once, the state you`ve visited.
- `:hover` - mouse raised
- `:active` - Active elements (the moment you click the link with the mouse)
- `:focus` - element in focus state of focus
- `:first-child` The first child of the selected element

```css
a:link, a:visited { color:#999;}
a:hover, a:active { color:#333; }
p:hover { color:blue; }
input:focus { background-color:darkred; }

/* When the mouse goes up in focus... */
input:focus:hover { background:#000; }
```

`:hover`, `:active` is applicable to all elements, not just to the anchor element.

The above state design is also very important in terms of web accessibility.

KOREAN AIR(https://www.koreanair.com/global/en.html)

This Korean Air site is made worldwide, especially in countries where accessibility laws are very strict, such as the United States, you have to deal with whether the status is visible when you raise your mouse.

### Other Structural Virtual Classes

- `:first-child` : first child selected.
This means that it can be processed virtually without giving the actual class (.first-child).
- `:last-child`: refers to the last child.
- `:nth-child(n)` : nth target selected.
You can use numeric values, point to the corresponding target for the number, and you can apply a formula (formula).
This means that the nth child selector is more flexible than the first or last choice.
If you want to choose your fifth or eighth child, you can use :nth-child(n) to make your choice very easy.
(2n) is an even number and (2n-1) is an odd number. I`m trying to make it easier to use even and odd numbers like 2n and 2n-1.
CSS provides even number `ven` and odd number `odd`.
- `:lang(ko)` : It can provide different designs depending on the language used when the lang attribute is used on the HTML element.
For example, you can apply a different font when you have a Korean or English page.
- :empty : refers to a childless element.
- :not(x) : points to elements except x element.
- :only-child : refers to elements without siblings.
- :only-of-type : Select a sibling with a unique type.
- :nth-of-type(n) : element of the nth type is selected.
It should be noted that it refers to a type, as the name of the virtual class says.
In other words, type is called tag selector, but it can be confusing if you don`t understand what type means by tags.
- :nth-last-of-type(n) : points to the nth element calculated from behind the type
- :first-of-type : pointing to the first child element of a particular type.
- :last-of-type : pointing to the last child element of a particular type.

:last-child

What you have to remember here is that you have to be a child.

What is the difference between `:nth-of-type(n)` and `:nth-child(n)?

The most important difference is that if there is a difference with the example code `:nth-child(n), we filter only the type (tag).
This means that you choose the nth among the types (tags).

:first-of-type, :last-of-type example code

`:first-of-type`, `:last-of-type` This virtual selector is also used to select the first and last element of a particular type.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="560" width="100%" name="cp_embed_5" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/bZJgJm?height=560&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=bZJgJm&amp;default-tab=css%2Cresult&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_5" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_bZJgJm"></iframe>

:empty 와 :not(x)

`:empty` can be used to select content or childless elements and `:not(x)` can be used to select all elements except for x, where x means another selector.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="435" width="100%" name="cp_embed_6" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/grymaj?height=435&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=grymaj&amp;default-tab=css&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_6" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_grymaj"></iframe>

### Pseudo Element (virtual element)

Virtual elements are different from virtual classes.
A virtual class acts as if it were granted a class even though the user did not add a class to the document, and the virtual element has the same effect as when the element was directly marked up in the document.

If the virtual class used one colon (:), the virtual element uses two colons (::).
Until CSS 2.1, one colon was used, but from CSS3, two colons (::) are standard.
However, we still allow 1 colon due to sub-compatibility.

```css
.demo01::before {
content: "";
display: block;
height: 5px;
border: 1px solid red;
}
ul li:first-child {
color: blue;
}
```

Next is the CSS2.1 virtual element.

- `:::first-letter`: Find the first letter of the letter and style it.
- `::first-line`: Can dynamically style the first line.
- `::before` : Element is created as the first child using this virtual element.
- `::after`: Element created as the last child using this virtual element.

## CSS 상속(Inheritance)

Inheritance refers to the style declared on the parent node affecting even the child node.

In other words, the CSS style declared in `h1` will be inherited to the child node `span`.

And let`s look at some of the CSS attributes that are inherited, some of the attributes that are not inherited, some of the attributes that are inherited, and some of the attributes that are not.

Inherited Properties

If an element`s inherited property does not have a value specified, the element obtains the calculated value of the parent element`s property.
A typical example of an inherited property is the `color` property.

Color of letters, related to letter design.

- color
- font-size
- font-family
- letter-spacing

Uninherited Properties

A typical example of a non-inherited property is the `border` property.

Something about space-

- outline
- margin
- padding
- border

```undefined
<h1>CSS
<span>Inheritance</span>
</h1>
```

```css
h1 { /* type selector */
color: red;
}
```

![image](https://webclub.tistory.com/images/inheritance.png)

## CSS priority, cascading

When combining multiple CSS files, the process of resolving conflicts is Cascade.

There is a priority in CSS, which refers to the right to be applied first, which corresponds to the cascading rules of the CSS language.
For example, if the same property declaration is duplicated, the property declared later has high priority and the selector is applied.

```css
h1 {
color: red;
}
h1 {
color: blue;
}
```

## Specificity, specificity, and specificity of priorities

The CSS style is applied by the specificity of the weight defined in the W3CSS 2.1 specification.

Explicitness is a numerical representation of how explicit the selector is?

There are three criteria to determine the specificity of the selector.

The numbers above and commas are the criteria.

There is a comma between the numbers, which is independent of each level of granularity.

This is because having one class descriptor defined may be more explicit than having multiple element (type) selectors.

Also, if you don`t separate it with commas and convert it to 0013 score, you need to be careful because there is a misunderstanding that can be understood as 13 points.

If the specificity is 0,0,1,0 and 0,0,0,0 and 11 specifications are misunderstood as 10,11, so you can misunderstand that the specifications are higher.

```undefined
'<h2>Heading element
<span>Explicit Test (0,0,0,2)</span>
</h2>

£h4 class="c_type">class specifications are:
<span class="c_type2">0,0,2,2 입니다.</span>
</h4>
```

```css
h2 {
color: red; /* 0,0,0,1 */
}
h2 span {
color: green; /* 0,0,0,2 */
}
h4.c_type { /* 0,0,1,1 */
color: gray;
}
h4.c_type span.c_type2 { /* 0,0,2,2 */
color: pink;
}
#content {
color: black;
}

div ul ul li {
/* Element descriptor 0,0,0,4 */
}

div.aside ul li {
/* One class and three elements, so 0,0,1,3 */
}

a:hover {
/* One virtual class and one element 0,0,1,2 */
}

div.nav a:hover {
/* One virtual class, one class, and two elements, 0,0,2,2 */
}

#content em {
/* Since you have 1 ID selector and 1 element selector 0,1,0,1 */
}
div#content em {
/* 1 ID selector and 2 elements 0,1,0,2 */
}
```

In addition, the first zero in the explicit plot indicates an inline style.

## Definitely : !important

There is something that takes precedence over the specificity that has been explained so far.There is `important`.

In JavaScript, you may understand that `!(operator)` is not important because it is an operator that means negation, but it is not in CSS.

```undefined
<div id="demo">
<p id="demo-child" style="color:tan">Lorem ipsum dolor sit.</p>
</div>
```

```css
div#demo p#demo-child {
color: red /*!important*/; /* 0,2,0,2 */
}
div p {
color: green !important; /* 1,0,0,2 */
} 
```

By default, a declaration with a critical mark will override any declaration without a critical mark.

Although it is more specific because there are two ID selectors, the priority is `!Because it was lost to the `important`, the impotant acts as the joker of the card.

But both of them said, "!What if `important` is declared?

Because both declarations have Joker declared, they are on an equal level, so general cabling rules apply.

That is, the specifications apply.

Therefore, `!important` should be used carefully. If you start abusing it, you`ll almost end up in an impact black hole, which will lead to difficulties for maintenance and practitioners.

If possible, do not use it, but keep this in mind.
