function-based classes, prototype class

### Procedure-oriented approach code

### Object-oriented approach (classes based on functions)

### Object-oriented (classes in prototype)

So far, we`ve refactored the procedure-oriented method into two types of object-oriented methods.

This kind of question could happen. Maybe the object-oriented code is longer and less readable.

There will be a lot of people coding in a procedure-oriented way so far. Not long ago, I was also familiar with the function unit-based procedure orientation.

However, object orientation is much better in terms of maintenance and readability in that it allows module-specific management. It`s just that I`m not used to it.

The j-query code is also packed with prototype-based code. And when I run the code above, I have the console window check the performance time, and if I check it, the prototype-based classes perform much faster. The code is longer but faster.

When considering performance optimization and maintenance aspects, prototypes must be used. Of course, it`s not all about using prototypes, but for reusable code, it`s better to use prototypes at least if you`re going further with a function-based class.
