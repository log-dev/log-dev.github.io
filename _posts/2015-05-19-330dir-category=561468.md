### Introducing Selectivizr

Selectivizr is a JavaScript utility that emulates CSS3 virtual classes, allowing users to see styles applied to the elements in IE6–8. Simply encode the selectivizr script on that page and the rest is automatically processed.

Internet Explorer also added support for 19 CSS3 virtual classes, two virtual elements, and all attribute selectors. It also addresses several problems with native selectors in browsers.

This script is processed automatically, so it doesn`t matter if you don`t have JavaScript knowledge. You don`t even have to modify the style sheet. Only by describing the CSS3 selector will it work on IE, including the old version.

selectivizr requires a JavaScript library. If one of the seven supported libraries listed below is already applied to the website, simply add selectivizr. Otherwise, the JavaScript library must be inserted first.

### How to use Selectivizr

Insert the JavaScript library mentioned in the picture above into the head tag first.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="[JS library]"></script>

```

Let`s add conditional comments as below.

```html
<!--[if (gte IE 6)
```

This adds a `selectivizr.js` file and an alternative CSS file for IE6–8. Alternative CSS files are optional and will be hidden while visible in other browsers.

The caveat here is that links to CSS files must be listed first. To summarize again, the markup is as follows.

```html
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
<script type="text/javascript" src="[JS library]"></script>
<!--[if (gte IE 6)
```

### Some rules for using Selectivizr and limitations to be aware of.

- Selectivizr will automatically find the best JavaScript library for what it wants to do. If the library you are already using does not support the selectors you want to use, you must re-insert and apply the other of the seven supported libraries.
- Emulation is not dynamic. Changes to the DOM are not reflected when the style is applied. So they are fixed.
- The CSS definition must be done on an external style sheet and linked to a web document. Internal styles defined inside Web documents will not be analyzed.
- If JavaScript is not available, a fallback style sheet must be inserted. All you have to do is simply add it into the tag.
- The defined styles can be identified in the server environment of the same domain. In addition, it should be loaded as a file, not as a protocol, to work properly.
- Selectivizr requires Web documents to be in standard mode to function properly in IE. Therefore, the DTD declaration must be checked at the top of the document.
