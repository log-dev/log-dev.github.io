When you back up tokens used for authentication in Windows and Office, you can easily recover authentication by formatting your system. It`s convenient for those who frequently initialize the system, but it`s important to note that if the components of the system change, the tokens you`ve backed up will be useless.

### Advanced Tokens Manager V3.5 RC5

The Advanced Tokens Manager is a very useful tool for backing up Windows and Office authenticated tokens, later formatting hard disks, and restoring backed up tokens if Windows and Office are reinstalled. This method is useful for Microsoft to set a limit on the number of times online and phone authentication.

### Advanced Tokens Manager Instructions

- In order to authenticate OEMs, we need to prepare accurate SLICs.
- Online and telephone authentication are immediately authenticated after token restoration.
- Don`t change your PC`s primary hardware.
- Since Windows 8 and Office 2013 are the same authentication system, backups are stored together in "Activation Backup".
- Backup of Windows 8 and Office 2010 or Windows 7 and Office 2013 and Office 2010 are stored separately as "Windows Activation Backup" and "Office Activation Backup".
- Windows and Office 2013 installations are required to restore authentication on Windows 8 systems.

### When an error occurs that the product key does not match,

- If the program does not detect the correct product key in the registry, it must be entered manually.
- The product key is required to restore the correct token, and the product key is stored in the config.ini file.
- In the event of an error, the product key must be manually entered for proper restoration.
- It occurs mainly in MAK product keys hidden in the registry.
- It detects the last five characters of the actual product key.

### Backup Compatibility

Support for Windows 8.1 is not complete. All authentication data can be stored, but only phone-certified backup data will be restored. In other words, online-certified backups cannot be restored so far. I`m trying to explain the reason.
