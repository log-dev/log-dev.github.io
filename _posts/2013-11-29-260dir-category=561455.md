When you get Windows iso files that are floating on the Internet, you often have to distinguish between the original files distributed by Microsoft or the modified version by someone else`s hand. When deploying not only Windows, but also general utilities, the file`s hash value is often written down, which is also the basis for reading whether files floating on the web are genuine or not.

### Find out the Windows Genuine ISO Hash Value

Information about Windows ISO files can be found on Microsoft`s Technet or MSDN.

Technet: http://technet.microsoft.com/ko-kr/subscriptions/downloads

▼ Windows 8.1 is an example on the MSDN site.

▼ You can check the file name and SHA1 value at the bottom of the details, and if you google it, you will be able to get the related iso file. Leave it to the individual.
