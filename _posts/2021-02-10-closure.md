# What is a closure?

> Closure is a technique for binding variables bound to a scope using the concept of first-class functions. Functionally, a closure is a record that stores a function, and the arguments of the scope are defined when the closure is created, and access to it can be achieved through a closed, independent copy, even though the area within the scope has been removed.

A JavaScript closure is a function that refers to an independent variable (a variable used locally but defined in the surrounding range).
These functions remember the environment when they were created.

You can use specific region variables within a function that ended in this way.
First, let`s take a look at a simple example.

```js
function plus() {
var a = 0;
return function () {
return ++a;
}
}

var p = plus();
console.log(p()); // 1
console.log(p()); // 2
console.log(p()); // 3

```

The function `plus` is assigned to the variable `p` and the execution ends, but if you run `p`, you can use the declared variable `a` within the function `plus`.

While variable `a` is in use, it will not be GC.
Therefore, it is recommended that the variable `a` reference be eliminated according to the situation.

```js
'// Remove Reference
p = null;

```

# Closer on repeat

The variable `i` used when assigning values to array data only refers to `5`, which is the value of `i` with the repeat statement terminated at the time of the call.

```js
var arr = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
arr[i] = function () {
return i;
}
}

arr.forEach(function (el) {
console.log(el()); // 5 / 5 / 5 / 5 / 5
});

```

Assign a value as an immediate execution function (IFE) to equal the call and reference point.

```js
var arr = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
arr[i] = (function () {
return i;
}());
}

arr.forEach(function (el) {
console.log(el); // 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4
});

```

Let`s look at a more practical example.
Let`s click on the list to create an example of how the corresponding numbers in the list are output to the console.

```xml
<ul class="click">
<li>CLICK 1</li>
<li>CLICK 2</li>
<li>CLICK 3</li>
<li>CLICK 4</li>
</ul>

```

```js
var items = document.querySelectorAll('.click li');
for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
items[i].onclick = function () {
console.log('click' + i); // 'click4'
}
}

```

Only `click4` is output to the console.
The number is not output normally because the handler assigned to `onclick` is different from the time when the variable `i` is run and the time when the variable `i` is referenced.
Then we change it as below so that it can work well.

```js
var items = document.querySelectorAll('.click li');
for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
items[i].onclick = (function (j) {
return function () {
console.log('click' + j); // 'click0' / 'click1' / 'click2' / 'click3'
}
}(i))
}

```

Generates an execution function (external function) as soon as the handler is returned, and creates a region variable (parameter) so that the handler can reference the value.
The handler does not now refer to `i` in the repeated statement, but to the parameter `j` in the external function.
When you check the console, the numbers are printed well in order.

The `let` keyword in ES2015 (ES6) makes it easier to implement.

```js
var items = document.querySelectorAll('.click li');
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
items[i].onclick = function () {
console.log('click' + i); // 'click0' / 'click1' / 'click2' / 'click3'
}
}

```

# Encapsulation, concealment of closures

JavaScript uses `prototype` as a common object-oriented programming method, which uses the `this` keyword when creating properties to be used within an object.
Property `this` in the example below._name` has the meaning of `Private` based on naming convention by prefixing `_`.
However, JavaScript does not provide `access modifiers` such as `private`, `public`, and `protected`, so the attribute `_name` in the example only means `inaccessible` and can be accessed from outside.
Therefore, you can see the value by outputting it to the console as `a._name`.

```js
function Hello(name) {
this._name = name;
}

Hello.prototype = {
getName: function () {
return this._name;
},
setName: function (name) {
this._name = name;
}
}

var a = new Hello('good');

console.log(a._name); // 'good'
console.log(a.getName()); // 'good'

a.setName('nice');

console.log(a._name); // 'nice'
console.log(a.getName()); // 'nice'

```

Now, let`s do Encapsulation so that it`s not accessible from the outside.
Use the Immediate Run function.
Creates a `Hello` constructor by creating a separate object inside the immediate execution function and returning the object itself.
The `hidden` `_name` and `name` are no longer accessible externally.

```js
var Hello = (function () {
var _name;

function _Hello(name) {
_name = name;
}

_Hello.prototype = {
getName: function () {
return _name;
},
setName: function (name) {
_name = name;
}
}

return _Hello;
}());

var a = new Hello('good');

console.log(a._name); // undefined
console.log(a.getName()); // 'good'

a.setName('nice');

console.log(a._name); // undefined
console.log(a.getName()); // 'nice'

```

It`s not the same example, but for easier understanding, you can simplify the above code as shown below.

```js
function hello(name) {
var _name = name;

return {
getName: function () {
return _name;
},
setName: function (name) {
_name = name;
}
};
}

```

# Closer and this

In the example below, "this.The `name` keyword refers to the global `this` rather than `this` of the external function.
It works abnormally, but it actually happens in many areas.

```js
window.name = 'window';

var object = {
name: 'object',
getName: function () {
return (function () {
return this.name;
}());
}
}

console.log(object.getName()); // 'window'

```

This allows `this` to produce a separate reference variable `_this`.

```js
window.name = 'window';

var object = {
name: 'object',
getName: function () {
var _this = this;

return (function () {
return _this.name;
}());
}
}

console.log(object.getName()); // 'object'

```
