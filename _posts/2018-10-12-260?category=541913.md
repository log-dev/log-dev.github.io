Flex Box #2

As mentioned in the previous posting, flexbox layout mode is based on the ability to flexibly modify the width or height of flex items depending on the free space.

So, of course, flexbox modules provide excellent control over how to change the size of items.

In this posting, we will continue to look at the flex box attributes and functions that we haven`t explained before.

### order

The flex-flows, which allow you to specify flex-direction, flex-wrap, and these two short attributes in the preceding context, allow you to effectively control the order and direction of the flex item.

However, when it comes to visual order, there is a more controlling attribute called `order`.

The `order` property works in a similar way to the z-index concept because it accommodates integer-based values.

However, it determines where the flex items should appear in the flow of the element, rather than forming a layer.

All flex items are listed (arrayed) in the order in which they are written to the source (markup order) if the flex items share the same order value by default.

```css
/* Code for Safari 6.1 to 8.0 */
div#myRedDIV {-webkit-order: 2;}
div#myBlueDIV {-webkit-order: 4;}
div#myGreenDIV {-webkit-order: 3;}
div#myPinkDIV {-webkit-order: 1;}

/* Standard syntax */
div#myRedDIV {order: 2;}
div#myBlueDIV {order: 4;}
div#myGreenDIV {order: 3;}
div#myPinkDIV {order: 1;}
```

Must be specified in a flex item, not a flex container.

The good thing about using order is that it works independently of the actual content.

In other words, markups can be logically configured and the content structure can be freely placed regardless of the order of markups in terms of design, so they do not violate web accessibility (minimize the difficulty of web access for people using Screen Reader 1 or other complementary technology).

order attribute value

- number : Specifies the order of the flex items. The default value is 0.
- initial : Follow the default values for this property.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

### justify-content: horizontal alignment

The property `justify-content` is about sorting and is the property that handles horizontal alignment. (Excludes vertical writing or flex-direction values in columns.)

```css
div {
display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
-webkit-justify-content: space-around; /* Safari 6.1+ */
display: flex;
justify-content: space-around;
}
```

For justify-content values, use a Western way of writing, and the default flex-direction values behave under the assumption of row.

This means that the progression of the flex item is listed from left to right (→), and from top to bottom (↓).

CSS Syntax

> justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | initial | inherit;

property value of justify-content

- flex-start : Sort flex items by default to the beginning of the flex container (left).
- flex-end : Arranges flex items to the end of the container (right).
- center : Center the flex items in the center of the container.
- space-between : The first of the flex items aligns to the far left, the last to the far right, and the others arrange the space between them at regular intervals.
- space-around : Same as space-between, but the first and last items do not need to be aligned to the left and right ends of each, and the intervals are also distributed evenly around the sorted items.
- initial : Follow the default values for this property.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

### align-items

The `align-items` property allows you to control the alignment of flex items by associating them with each item.

For example, if you apply `display: flex;` to a flex container element so that all flex items have the same height and are perfectly side-by-side (arrayed), this is due to the default stretch of the align-items property. This default ensures that all items in a row adjust the same height to match the height of the item that contains the most content.

```css
div {
display: -webkit-flex; /* Safari */
-webkit-align-items: center; /* Safari 7.0+ */
display: flex;
align-items: center;
}
```

This property must be specified in a flex container, not in a flex entry.

CSS Syntax

align-items: stretch | center | flex-start | flex-end | baseline | initial | inherit;

Align-items property value

- stretch : Default as mentioned, adjust all flex items to match each other (equal height value).
- flex-start : Places the flex items at the beginning (left) of the flex container, but the height of each item depends on the amount of content in each item.
- flex-end : Same rule as flex-start, but places flex items down the container.
- center : Center each item is centered by vertical because it distributes the same space between the top and bottom of each item.
- baseline : Arranges all flex items around the baselines specified in the content. The baseline may vary for each item.
- initial : Follow the default values for this property.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

### align-self

The previous `align-items` property is usually applied to containers to sort the items they contain.

Other properties are directly applied to flex items and more strongly controlled, which allows you to specify how each item will be sorted, which is the `align-self` attribute.

This property has the same attribute values as align-items and works exactly the same.

The difference is that this property applies individually to flex items.

```css
#demo-01 {
-webkit-align-self: center; /* Safari 7.0+ */
align-self: center;
}
```

For example, if you assume that a flex item takes the stretch value, the default value for align-items, then all flex items will have the same height.

But what if you want one of these items to come to the bottom of the container and have the actual content height of the item?

You simply target individual items that you want to act in a different way, such as the code below.

```css
div:last-child {
-webkit-align-self: flex-end; /* Safari 7.0+ */
align-self: flex-end;
}
```

CSS Syntax

> align-self: auto | stretch | center | flex-start | flex-end | baseline | initial | inherit;

Align-self property value

- stretch : Adjusts all flex items to match (equal height value) by default.
- flex-start : Places the flex items at the beginning (left) of the flex container, but the height of each item depends on the amount of content in each item.
- flex-end : Same rule as flex-start, but places flex items down the container.
- center : Center each item is centered by vertical because it distributes the same space between the top and bottom of each item.
- baseline : Arranges all flex items around the baselines specified in the content. The baseline may vary for each item.
- initial : Follow the default values for this property.
- inherit : inherits the value from the parent element.

### align-content

The `align-content` property is the property that controls the alignment of flex containers in multiple columns.

This allows flex items to be organized (listed) into multiple columns. It works in the same way as `justify-content`, but only the axis that aligns is the opposite.

```undefined
<div class="container">
<div class="item">1. Lorem ipsum</div>
<div class="item">2. dolor sit amet</div>
<div class="item">3. consectetur adipisicing elit.</div>
<div class="item">4. Dolor dolorem dolores</div>
<div class="item">5. excepturi iure laborum</div>
<div class="item">6. placeat quis</div>
<div class="item">7. quod soluta</div>
<div class="item">8. sunt voluptatum.</div>
<div class="item">9. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
background: #eee;
width: 960px;
height: 600px;
margin: 0 auto;
display: -webkit-flex;
display: flex;
-webkit-flex-wrap: wrap;
flex-wrap: wrap;
/* Horizontal alignment */
-webkit-justify-content: space-around;
justify-content: space-around;
/* Vertical Alignment */
-webkit-align-content: space-around;
align-content: space-around;
}

.container .item {
box-sizing: border-box;
background: #ccc;
border: 1px solid #fff;
width: 320px;
height: 120px;
}
```

CSS Syntax

> align-content: stretch | center | flex-start | flex-end | space-between | space-around | initial | inherit;

assign-content property value

- stretch : By default, adjust the height of the items to the same height as the container.
- center : Distribute space equal to the top and bottom of columns. So it`s centered around the vertical direction.
- flex-start : Aligns the columns to the top of the container. The free space is shown below these columns.
- flex-end : Aligns columns to the bottom of the container. The free space is displayed above these columns.
- space-between: The first line comes to the top of the container, the last line comes to the bottom of the container, and the other columns are aligned at equal intervals between them.
- space-around : follows the same rule as space-between, but some of the extra space is distributed above the first line and below the last line, and the first and last lines do not align with the top and bottom end of the container.

### Browser Support Status for Flexbox

Flexbox specifications have already undergone several major checks on property names, grammar and some features.

As a result, both leading developers and browser vendors have become cautious about this module, and to support this flexbox, some browsers have decided to remove vendor prefixes.

Although the old grammar of the Flexbox is still in use, the browser is still in a transition phase to support updated modules.

Just as the mobile market has undergone a brief transition, it is not long before Flexbox becomes a new module.

### at the end

Flexbox is new, exciting, and innovative. Most of all, it`s a module that CSS must have today in order to become a comprehensive tool for responding to movement and implementing web pages.

There`s still a long way to go before this flexbox can be a real tool for layout, but after multiple browsers support it and remove the prefixes, people in this industry will follow one step back if they have initial fear and vigilance of modules.

At this moment when the support situation of Flexbox is stabilizing a lot, I hope it will be an opportunity to recognize that it is not far away from the future, but to experiment in various ways.
