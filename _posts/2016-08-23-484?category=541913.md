Adding shadows to a box element

Similar to the `text-shadow` property, CSS3 provides the `box-shadow` property as a way to add shadows to box elements.

### box-shadow

The box-shadow syntax is similar to the text-shadow syntax.

The `box-shadow` syntax is as follows:

```css
.selector {
box-shadow: inset horizontal vertical blur spread color;
}
```

The first value, inset, is a keyword that lets you choose whether the shadow appears inside or outside the element.

If you do not set the set value separately, the default value causes a shadow outside the element.

The following values are keywords for setting the length, which determine how often the shadow will appear horizontally or vertically from the box element.

These values must be set to make shadows appear.

The following values set the degree of blur effect, which is also expressed in length:

The next value, spread, is the value to set the distance the shadow spreads widely.

When you apply a length value that is a positive number of spreads, the shadow appears larger than the element, and when you apply a negative number, the shadow appears smaller than the element.

Both blur and spread are optional.

Finally, set the color value. This value is required in the Webkit browser, but is optional in Firefox and Opera, and if you do not specify a separate color, it will be expressed in black.

The following code applies to the values corresponding to the keywords described so far:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="300" width="100%" name="cp_embed_1" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/qNvpEX?height=300&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=qNvpEX&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_1" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_qNvpEX"></iframe>

The style rule above represents a dark gray shadow in the outer area of the element (no inset applied), moving 4px in both landscape and longitudinal directions, and applying a 3px blur effect.

To determine the difference between the shadows of box elements depending on the value of the `box-shadow` property, look at the following code:

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="382" width="100%" name="cp_embed_2" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/BzbJdg?height=382&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=BzbJdg&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_2" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_BzbJdg"></iframe>

Until now, we have only identified the default outset that has not been specified, and now we will use the keyword `inset`.

When the set keyword is applied, it will appear to have a shadow inside the box, which may appear as if the shadow was flipped on the other side of the box.

In other words, normal shadows without an offset (set to an outset) are applied with a positive x,y value and a shadow appears at the bottom right of the box, but when an offset is applied, the shadow appears at the top left of the box.

For a more specific explanation, let`s take the example code we used earlier and add the insert keyword to each element to check it out.

<iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowpaymentrequest="true" allowtransparency="true" class="cp_embed_iframe " frameborder="0" height="353" width="100%" name="cp_embed_3" scrolling="no" src="https://codepen.io/jaehee/embed/wWONrG?height=353&amp;theme-id=19458&amp;slug-hash=wWONrG&amp;default-tab=result&amp;user=jaehee&amp;embed-version=2&amp;name=cp_embed_3" style="width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;" title="CodePen Embed" loading="lazy" id="cp_embed_wWONrG"></iframe>

The results of the execution in the example appear to be upside down, as opposed to the shadow effect of `outset`.

Shadows appear inside the box to which `inset` is applied, in opposite corners of the box.

It is easy to understand if you think that the x and y axes change when the inset is applied for easy understanding.

In other words, the `inset` setting changes the horizontal, longitudinal, and lateral values, the longitudinal positive values are expressed to the left, the negative values to the right, and the lateral positive values to the top, and the negative values to the bottom.
