The Windows USB/DVD Download Tool introduced earlier can be built quickly, but there is a disadvantage of not being able to specify other options. Recently, GPT partitions using UEFI boot are popular, so let`s learn about Rufus, which provides convenience.

Windows 10 can produce USB or DVD with Windows 10 downloads provided by Microsoft. However, the GPT partition setting using UEFI is not supported.

### Introducing Rufus

Rufus is a USB driver format, such as a USB key/pendrive or memory stick, and is a utility that allows users to boot from USB simultaneously the same time. Windows 8/8.1 Installation - How to create a UEFI bootable disk (UEFI installation) is often reported as successful by creating a bootable disk using Rufus.

- Bootable ISO files (Windows, Linux, UEFI, etc.) can be installed using USB when necessary.
- It is available when it is necessary to work on a system that does not have an OS installed.
- It is available when a bios or DOS firmware flash is required.
- Available when you want to run a low-level utility.
- It is small in capacity but works fast and is twice as fast as other similar utilities.

### Install Rufus

It can be downloaded from the Rufus homepage above. It is distributed as an executable file that can be run immediately without the installation process. When executed, the update connection will be made as shown below, but if "No" is selected, it will not be executed...

A 32-bit or 64-bit Windows XP or later operating system. It is available immediately after downloading.

UEFI/GPT support requires Windows Vista or later operating systems, and Windows XP is limited in creating bootable UEFI drives in MBR mode.

### Create Boot Disk

First, it prepares the Windows image ISO file for installation. For Windows 10, the latest version of Windows 10 can be downloaded via Windows 10 Disk Image Download (ISO file). Prepare a 4Gb or higher USB, insert it into your computer, run Rufus, and select Yes when the UAC prompt appears.

- Verify that the USB drive inserted from the device is correct, and select the ISO image using the ISO image button at the bottom (the ISO image will be initialized when the ISO image is selected later).
- Under Disk Format and Boot System Type, select Partition Format.
BIOS or UEFI-CSM (BIOS) compatibility in MBR partition format: the use of MBR partitions in conventional BIOS-mounted formats is largely this way.
UEFI in MBR partition format: the use of MBR partitions on newer UEFI-mounted models, which is often installed in this manner if there is no information on GPT partitions.
UEFI in GPT partition format is when GPT partitions are used on newer UEFI-mounted models.

- UEFI in GPT partition format is when GPT partitions are used on newer UEFI-mounted models.
- To select a file system, UEFI recommends FAT32 as the default (UEFI requires a separate bootloader partition formatted with FAT and does not support NTFS except for some businesses). If it is not UEFI, a faster boot disk can be created with NTFS.
- Start the process with the Start button.

### Completion

When all is done, shut down rufus, remove USB, and try inserting it again.
