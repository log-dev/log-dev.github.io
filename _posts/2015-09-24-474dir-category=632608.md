We investigated the meta tag question during the production of T-story Skin. Please refer to those interested in skin production.

### meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible"

IE For browser users, the following code is often used to render in the latest document mode:

```html
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">

```

This, as described in the X-UA-Compatible, IE=edge, and Compatibility views, forces it to the latest document without having to mention it separately in the meta-tag.

Below is the result of requesting the header of the blog without inserting an x-ua-compatible meta-tag.

> In the past, I wondered that the meta tag appeared to be an error in Validate HTML, so I asked for the header of the T-story to look at it and found the related information was found. With the current version of Validate HTML being replaced with the latest version, related error messages also disappeared.

### meta name="description"

In skin production, a substitute patient is sometimes written on the meta tag in charge of the document`s description, indicating the blog description provided by T-story as follows.

```html
<meta name="description" content="[ ##_desc_##]">

```

In such cases, the same description is exposed to every article on the blog. This is a false understanding of the description meta-tag, which differs from the original purpose of listing a summary of what the document contains and information about the article.

Google is actually presenting good meta-explanatory guidelines, and mentions the above problems with writing.

> Create a different description for each page. Creating the same or similar description for all pages on a site is not good when each page is published in web search results. If the description is similar or identical, Google is less likely to display the phrase. If possible, please write a description that accurately represents a specific page. The default home page or other comprehensive pages use a site-level description, and the page-level description everywhere else. If you don't have time to write a description on every page, please prioritize your content. At a minimum, you must write a description of an important URL, such as the homepage and popular page.

In fact, to get this right, Google needs to understand logic that utilizes meta-descriptions. It is our problem that there is no accessible information related to it. In the past, the meta-tags were used to expose meta-descriptions under the title link of the document, but the current Google logic was changed whether it was recognized that there were not many people working on them and that other information was often listed. Most of the documents are summarized and exposed, and it is unclear on what grounds they are doing so.

On the side of T-story, it would be desirable to create a summary box to write a description meta when writing, or to provide a replacement so that even the contents summarized by the Open Graph protocol, which is already supported by itself.

Although there seems to be no hope because it is a T-story that does not provide any dental patients that can extract representative images.

An alternative option for skin producers to think about is to dynamically insert a summary of the document in the description meta section. Due to the nature of T-story, it cannot be used except for JavaScript, but even if it is possible, I could not think that the search engine would collect such changes. It is known that crawlers collect only HTML or xml parsed results from the server side. In the end, I thought only server-side scripts could solve this problem.

However!! The search provided access to the article Dynamicly Added Meta Data Indexed By Google Crawlers and provided relevant information. Surprisingly! Google has decided to understand the pages executed by JavaScript and has been implementing them since 2014. The above link is an experiment on dynamically adding descriptive meta based on it.

It is the result of experiments that are not 100% sure yet, but it will be possible in the future. If you are curious, let`s approach the link above.
