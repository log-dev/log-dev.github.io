T-story was not a place to support something for reactive skin types. As T-story said that they are preparing a new skin after the skin contest, they are updating the basic system one by one. Not long ago, I was embarrassed by the change in the expression of the date, but what I found this time is information related to the image inserted in the text.

### Support for reactive images

In the meantime, in order to modify the body image inserted as an editor during the production of T-story Skin to fit the reactive design, the relevant code had to be written directly as below.

```css
.img-responsive,
.imageblock img {
display: block;
width: 100% \9;
max-width: 100%;
height: auto;
}

```

- `.img-response` is provided by Bootstrap for supporting reactive images.
- `.imageblock img` is needed to select images that are inserted as T-story editors.

Recently, the T-story Skin was newly modified, and it was found that the image automatically decreases to fit the screen size in skins that have not yet applied the style to support reactive images. Just in case, I looked into the related style and found the added CSS part as below.

```html
<span class="imageblock" style="
display: inline-block;
width: 800px;
height: auto;
max-width:100%
">
<img src="http://cfile7.uf.tistory.com/image/xxxxxxxxx" style="
cursor: pointer;
max-width: 100%;
height: auto
" width="800" height="533">
</span>

```

The "max-width:100%;height:auto" part is essential for reactive image support. I don`t know when it was changed, but it must be a good thing. Of course, T-Story`s move does not include support for older IE, probably because it officially abandoned support for older versions of IE (because it was missing support for older versions at the time of the Skin Contest), but most skin producers also offer non-responsive, fixed designs.

> Personally, they hope to provide similar support for embed elements such as YouTube videos and Vimeo videos. The fact that T-story is paying attention to reactive design is expected to be the next official skin type, and that is probably the time for a big change in skin production.
