Use of Font

The first thing you consider when you want to create a more exciting website is to assign different fonts to each element that makes up the page, such as a title or paragraph.

All recent browsers support what is called a Web Font, and the typeface that goes down when you view a site is called a Web font.

Web fonts also use the `font-family` property, but can be used using a CSS command called the `@font-face` directive to inform the web browser to download the font.

Users can choose to use only the typefaces that are already validated (only the default typefaces installed on most computers) or choose to write one of the more fonts using the web font (although there will be more work).)

You don`t have to be tied to any of these methods. Typically, you use both methods, in some cases using standard fonts (the main part of the page that contains the text), and in others using web fonts (the command, if you need to create an eye-catching heading).

Unfortunately, the introduction of web fonts in Korea is not active due to the large number of characters, but related services such as Google Web Fonts service and Typekit and Cufon are active in foreign countries.

And in Korea, Mobilis Webfont seems to have the most font service.

### font-family

Even if you specify a typeface using the `font-family` property, there is no guarantee that visitors will see a page that is displayed in the typeface specified. The font must be already installed on the visitor`s computer or temporarily down with the site`s visit if the font is a Web font.

So, when you use a web font, you often put it on a server on a web site.

Anyway, since there is no guarantee that your preferred typeface will be available to visitors, it is common practice to specify the alternative font to use if there is no major typeface.

If the first typeface specified in font-family does not exist on your computer, the browser skips through the font list specified in font-family until it finds an available typeface. Therefore, you often use the following list of pseudopraphs that are installed by default on most operating systems:

```css
body {
font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

For the above code, use the Times New Roman font in your web browser if you are looking for it. If it`s not installed, you`ll go through the next font, then the next font.

Also, if the typeface name consists of one or more words, such as the Time New Roman font, it should be enclosed in quotation marks.

### Using Web Font

The traditional way to use fonts in CSS is intuitive.

The CSS code used for web fonts is very simple and requires only two CSS commands.

- The @font-face directive tells the web browser the font name and where to download it. The behavior of this command is explored later.
- The usage of the font-family property is the same as the normal font mentioned above. Once the browser has been informed to download the typeface using @font-face, any CSS will be available via font-family, just like regular fonts.

### Font Type

Believe it or not, IE has supported web fonts since IE5. Unfortunately, however, we have to use unique and tricky methods to format and type.

This means that the font must be converted to an Embedded Open Type (EOT) file.(By IE8, it still is.))

The file types used in web fonts are various other than this, and some of them have supported browser restrictions.

The font file type (type) and support browser information are summarized below.

- Embedded Open Type (EOT) : Only for IE. Conversion of regular font files to EOT requires special tools.
- When you open the TrueType and OpenType : Fonts folders on your computer, you will see .ttf (TrueType format) and .otf (OpenType format) typefaces files. This is a popular file format for computer typefaces. It can be used not only for web pages, but also for word processing and electronic publishing. This type of typeface file is supported by most browsers and includes the latest versions of IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, iOS Safari (4.2+), and BlackBerry browsers, including IE9.
- Web Open Font Format (WOFF): This file is a file format designed as the primary destination for the Web. The WOFF typeface is a compression of either TrueType or OpenType typeface by default, so the file size is usually smaller and is downloaded faster than other typefaces. WOFF files are supported by various browser manufacturers and are supported by IE9 and other modern browsers and iOS Safari (5+). However, Android does not support this file, so Android devices or IE8 users cannot download or display typefaces.
- Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG): This file is not actually a typeface file. SVG is actually a file for vector graphics (a technique for creating images that maintain quality when magnified). Browsers that support SVG fonts are very limited to IE and FF. Another problem with SVG is that the file size is almost twice as large as the TrueType and nearly three times the WOFF file. The real benefit of using SVG is that it is the only type of web font recognized in versions prior to iOS Safari 4.1.

### To create (convert) various font files

To provide fonts for as many browsers as possible, users must provide at least EOT, WOFF, and Truetype typefaces.

The Font Squirerel site has web-based tools to help you create your own font file.

One of the menus on this site is the Generator, which lets you create not only font files, but also HTML file examples and basic CSS style sheets.

How to use the @font-face Generator

- Find the .ttf font or .otf web font you want to use (which is licensed to use as a web font).
- Click UPLOAD FONTS in the Generator menu of the site above and upload the typeface file you want to use.
- Coversion option

- Basic: Convert typefaces to EOT, WOFF, and SVG types.
- Optimal: It is a good option because it not only converts files but also improves font performance and speed.
- Expert : Option to allow all details related to the conversion to be adjusted. Only a portion of the typeface can be converted (i.e., only the selected characters can be included) in the typeface file, i.e., if there are characters that are not in use, such as a semicolon symbol or exclamation point, or even a regular character, such as Q.

Select Optimal if you think you will use all the letters.

### Legal issues with web fonts.

To use Web typefaces, you must also resolve legal issues. Just like software, a wide variety of individuals and corporate providers create and sell serpents, and when you place TrueType typefaces on a web server so that visitors can use them to view pages, you should remember that anyone can download them and use them in their website or word processing programs.

Most font manufacturers have a licensing policy that prohibits them from using the web, so even the typefaces purchased from Adobe cannot be used on the web without any action. To do so, you need to purchase a different kind of license at a different price.

While it is acceptable to use it for programs that are installed on your computer, it may not be acceptable to place the font on a web server and use it as a web font.

If you`re not sure if you`re allowed to use it on the web, you`d better give up using it and look for the typefaces available on the web.

How to use the @font-face directive

Once you`ve downloaded the required font file, it`s time to actually try it out.

First, move the files to the location where you keep the website files on your computer and create a folder under the top folder of the Saart (which also uses the name fonts, webfonts).

If you want, you can put the font file in the folder where you put the CSS file. Actually, it doesn`t matter where you put the font file on your site, and it`s good to organize it well.

### Web font compatibility

As you can see in the table above, modern browsers support all of the woff files, so it`s easy to use.

What always bothers us is the old version of IE, but browsers under IE8 must use the eot file.

In Korea, we use the sharing font series that is distributed free of charge by Naver.

NANUM-WEB-FONT.ZIP

### Web Font Syntax

Web font magic starts with a CSS command called the @font-face directive.

This command tells the browser the name of the font to use and where it can be downloaded.

The code below briefly describes how to use it.

```css
@font-face {
font-family: <a-remote-font-name>
src: <source> [, <source>]*;
[font-weight: <weight>];
[font-style: <style>];
}
```

The contents of the attribute values are as follows.

- <a-remote-font-name> : Sets the name to be specified by the font name in the font property.</a-remote-font-name>
- > : A property that specifies a URL value indicating the location of a remote font file, or that specifies the font name installed on the user`s computer in the format "Font Name".
- <weight> : font thickness value.</weight>
- > : Font style value.

### Web Font Simple Usage (example using Web font simplicity)

```css
@font-face {
font-family:ng;
src:url(NanumGothic.eot);
src:local(※), url(NanumGothic.woff) format('woff')
}

body{font-family:'나눔고딕', 'NanumGothic', ng}
```

- Declare the font name ng (name can be written as desired) only once, then refer sequentially to eot and woff formats
- IE6-8 only requests eot fonts and displays them on the screen (see eot format before woff format).
- IE 9 and Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera only request woff fonts, so the browser must download eot fonts because there is no format (`eot`) declaration for eot fonts by @font-face specification, but not cleverly.
- The value of `local` makes it possible to refer to the fonts installed in the system first before referring to external resources. However, this code prevents IE6–IE8 from requesting additional woff fonts using features that fail to handle local() values.
- The `£ symbol` included inside parentheses of the local value is a random designation of a font that may not exist in the user system. The reason for using special characters with 2 bytes is that Mac OS does not process system font names with 2 bytes strings at all.
- If you explicitly create a format (`woff`) value, only browsers that support this format will download fonts. The value must be in single or double quotes, and if not written, it is a specification to download all types of fonts, regardless of whether they are supported or not. In order to prevent downloading without supporting fonts, the code is explicitly written to download external fonts only if this format is supported. IE 7-8 browsers do not interpret this code, so they do not require additional woff fonts, but that is not the purpose.
- The reason why the names of the Nanum Gothic system fonts are written in Korean and English twice is because there are browsers that cannot be displayed properly when written in English, and it is recommended that fonts with Korean names be written in both Korean and English.

### @font-face Example of actual use

Use the code below to learn more details.

```css
@font-face {
font-family:'NanumGothic';
src:url('fonts/NanumGothic.eot');
src:url('fonts/NanumGothic.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
url('fonts/NanumGothic.woff') format('woff'),
url('fonts/NanumGothic.ttf') format('truetype'),
url('fonts/NanumGothic.svg') format('svg');
}
```

- The third line is required due to the compatibility mode of IE9. In compatibility mode, IE9 is rendered as IE8. This strange feature is intended to ensure that websites designed to take into account bugs in IE8 (or earlier versions of IE) are also visible in IE9. The compatibility mode in IE9 requires the user to intentionally enable it, so if you don`t consider it, you probably don`t mind excluding this line.
- The second src property starts from the fourth line. The first font file is the `.eot` file, but at the end of the file name, `?The `#iefix` is attached. This is necessary because of the bugs in the browser from IE6 to 8. If you do not paste ?#iefix after the .eot in the URL, the font will not display properly in IE8 and its subversion.

### To add bold typefaces or italic typefaces (Bold, Italic)

An easy way to add a bold or italic font is to use the `font-weight` and `font-style` properties of the @font-face directive.

However, you must specify the @font-face corresponding to the bold typeface or italics file.

For example, let`s look at Nanum Gothic general typefaces, bold typefaces, and italics.

```css
@font-face {
font-family:'NanumGothic';
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicRegular.eot');
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicRegular.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicRegular.woff') format('woff'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicRegular.ttf') format('truetype');
font-weight: normal;
font-style: normal;
}

@font-face{
font-family:'NanumGothic';
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicBold.eot');
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicBold.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicBold.woff') format('woff'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicBold.ttf') format('truetype');
font-weight: bold;
font-style: normal;
}

@font-face{
font-family:'NanumGothic';
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicItalic.eot');
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicItalic.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicItalic.woff') format('woff'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicItalic.ttf') format('truetype');
font-weight: normal;
font-style: italic;
}
```

You must use @font-face three times to support all three typefaces, as shown in the code above.

And it should be noted that the names written in the font-family are always the same, with the names written in the font-family being the same.

Like Nanum GothicBold, it does not use a name that refers to a particular typeface style.

It can also be used by specifying and unifying user-defined font names (e.g., defined as Nanum).

The advantage of this method is that the browser takes care of chores such as loading and using typefaces, as long as the user focuses on properly tagging HTML text such as `em` and `strong`.

In other words, you do not need to specify the bold typeface in the <strong> tag.

Unfortunately, however, the aforementioned method does not work under IE8. Perhaps the Nanum Gothic regular font will be applied to all texts.

IE creates fake italic typefaces and fake bold typefaces to be applied to <em> and <strong>.

In other words, it is to manipulate the font of Nanum Gothic Regular to display it in italic letters or bold letters on the screen.

### Support for boldface/italic typefaces below IE8

There is a little more work to do to support IE8 and earlier browsers.

The instructions for @font-face should be modified as follows.

```css
@font-face {
font-family:'NanumGothicRegular';
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicRegular.eot');
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicRegular.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicRegular.woff') format('woff'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicRegular.ttf') format('truetype');
font-weight: normal;
font-style: normal;
}

@font-face{
font-family:'NanumGothicBold';
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicBold.eot');
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicBold.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicBold.woff') format('woff'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicBold.ttf') format('truetype');
}

@font-face{
font-family:'NanumGothicItalic';
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicItalic.eot');
src:url('fonts/NanumGothicItalic.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicItalic.woff') format('woff'),
url('fonts/NanumGothicItalic.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```

If you look at the code above, please note that a separate font-family name has been used. The name was given according to the typeface style supported and the font-weight and font-style properties were not used.

It does not end here, but you must specify the font name according to the tag (which may vary depending on the web page creation environment):

```css
p {
font-family: NanumGothicRegular;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: normal;
}

em {
font-family: NanumGothicItalic;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: normal;
}

strong {
font-family: NanumGothicBold;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: normal;
}
```

Another thing to note is that as you can see in the code above, we specify the font-weight and font-style as normal. Otherwise, many browsers, including IE, will try to re-bold `text already in bold` or `text already in italics`.(Firefox makes and processes very ugly fake typefaces)

This technique will certainly take a lot of work and become more serious if there are many types of typefaces that need to be used within the site.

What method to use will depend on how important IE8 support is to you.

### Using Webfont inside @media rule

This method is used to avoid downloading web fonts on mobile devices, etc. using media queries.

IE 9 uses conditional annotations because it ignores the @font-face in the media query.

```css
<!–[if IE 9]>
<style>
/* This code is used only in IE 9 */
@font-face{
font-family:ng;
src: url(NanumGothic.eot)
}

body{ font-family:나눔고딕, NanumGothic, ng }
</style>
<![endif]–>
```

The rest of the browsers use media query.

```css
/* IE 9 does not support @font-face within @media */
@media all and (min-width:768px) {
@font-face{
font-family:ng;
src:url(NanumGothic.eot);
src:local(※), url(NanumGothic.woff) format('woff')
}

body {
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
}
}
```

IE 6-8 browsers do not support media queries, so they require libraries such as response.js, a type of Polyfill.
