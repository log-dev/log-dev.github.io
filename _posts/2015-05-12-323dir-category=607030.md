### ACCESSKEY Properties

The accesskey property specifies the access key. The computer`s primary input device is the keyboard, not the mouse. Therefore, all elements in the document must be controlled by the keyboard.

```html
<a href="http://www.google.com/" accesskey="g">Google</a>

```

- Elements with accensski properties are either focused or executed. When applied to input element, it receives focus, and when applied to element a, press the corresponding key to move to the destination immediately.
- The attribute value is specified by selecting the desired character from the alphabet or number on the keyboard.
- When defining two or more characters in a single element, they are separated by spacing.
- Refer to the UK Government`s shortcut key recommendation to avoid duplicate shortcut keys.

The class attribute specifies the class name defined in the style sheet.

### DIR Properties

The dir property is a property that specifies the text direction. Text can proceed in two directions.

```html
<p dir="rtl">Write this text right-to-left!</p>

```

- `dir="ltr" : expresses text from left to right.
- `dir="rtl" : Express text from right to left.
- `dir="auto" : The element with this attribute follows the browser`s settings.

### ID Properties

The id property is the only identifier of an element.

```html
<h1 id="myHeader">Hello World!</h1>
<button onclick="displayResult()">Change text</button>

```

The attribute value must be the only value within the document and contain at least one character that does not have a blank character.

### LANG Properties

When the lang attribute is set to the html element, the inheritance characteristics are given the same value to all of the elements below. If various human languages are used within the content, each of the specific elements can be re-declared. User agents, such as web browsers and voice browsers, help interpret the language written in web documents correctly.

It is used effectively in search results of search engines and pronunciation of voice devices. For a complete list of languages, see http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry.

```html
<html lang="ko">

```

Ko is Korean and ko_KR is Korean. Just as American English (en_US) and British English (en_GB), English is subdivided into several languages.

XHTML1.0 uses the lang and xml:lang properties for text/html, and XHTML1.1 uses the xml:lang properties only.

```html
<html xml:lang="ko" lang="ko">

```

### STYLE Properties

The style property specifies an inline style for the element.

```html
<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center">This is a header</h1>
<p style="color:green">This is a paragraph.</p>

```

### TABINDEX Properties

The tabindex property specifies the tab order. The tabindex attribute is that the keyboard tab keys can be used to move in the tab navigation order and change this order. The order of tab navigation is the same as the order of receiving focus.

```html
<input type="text" tabindex="100">
<input type="password" tabindex="200">

```

- Hold the tabindex value large, such as 100,200,300, so that other elements can intervene in the middle and make it easier to modify even if the tabindex is needed.
- Specify a value of -1 to avoid creating focus.
- Press the tab key to proceed in the direction of the lower property value → the higher property value, and press Shift and the tab key to proceed in the reverse direction.

### TITLE Properties

The title property specifies a title for the element. The title here refers to additional information about a particular element, not a name to represent the content, such as the title of the document. It has an additional, additional, and advisory nature and is primarily used to describe the characteristics or properties of a particular element, and can be used for almost any element.

- Tool tip: Hover the mouse over the linked text or input control, and text specified by the title attribute appears in the form of a balloon.
- Voice output: An auxiliary device that outputs content by voice outputs text specified by the title attribute in voice output.

- a Element: Used to provide a complete title in a list of summary titles when describing where the link is headed and what happens when a link is clicked.
HTML
`<a href="http://www.naver.com/" target="_blank" title="새창">naver</a>
`
- p Element: Used to provide comments about paragraphs.
HTML
``[Pitle=] will be revised in the next session.``
`
- img element: used when additional explanations regarding image files are needed.
HTML
``<img src="shose.jpg" alt="Children`s Isometric" title="The size in the picture is the same as it is.">
`
- input element: Used when a description of the input control is required.
HTML
`<input type="tel" title="Enter Numbers Only">
`
- abbr element: used to solve abbreviations or acronyms. It is recommended that high-importance abbreviations be printed directly into the text without being described as a title attribute.
HTML
`<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>
`
The title property can be used to avoid complicating the content of the text with descriptions or annotations of the elements.
