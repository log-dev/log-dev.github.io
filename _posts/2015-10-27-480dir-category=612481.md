In some applications, you may have encountered designs that take into account user convenience, such as advertisements at the bottom or menus at the top. There are a lot of snippets related to it, and I introduce one of them.

### Introducing Headroom.js

A headroom is a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript widget that detects a user`s scrolling and adds action to the desired element. This is frequently used for top navigation, eliminating the proportion of screens occupied by conventional fixed navigation and appearing according to the user`s response, making it more flexible to obtain a visible area of the screen.

The headroom relies on the browser APIs below, so older browsers have restrictions (follow the links in each list to see browser support).

- requestAnimationFrame
- classList
- Function.prototype.bind

These APIs can be replaced by polyfill for older browsers, and can only be applied to supported browsers if desired.

- request-frame
- classList.js : IE8+
- Function.prototype.bind()

> Since there are snippets that mimic similar functions, it may be wise to look into them to support older browsers.

### Headroom.js Operating Principles

The principle underlying the headroom is to add and remove classes in response to scroll events.

```html
<!-- initially -->
<header class="headroom">

<!-- scrolling down -->
<header class="headroom headroom--unpinned">

<!-- scrolling up -->
<header class="headroom headroom--pinned">

```

When a headroom is applied, the class name specified is added or deleted according to the scrolling movement, and the behavior that can be caused by that class can be defined. The availability of classes means that they provide flexibility to give multiple elements multiple actions.

### How to use Headroom.js

JavaScript, jQuery, Zepto, and AngularJS are supported, and you can check the website for additional setup methods.

After inserting the `headroom.js` file:

```undefined
'// Select the element to be applied
var myElement = document.querySelector("header");

// create a headroom instance to forward
var headroom = new Headroom(myElement);

// Initialize
headroom.init();

```

Insert both `headroom.js` and `jQuery.headroom.js` files:

```undefined
// Simple initialization
$("#header").headroom();

```

It also provides `data-*` API so that it can be initialized directly from HTML.

```html
<!-- selects $("[data-headroom]") -->
<header data-headroom>

```

The headroom can change the way it behaves using optional objects. You can view the default options by examining `Headroom.options` and the structure of the optional object is as follows:

```undefined
{
// The value of the vertical position pixel that the fixed element is released for the first time and will disappear (operate as soon as it is scrolled if it is zero)
offset : 0,
// Scroll tolerance for pixels starting to change state
tolerance : 0,
// or individually specified by scroll up/down
tolerance : {
up : 5,
down : 0
},
// CSS classes to be applied
classes : {
// Name of the class that is added when the element is initialized
initial : "headroom",
// Class name added when scrolling up
pinned : "headroom--pinned",
// Class name added when under scroll
unpinned : "headroom--unpinned",
// The class name that is added when the scroll is within the value specified in the offset
top : "headroom--top",
// Class name added when scroll is outside the value specified in offset
notTop : "headroom--not-top"
},
// element to listen to scroll events on, defaults to `window`
scroller : someElement,
// callback when pinned, `this` is headroom object
onPin : function() {},
// callback when unpinned, `this` is headroom object
onUnpin : function() {},
// callback when above offset, `this` is headroom object
onTop : function() {},
// callback when below offset, `this` is headroom object
onNotTop : function() {},
}

```

As noted above, after initializing the headroom, the classes set in the options are added and deleted according to the response of the scroll. It is up to the user to add and remove the desired behavior using these classes. Below is a simple example of showing or hiding elements according to scrolling.

```css
.headroom--pinned {
display:block;
}
.headroom--unpinned {
display: none;
}

```

In order to express this behavior more dynamically, it can also give various animation effects using `transform`, `transition`, and `keyframes` of CSS. I hope you can apply various CSS animation effects through search, and sites such as Animate.css will be helpful.
