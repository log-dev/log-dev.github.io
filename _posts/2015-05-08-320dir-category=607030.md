### TEXTAREA ELEMENTS

The textarea element displays the text area (TEXT AREA). If a text field is a single-line input control, the text area is a multi-line input control.

```html
<textarea rows="8" cols="40">
...
</textarea>

```

The cols property specifies the number of characters that can be entered in a vertical row. This specifies the width of the text area by the number of characters, which defaults to 20. If the text area is over 20 characters, the width of the text area that was originally stored remains the same as the scrollbar was created.

The maxlength property specifies the maximum number of characters a user can enter. If this property is specified, no more characters are entered when the maximum number of characters is exceeded. Since users do not know whether or not to limit the number of characters, it is recommended that they provide a phrase that tells the maximum number of characters around the text area.

```html
<input type="text" maxlength="140">

```

The write property specifies a line change. This property determines how the inputted text flow is handled when the text region is transferred to the server. In other words, you can specify whether or not to automatically change the line to the next line when the text is complete.

- `wrap="off" : This property value does not change continuously. When a line is filled up, no line changes occur and text entry continues on the same line. Instead, a scroll bar appears at the bottom of the text area.
- `wrap="soft" : Transmits text that is entered without wrapping. Of course, when typing in a text area, filling in one line automatically causes a line change to the next, but no line change occurs when sending. The wrapper attribute is soft by default.
- `wrap="hard" : Transfers inputted text with a line change applied. When typing in a text area, a line change occurs automatically when one line is filled in, which is maintained and sent to the server.

### SELECT Element

The select element displays SELECTION control. Selection controls are controls for selecting OPTION elements and are designed to make option lists available like menus, similar to drop-down lists.

```html
<select>
<option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
<option value="saab">Saab</option>
<option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
<option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>

```

- The select and option elements are used together.
- The select element displays the selection control and the option element displays the option item.

The multiple attribute specifies multiple selections. The drop-down list can select only one option by default, but the multiple property exposes four options so that multiple options can be selected at a time.

```html
<select multiple>
<option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
<option value="saab">Saab</option>
<option value="opel">Opel</option>
<option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>

```

- The size attribute must be used to expose more options than the default four option exposures.
- Multiple choices are made by pressing the CTRL key on Windows and the command key on Mac OS while selecting the option.

The size property specifies the size of the selection control. This size refers to the size of the display area where the option is exposed.

```html
<select size="3">
<option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
<option value="saab">Saab</option>
<option value="opel">Opel</option>
<option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>

```

- Specifying a size of 1 results in only one line of display area (default).
- A property value of more than 2 reveals all options.

### OPTIONAL ELEMENTS

The option element displays an option list. The option list is a collection of items that users can choose from.

```html
<select>
<option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
<option value="saab" selected="selected">Saab</option>
<option value="opel">Opel</option>
<option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>

```

- Use with select or datalist elements.
- It cannot contain any other elements and may only contain text.

The value property specifies the value sent to the server. If this property is not specified, text marked up by the option element is sent to the server.

The selected property specifies the preselected option. The list of options is listed on a certain basis and provided with the first option selected by default. If you want to change these default choices, you can specify the selected property.

### OPTGROUP Element

The optgroup element displays the Option GROUP. An option group is a group created by a group of one or more options. If the number of options is high, grouping similar options improves convenience.

```html
<select>
<optgroup label="Swedish Cars">
<option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
<option value="saab">Saab</option>
</optgroup>
<optgroup label="German Cars">
<option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
<option value="audi">Audi</option>
</optgroup>
</select>

```

- The optgroup element consists of the parent element and the option element consists of the child element.
- Specifying label properties results in the title (label) of the option group.

### BUTTON ELEMENTS

The button element indicates the button. A button is a type of input device that selects/executes a programmed command when a user is selected. The input element can also be used to display buttons, and there is no functional difference between the two methods.

```html
<button type="button">Click Me!</button>
<button type="submit">전송 버튼</button>
£button type="reset">initialize button</button>

```

- Unlike the input element, it can contain other elements or content, and the content does not matter whether it is text or image.
- `type="submit" : default, but IE6~7 did not follow standard specifications.
- `type="button" : Manipulate interface with help from JavaScript. (default for IE6-7 browsers)
- `type="reset" : function to initialize form inputs

The button element has a gray background and a 2px outset style as the default value for the web browser, which can be initialized as follows:

```css
button { border:0; padding:0; background:transparent; cursor:pointer; *overflow:visible; }

```

Adding the *overflow:visible property and value is a hack to address IE 6–7 browser bugs, whose buttons grow abnormally in proportion to the length of the button text length.

### DATALIST ELEMENTS

The datalist element is a newly added element in HTML5 that displays a data list (DATA LIST). A data list is a pre-list of data that users can enter or select. This seems similar to a selection list using select elements, but there is actually a big difference.

A selection list is provided in a drop-down list scheme, where one choice is made. On the other hand, a data list is provided in the form of a typical text field, from which one can be selected or chosen as a keyword entry method. This method is similar to autocomplete. However, autocomplete is different in that if the browser stores keywords entered by the user, the data list is saved by the author himself by listing keywords. With the increasing importance of keyword search, the datalist element has been proposed as a standard technique to enable the use of the autocomplete feature without a separate program.

```html
<input list="browsers">

<datalist id="browsers">
<option value="Internet Explorer">
<option value="Firefox">
<option value="Chrome">
<option value="Opera">
<option value="Safari">
</datalist>

```

The disadvantage is that the list is not distinguished from a typical text field, and the list is only displayed by clicking the mouse where the text is entered.

| Internet Express | Firefox | Safari | Chrome | Opera |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| IE10+ | Support | Unsupported | Support | Support | Support | Support |

### KEYGEN ELEMENTS

The keygen element is a newly added element in HTML5 that displays the KEY GENERATOR. When a form is transferred, this element creates a control that allows the private key to be stored in the local key database and the public key to be transferred to the server with the form data.

Authentication or security requires mutual verification between the client (browser) and the server, which can generate the required key values by keygen elements.

```html
<form action="demo_keygen.asp" method="get">
Encryption: <keygen name="security">
<input type="submit">
</form>

```

The keytype attribute specifies the key type. This property determines the encryption method for key generation and has the following attribute values.

- `keytype="rsa" (default)
- `keytype="dsa"`
- `keytype="ec"`

The challenge property specifies the query value. When an authentication procedure is required for form submission, an empty string is submitted if the challenge attribute is not specified to submit the query value to the server with the public key.

### METER ELEMENTS

The meter element is a newly added element in HTML5, indicating the METER gauge. An instrument is a device that identifies or records the amount or direction that is intended to be measured as the instructional output. The implementation of this element looks like a progress bar, which is expected to cause confusion in use. This element is a standard technique for displaying a certain size, such as "current disk usage", but is not suitable for expressing values that represent only size, such as weight and height. Therefore, it should be used to determine relative sizes, such as minimum, maximum, low, and high.

```html
<meter value="2" min="0" max="10">2 out of 10</meter><br>
<meter value="0.6">60%</meter>

```

It is desirable to provide alternative content in text format because content implemented with meter elements is often visual and some browsers may not be able to implement this element.

The low property specifies a range of low values. The instrument can be divided into low, middle, high, and optimal regions, the low property represents the reference value for the low region.

The high property specifies a range of high values. This property represents the reference value for the high region.

The optim property specifies a range of optimal values. If this property is not specified, the intermediate value between the minimum and maximum values is the optimal value.

The value property specifies real data that is actually measured.

The max property specifies the highest value recognizable by the meter.

The min attribute specifies the lowest value recognizable by the meter.

### PROGESS ELEMENTS

The progress element indicates the progress status (PROGESS). If the meter element represents the completion state, the progress element represents the progress state. Progress is variable, not stationary, and calculated by the maximum and present values.

As with meter elements, content implemented as a progress element is highly visual, and some browsers may not be able to implement this element, so it is desirable to provide alternative content in text format. Since there is no specification for specifying the unit of measure, the unit of measure is now represented using the title property.

The progress status can be divided into the case of knowing and not knowing the progress so far. If known, a progress bar appears based on the calculation of the maximum value and the present value, but if not known, there is no current value, so the progress bar does not appear.

```html
Downloading ...
<progress value="5000" max="10000">
<span id="status">50</span>%
</progress>

```

This element can dynamically provide download status by linking the value attribute with JavaScript.

### OUTPUT ELEMENTS

The output element is a newly added element in HTML5, which displays the computational results (OUTPUT). This element is intended to show the calculated data and requires input controls such as input, meter, and progress elements for the input, as well as scripts for the calculation.

```html
<form oninput="x.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">0
<input type="range" id="a" value="50">100
+<input type="number" id="b" value="50">
=<output name="x" for="a b"></output>
</form>

```

It is difficult to distinguish between input and output situations if inputs and outputs are combined on one screen. Therefore, an element is needed that can clearly indicate that the information is output, and an output element is used in this case, the output element is used.
