undefined

`undefined` is a global property and corresponds to a raw value.

That is, one of the raw types of JavaScript.

### Syntax Description

`undefined` is the property of a global object.

That is, a variable within a global scope.

In modern browsers (JavaScript 1.8.5 / Firefox 4+) undefined is a non-configurable, non-writeable property for each ECMAScript 5 specification.

Avoid override even when this is not the case.

The variable that is not assigned a value is of the undefined type.

The method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that should be performed is not assigned a value.

The function returns undefined if the value is not returned.

Because undefined is not a reservation term, it can be used as an identifier (variable name) for any scope other than the global scope.

```js
(function(){
var undefined = 'foo';
console.log(undefined, typeof undefined);
// Leave a log called "foo string"
})();

(function(undefined){
console.log(undefined, typeof undefined); }
// Leave a log called "foo string"
)('foo');
```

Strict equality (===) and undefined

Users can use undefined and use strict equal (===) and non-equal (!==) operators to determine if a variable has a value.

In the following code, the variable x is undefined, and the if statement would be true.

```js
var x;
if (x === undefined) {
// This statement has been executed
}
else {
// This statement is not executed
}
```

### Type of operator and undefined

```js
var x;
if (typeof x === 'undefined') {
// This statement has been executed
}
```

One of the reasons why `type of` is that it does not throw errors even if variables are not declared.

```js
'// x not previously declared
if (type of x === 'undefined') { // evaluate true without error
// This statement has been executed
}

if(x === undefined){ // ReferenceError 를 던짐

}
```

However, you should avoid this kind of technique.

Because JavaScript is a static scope language, we know if we can read declared variables by seeing if it is declared within the context that surrounds it.

The only exception is the global scope, which is bound by global objects.

Therefore, checking the existence of variables within the global context can be done by checking the existence of the property of the global object. (for example, use the in operator).

### void operator and undefined

The `void` operator can be a third alternative./p>

```js
var x;
if (x === void 0) {
// This statement has been executed
}

// y has never been declared before
if (y === void 0) {
// Throw ReferenceError (for 'type of')
}
```
