Here`s another way to replace the placeholder property with the feeling of going back in time machine. In the past, when the placeholder property was not supported, we used the label element to give hints. Even if the purpose of use is not specific...

### In-Field Labels jQuery Plugin 소개

It is a simple plug-in that creates a properly formatted HTML form that supports label elements inside the field. When the label element is focused, the letter becomes blurred and disappears when the letter input is started. If you clear the field and lose focus, letters appear again.

- IE6+ (IE6 must set the value of the `background-color` property of the label element as the background of the field)
- WebKit Browsers (Safari, Chrome)
- Firefox 2+

### In-Field Labels jQuery Plugin 사용법

First of all, write the HTML structure in the following way.

```html
<p>
<label for="field_id">Label Text</label><br />
<input type="text" name="field_id" value="" id="field_id" placeholder="">
</p>

```

Write the CSS base frame so that the label is positioned appropriately above the input or textarea element. In the example, the `p` element is used to prepare a block element surrounding the label and input elements.

```css
form p { position: relative; }
form p br { display: none; }
label { position: absolute; top: 0; left:0; cursor: text }

```

After inserting the jQuery library, activate the plug-in as shown below.

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
$("label").inFieldLabels();
});

```

Options can be pre-set on all inFieldLabel controls or passed with the method.

To set it up in advance, set it up in the following way.

```undefined
$.inFieldLabels.defaultOptions.optionName = "";

```

To deliver on a call, set it in the following manner.

```js
$("label").inFieldLabels({ optionName:value });

```

- `fadeOpacity` : values are between 0.1 and 1.0.
When the field is focused, the opacity value of the label is animated. Default value is 0.5
- `fadeDuration`: Milliseconds
When an animation occurs, the animation sets the period. Default value is 300
- `pollDuration` : Time in milliseconds to release polling or 0
When set to a number greater than 0, the code checks the value of the field at a specified interval until the content is detected in this field. When content is detected or entered, polling stops in this field.
- `*className`: The class is applied to each label in an improved manner. If `false` or `"" is set, the class is not set. Default value is false
- `enabledInputTypes`: The type value of the input element allows the array.
In general, labels in the form of checkbox and radio are not desirable to fade out. The type property of this input element is allowed to be controlled. 기본값은 `["text", "search", "tel", "url", "email", "password", "textarea"]`

### Known Issues

There is a problem with duplicate labels and autocomplete fields. In this case, `pollDuration` can be transferred to a number greater than zero and polling can be turned on. To set up polling globally for use, change default: `$.InFieldLabels.defaultOptions.pollDuration = 300`
