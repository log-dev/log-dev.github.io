Learn the basic grammar of PHP.

### PHP Default Syntax

PHP is interpreted as a reference to HTML mode, and then when it encounters a start tag that indicates the start of PHP, it is interpreted as switching to PHP mode. The interpretation of this method provides the basis for PHP to be included in any document, as the PHP interpreter ignores any part outside the start and end tags.

```php
'<p>This part is ignored by the PHP interpreter.</p>
<?phpecho 'This part is interpreted by the PHP interpreter.'; ?>

```

| Start Tag | End Tag | Description |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <?php | ? | How to distinguish it from XML |
| <? | ? | In a simplified way, PHP's default setting does not allow short tags. It is available by changing to ``short_open_tag = On'' in the php.ini file. |
| <% | %> | ASP Method |
| <script language="php"> | </script> | Script Method |

```php
'<?phpecho 'To be compatible with XHTML or XML documents, write like this'; ?>

<script language="php">
'Echo' says that some editors (like front pages)
I don't like processing commands';
</script>

<?echo 'This is the simplest SGML processing command'; ?>
<?= expression ?>은 "<? "echo expression ?>" seems to have been written briefly.

<% echo ("You can also write ASP style tags"); %>
<%= $variable; # This is a simple "% echo. .." %>

```

### PHP Command Separation

PHP should terminate each command phrase end with a semicolon (;), just as a period (.) at the end of the sentence.

- Explicitly expressing the end of a sentence increases the readability and clarity of the code, and PHP interpreters can easily distinguish sentences without understanding the context.
- If there is only one sentence, or if there is an end tag (?>) immediately after the sentence, PHP automatically applies a semicolon.

```php
<?php
echo 'This is a test';
?>

<?php echo 'This is a test' ?>

Skip the '?phpecho' last close tag';

```

### PHP Annotation

PHP provides the same form of annotation as C and Perl, which the PHP interpreter ignores when encountered.

| Annotation Method | Description |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| // | Single-line annotation |
| \# | Single-line annotation |
| /\* \*/ | Multi-line Annotation |

```php
<?php
echo 'This is a test'; // one-line c++ style annotation

/* Multiple lines of annotation
Annotated up to this line */
echo 'This is yet another test';

echo 'One Final Test'; # One-line comment in shell format
?>
```

### Things that you consider to be PHP empty.

These are what you need to know when you examine PHP`s conditional statements or, in other cases, values contained in variables.

- ```` : Empty string
- `0` : Integer 0
- `"0" : string 0
- `NULL`
- `FALSE`
- `array() : Empty array
- `var $var;` : Variables Declared Without Value in Class
