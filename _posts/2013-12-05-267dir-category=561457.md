Packets sent from the computer are relayed by a relay device called a hub or router to move toward the destination. The content of the data or the content of the TCP protocol control information does not affect the behavior of carrying packets, as the relaying device relays the packets without looking at the data portion.

### LAN Cable Features

Packets that are shaped from LAN adapters to electrical signals are transferred to twisted pair cables (korn sun pairs) via the RJ-45 connector. The transmitted signal does not arrive at the hub as it is, but when it arrives at the hub, the signal weakens, causing the waveform to collapse or distort due to noise.

The cause of the noise is the electromagnetic waves generated around the cable. Because of the nature that electromagnetic waves touch challengers such as metals, electric currents occur in them, if there are electromagnetic waves around the cable, currents different from signals flow inside the cable. This results in a mix of signal and noise currents, which deforms the signal`s waveform.

Electromagnetic waves from outside the cable can be blocked by "twisting" the cable, and noise generated from the inside can be solved by twisting differently.

### Repeater Hub

The repeater hub transmits the arrived signal throughout the LAN. Upon receiving the signal, the device examines the destination MAC address written in the MAC header at the front, receiving it if it corresponds to the destination, and otherwise ignoring the received signal.
