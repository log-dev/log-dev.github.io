Describe the `meta` element included in the head element. It`s a place where you write down descriptions one by one and draw the completion of a web document.

### Metadata (METADATA)

Metadata means "data about data". There are no rules as to what information should be made up of information about documents. Typically, information that can help identify the nature of a document, such as an author, copyright, keyword, and language, is included. This information is for machines (browser, search engine) rather than people.

### charset properties

The charset property specifies a character set. A character set is a collection of all the characters needed to represent the spoken language, including symbols, spaces, etc. Character encoding is the conversion of a character set into a format suitable for use on a computer. That is, a rule that makes a character set in a machine-understandable format. Under this rule, one character set can have multiple encodings, and only when the browser knows the encoding correctly can it be interpreted correctly and represented as a character.

All HTML documents must be encoded, and this declaration must be made only once per document. Of course, even if the encoding method is not declared, the browser can render HTML documents on its own, but not all browsers do.

```html
<meta charset="utf-8" />

```

In Korea, there are about euc-kr and utf-8 characters used for web pages.

- It can express 2,350 Korean characters, Chinese characters and English characters used in Korea.
- It is used when only characters within a limited range are used to prepare documents.
- Process Korean characters into two bytes.

- Unicode is an encoding that can represent all characters in the world. It will be possible to express Korean written by us on any computer in all parts of the world, which has never been seen before.
- Because Korean characters are treated as three bytes, the document can be somewhat larger, but it shows the flexibility of handling spaces or English characters as one byte.
- If you write a character set as UTF-8 you must also save the file type as UTF-8 when you save HTML files.

- HTTP charset parameters in the Content-Type field
- Content-Type and charset properties by http-equiv of META elements
- charset properties for a particular element

charset must be declared before `<title>`.

### http-equiv properties

The unit of data sent and received by a client-server communication is called an HTTP message, which consists of an HTTP header, body, and trailer. In order to reduce the number of requests and transmissions, clients and servers process HTTP headers before processing the body of HTTP messages, so providing proper HTTP headers can increase the efficiency of the work between clients and servers. The property `http-equiv` specifies the same value as this HTTP header.

The following is a description of the http-equiv attribute value.

It specifies the type of content, which specifies the character encoding scheme and is an alternative format to the charset property. Declaration of the character encoding scheme must be made only once, whether it is a charset property or a http-equiv property.

```html
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

```

Specifies the default style sheet. If multiple types of style sheets are defined by LINK elements, then the default style sheets are specified. Specifies the title property value of the LINK element as the content property, and the style sheet of the LINK element becomes the default style sheet.

```html
<meta http-equiv="default-style" content="phone">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="phone.css" title="phone">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="desktop.css" title="desktop">

```

Specifies a refresh of the document. The attribute value is specified as a numeric value, which means the time period in seconds. When a URL is specified, it automatically moves to the document in that URL at the same time as the refresh occurs. If the URL is not specified, the current document will be reloaded.

```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60; url=example.html">
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60">

```

It is a property to respond to compatibility modes created by the development of IE8. IE=edge is always rendered using the latest standard engine.

```html
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

```

### name property

The name property specifies the metadata name. If the metadata is named by this attribute, the content attribute specifies the purpose and nature of the metadata. Name and content properties are written in pairs, and name and content property values are written in the name properties. Metadata with high importance or frequently used values of the name attribute as shown below.

The following is a description of the name attribute.

Specifies the Web application name. This property value cannot be used when it is not a web application and can only be specified once within a document.

```html
<meta name="application-name" content="Gmail">

```

Specifies the author`s name (author). Typically, the provider or developer name is entered.

```html
<meta name="author" content="Douglas Ham">

```

Specifies the document description. The search engine shows this document description as a search result. It can only be specified once within a document.

```html
'<meta name="description" content="Summary of the current page, description">

```

Specifies the authoring tool used to create the document. This attribute shall not be used when the author does not use the author`s tools and is prepared himself.

```html
<meta name="generator" content="Dreamweaver CS5.5">

```

Specify a keyword. This keyword is written in words related to the content of the document and can be provided with multiple keywords using commas.

```html
<meta name="keyword" content="html, css, javascript, php">

```

The META element in a web document can be used to provide keywords or descriptions. These keywords and descriptions do not appear in web documents, but help users` tools such as search engines to predict document content. Of course, search engine services such as Google do not refer to keywords and descriptions of metadata at all or only limitedly because unrelated keywords and descriptions can be included randomly like spam keywords.

It controls the screen size of various devices such as mobile and tab.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

```

`width=device-width` is set to a screen size (320px). If web documents are flexible desktop designs, it is better to use these attributes and attribute values on mobile devices. Also, a fixed desktop design is not a problem, and a mobile design is nothing more.

`Intial-scale=1` uses zoom a lot in mobile browsers, and if it is necessary to prevent it for optimal use environments, the attribute value is fixed at 1.

The content property values are as follows.

- user-scalable=no : whether users are allowed to view magnifications (yes/no)
- intial-scale=1.0 : Expansion ratio for page loading
- maximum-scale=1.0 : maximum expansion rate
- minimum-scale=1.0 : Minimum livestock consumption rate
- width=device-width : fits the horizontal size of the platform, and if you put the figure, it fits the figure.
- target-densitydpi=medium-dpi : dpi([dots per inch])

### content properties

The content property specifies the content of the meta-information. This property cannot be used alone and must be used in conjunction with the name, http-equiv property. Author definitions can lead to new metadata. In addition, frequently used metadata can be used for different purposes depending on the author`s intent, so if you use the name property to name the metadata, you should use the content property to provide metadata so that you know what it is for and what it is.
